<p>This disc contains <a href="http://www.mylittlekaraoke.com/index.php?pages/Songs">a lot more song tracks</a>,   as well as additional fixes and performance updates - all of that in an   easy-to-use package. As usual, the songs work on Windows, Mac OSX, and   Linux.</p>
<p>Features :</p>
<ul>
  <li>A lot more new songs! We've added more than 70 new tracks, not counting instrumental versions.</li>
  <li>As always, we're trying our best to focus on quality assets with 720p video backgrounds and high-quality sound when available.</li>
  <li>We've added a few extras, such as a paper song list to makes it easier to pick songs during parties.<br>
  </li>
  <li>We've added a variant of the MyLittleKaraoke skin, with a   static background. This will be useful for people who want to capture   videos using tools such as FRAPS.</li>
  <li>We've updated the Windows   version of the engine to gain a performance boost. We're now using a   cutting-edge build of Ultrastar Deluxe (nightly).<br>
  </li>
  <li>We've created a patch fixing an issue on OSX Mavericks,   preventing the game to be launched. Mavericks users must patch the game   for it to work properly.</li>
  <li>We've built an easy-to-use updater both for Windows and Mac OSX.</li>
</ul>
