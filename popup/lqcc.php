<p> LQ are Low Quality encode, it mean that its the worst release you could find on this site, however, their size is amazingly small, and they still should be better than youtube one, allowing people with low connection speed or/and traffic quota or/and low disk space to also enjoy ponies awesomeness correctly !</p>
