During the 8th Bi-Weekly Moon Princess Festival (in which Twilight drags her friends to the top of a hill at night to watch her do stuff) the moon makes a special guest appearance. But being a princess isn't as easy as magazines would have you believe. Twilight Sparkle learns valuable lessons about friendship and magic.
