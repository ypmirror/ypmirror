<p>The official TrotMania Chrystalize package contains a portable copy of   StepMania 5 Beta 2, which does not require any additional installation   or setup to use. It is pre-loaded with the TrotMania Chrystalize songs,   music videos (where applicable), theme, and marathon courses.</p>
<p>The bundled StepMania will only work on Windows; if you are on a different platform (i.e. OS X or Linux; download it from <a href="http://www.stepmania.com/wiki/Downloads">here</a> if you do not have it) or want to add the TrotMania songs to an   existing installation of StepMania 5, just copy the contents of the   "Songs" and "Courses" folders from the TrotMania package into the   "Songs" and "Courses" folder on your StepMania installation.</p>
