to move things along,

         That coin toss was only
         the beginning, Scrooge!

123
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,500
         The moment of reckoning
         is at hand, and lo--

00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,770
We've got another               
ten minutes of gloating         
before he takes a shot.         

125
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,772
Let's work on your drive.

           how a real golfer    
           would play this hole!

All right, boy,                 
how would your uncle            
play this hole?

       in the hole, I guess?    

131

Hit the ball...                 
in the hole?                    

132
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,454

133

It stayed on the course!

          that swing,

    tell me about the shortcut  
    through the weeds?!

00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,714
You tempt people                
onto your backs,                

232
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,616
then carry them off             
into the sea!                   

233
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,250
             Oh, no, no, no, no.

234
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,187
              We just got       
              out of the shower,
              that's all.       

235
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,590
                       Hmm? Hmm!

236
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,727
          Fine. That            
          is generally our plan.

237
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,794
Come on, Bramble.               

238
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,563
If they're sooo smart,          

239
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,833
they must know                  
all about the treasure          
at the end of the course.       

240
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:02,834
    Treasure?                   

241
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,968
                Treasure?       

242
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,169
First to complete               
this course                     

243
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,639
will win                        
the priceless Druid's Cup.      

244
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,174
         Thus proving them      
         to be the finest golfer

245
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,443
      in every plane of reality!

246
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,578
                    Ooh!        

247
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,346
         Uh-huh. Okay.          

248
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,614
     Well anyone else think     
        we should ignore        

249
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,583
       the murder ponies        
          and go home?          

250
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,019
You'll all                      
be sent home safely             

251
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,187
as soon as you finish           
the course.                     

252
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:27,025
              That is,<i> if</i> you   
              finish the course.

253
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,530
          Um. Did we mention    
          the trophy has        
          custom engraving? Ooh!

254
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,865
             Dewey, you've found
             your calling.      

255
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,971
Easy, lad. You can't            
just flail that thing           
at random anymore.              

256
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,539
There's too much at stake.      

257
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,808
If we lose the ball,            
we don't go home.               

258
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,210
We have got to play smart.      

259
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,546
        You might want          
        to get started.         

260
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:53,017
  It can be awful hard to play  
  once those mists roll in.     

261
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,989
             Come on,           
             we're wasting time!

262
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,457
       Caddie! My clubs!        

263
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,858
            Caddie?             

264
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,193
Ahem.                           

265
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,229
               Hop on our backs.

266
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,065
                We'll take you  
                to the next hole

267
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,867
          and definitely        
          not to a watery grave.

268
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,904
           You are the least fun
           victims ever.        

269
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,052
         What the... ?!         

270
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,887
               Aw, shoulda      
               seen that coming.

271
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,890
How? How could he have          
possibly seen that coming?      

272
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,327
         Give it back,          
     you overgrown puddle!      

273
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,996
       Aah! Caddie! Help!       

274
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,098
                Ohh! [straining]

275
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,699
                    Here!       

276
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,070
Oh, it's like you don't         
even want to be rescued.        

277
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,511
        -[zapping]              
        -[Glomgold] Aah!        

278
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,514
        Old golf tip: let       
        Flinty spring that trap,

279
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,550
               the rest         
               is just patience.

280
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,627
           Patience.            

281
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,098
           Patience.            

282
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,733
           Patience!            

283
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,969
Uh!                             
If you'd just let me--          

284
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,371
          Not the time          
    for a reckless clobber.     

285
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,007
            Come on,            
      ya blasted tentacle!      

286
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,479
         And besides,           
         you cannae just sub in.

287
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,781
              It's against      
              the rules of golf.

288
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,582
           [Briar]              
           It's okay!           

289
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,985
           Druid Golf           
      allows for twosomes!      

290
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,254
                  Water's great,
                  by the way!   

291
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,593
               Oh, give it a go.

292
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,462
           But don't get        
           too discouraged      
           if you don't make it.

293
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,333
        Uh-uh-uh-uh-uhh!        

294
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,908
Go Dewey!                       

295
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,477
              Good shot, lad.   
              Very proud of you.

296
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,912
You don't sound proud.          

297
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,580
              Yeah!             
              Scrooge and Dewey,

298
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,016
            taking on the world,
            one hole at time!   

299
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,017
[Huey]                          
There you have it.              

300
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,652
Another brash young upstart     

301
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,121
destined to surpass             
his aging mentor.               

302
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,456
       Is the commentary        
       still necessary?         

303
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,194
It helps me feel                
in control during               
a frankly insane situation.     

304
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,695
         I like talking this way

305
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,664
      'cause it makes everything
      sound important.          

306
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,200
             Baloney trampoline.

307
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,005
        [music playing]         

308
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,547
          [grumbling]           

309
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,225
                      Nailed it!

310
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,528
Whoo-hoo, yeah!                 
Go Dewey!                       

311
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,464
Scrooge, still in the lead      
on the 17th hole,               

312
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,233
but Glomgold is closing in.     

313
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,735
     Hey, so is that weird mist.

314
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,972
Nice job. Nice job.             

315
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,540
Aaand nice job.                 

316
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,808
                Not nice enough.

317
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,243
                  Glomgold's    
                  gonna pass us!

318
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,312
You bet your ballast I am!      

319
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,980
I'll prove                      
once and for all                

320
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,115
I'm the best golfer             
in this or any other--          

321
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,451
          Aah! Caddie!          

322
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,728
I'm pretty sure I can           
get it to the hole              
with one swing.                 

323
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,996
                      Let me go.

324
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,431
And risk dumping it             
down into the water?            

325
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,066
Absolutely not.                 

326
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,600
    [Briar, imitating Webby]    
    Aw, give him a chance.      

327
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,336
  If he hits it in the water,   

328
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,137
          we can jump           
   on the kelpies to get it!    

329
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,175
    I'm the small girl duck.    
       You can trust me.        

330
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,610
Oh, whoop!                      

331
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,678
            [splash]            

332
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,580
                  Come on.      
                  I can do this!

333
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,350
Do what?                        
Whack the ball blindly?         

334
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,684
             Into the hole! Yes!

335
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,319
            Like I've been doing
            all day.            

336
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,288
          Why don't you trust me
          to make this?         

337
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,156
You don't have                  
the experience.                 

338
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,158
It takes time, effort--         

339
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,460
          -Hey!                 
          -[grunting]

        -[cheering]             

341
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,303
                   [Dewey]      
                   It's so easy!

342
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,371
    No!                         

343
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,539
[growling]                      

344
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,274
          I'm sorry. I just knew
          I could, so I--       

345
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,210
You pull a club                 
out of a Scotsman's hand,       

346
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,046
you'd best be prepared          
to knock him out with it!       

347
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,647
           Hey, I made the shot.

348
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,316
You disobeyed me                

349
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,852
and risked the entire game      
with your showboating!          

350
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,620
                I'm showboating?

351
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,856
              This whole thing  
              has been about    
              how great you are.

352
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,290
          You're so worried that
          someone might actually
          be better than you    

353
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,059
                 at something   
                 that you keep--

354
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,829
See here, I am                  
an inter-dimensionally          
ranked golfer!                  

355
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,898
         Whatever. I'm over     
         this dumb sport anyway.

356
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,201
              Finish the course 
              so we can go home.

357
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,238
      Now hold on.              
      I didn't mean to...       

358
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,242
     -[whack]                   
     -[Glomgold]                
     Outta the way, McDuck!     

359
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,846
              Hah!              

360
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,357
[Huey]                          
The last hole.                  

361
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,260
           Looks like some      
           sort of Hall of Fame.

362
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,264
         Well, your old Uncle   
         Scrooge will be joining
         it soon enough, eh?    

363
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,599
Let's get this over with.       

364
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,039
Scrooge, lining up,             
and none too soon.              

365
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,741
Morale is not high.             

366
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,443
        Uh, Mr. McDuck?         

367
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,845
     Those mists are            
     getting really close.      

368
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,415
     Well, that's ominous.      

369
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,320
[Huey] And he hooks it          
onto the wall.                  

370
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,962
Nice work. How are you          
going to get up there?          

371
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,197
        [Glomgold]              
        It's happening.         

372
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,865
      I'm one stroke away       

373
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,267
  from claiming the trophy      
  and beating Scrooge McDuck!   

374
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,371
 As soon as I take this swing,  
    I, Flintheart Glomgold,     

375
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,874
     will be the winner of      
the Billionaire's Club Classic. 

376
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,643
     Sure, you may have won     
        the previous 27,        

377
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,479
          but I think           
        we can all agree        

378
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,380
        this one counts         
  more than the rest combined.  

379
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,982
          Uh, Flinty?           

380
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,150
       Stuff it, Scrooge.       

381
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,384
    I'm savoring the moment.    

382
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,752
     Caddie, savor with me.     

383
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,987
            Caddie?             

384
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,089
            [growls]            

385
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,591
                           Um...

386
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,759
           Oh. I see.           

387
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,394
       Curse you, McDuck!       

388
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,396
     Curse you and my love      
     of moment-savoring!        

389
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,465
Aah!                            

390
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,468
     The mist turns people      
           to stone!            

391
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,437
      Those statues used        
      to be real golfers!       

392
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,505
      [sinister laughter]       

393
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,607
Oh, by the way,                 
the mists of Moorshire?         

394
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,442
They turn mortals to stone.     

395
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,576
Those statues are--             

396
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,979
You just said all that,         
didn't you?                     

397
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,315
               So you're doomed.

398
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,351
          Better to let us drown
          you instead. Let's go!

399
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,485
           [all] No!            

400
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,521
You people are no fun.          

401
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,796
       We have to finish        
       the course.              

402
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,633
     Those hoofed hostiles      
   said it would get us home.   

403
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,168
           [grunting]           

404
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,373
             Everybody! We need 
             to support Scrooge!

405
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,376
         Why? He hasn't         
     supported me all day.      

406
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,012
             No, we need        
             to<i> support</i> Scrooge.

407
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,313
Not everything                  
is a life lesson!               

408
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,223
        [all straining]         

409
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,529
Louie! Hand me the club!        

410
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,733
      Oh, right, sure.          
      Nope, not the time.       

411
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,469
    Oh, my.                     

412
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,005
   Scrooge, taking his time,    
       I'm not sure why.        

413
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,540
   There are lives at stake.    

414
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,576
Wait, whose?                    

415
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,644
Oh, right.                      

416
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,979
            [groans]            

417
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,480
    This has been Huey Duck,    
          signing off!          

418
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,382
    Man, I hate this sport.     

419
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,818
[Webby]                         
Come on, Scrooge,               
I know you can do it.           

420
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,753
        Webby! Guys! No!        

421
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,888
   What are you waiting for?    

422
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,190
     Take the stupid shot!      

423
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,425
            -Not me.            
            -What?              

424
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,727
I cannae make the shot.         
You can.                        

425
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,267
I know you can do it.           

426
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,238
          Okay, okay.           
 Filter out all distractions.   

427
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,607
   Hips back. Shoulders down.   
          Tail tucked.          

428
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,875
      Aah! Whack the ball!      
        Whack the ball!         

429
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,620
          [bell rings]          

430
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,921
              Yes!              

431
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,495
             -Aah!              
             -Oof!              

432
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,800
               You did it, lad! 
               I knew you could!

433
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,436
[Briar] Congratulations,        
champions!                      

434
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,605
   You are the first players    

435
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,608
        to ever complete        
        the Druid's Cup.        

436
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,178
           Go on. You earned it.

437
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,384
          [Dewey]               
          "Scroge" and "Douise"?

438
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,152
Sorry.                          
It was a rush job.              

439
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,388
    We really didn't expect     
    you to make it.             

440
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,658
Now, who's up                   
for a victory swim?             

441
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:01,592
           [all] No!            

442
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,761
                        Yaah!   

443
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,934
You! You let me                 
turn to stone!                  

444
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:14,438
You're the worst caddie ever!   
You're fired!                   

445
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,609
As soon as you help me out.     

446
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,844
    Ahh!                        

447
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,649
      -[whack]                  
      -[Glomgold screams]       

448
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,484
          You know, we could use
          another player        

449
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,687
                 for next year's
                 Invitational.  

450
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,356
            I'd love someone    
            who actually gave me
            a run for my money. 

451
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,158
Eh, I think                     
my pro career is over.          

452
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,693
I'm going out on top.           

453
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,861
Still, I'd be up for            
a friendly round now and then.  

454
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,496
                   Sounds grand.

455
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,465
    Whooo! Screwy for life!     

456
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,334
         In your face,          
   everybody who's not them!    

457
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,501
           Whoo-hoo!            

458
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,470
                  Maybe just    
                  the two of us.

459
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,138
Well, there                     
you have it, folks.             

460
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,873
Scrooge let go of his ego       

461
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,709
and learned that                
a good teacher's pride          

462
