00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:41,386

00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,729

              in no way         
              inconveniences me.

70
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,797
                       Good day.

71
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
This may be                     
Mr. McDuck's mansion,           

72
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,069
but it's my house.              

73
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,938
So... my house rules.           

74
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,275
Exhaustive.

Where are you going?            

75
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:06,111
      I got unmentionables      
            to wash.            

76
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,580
            Rule 58:            
     If you need something,     

77
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,916
   ask for permission first.    

78
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,019
Did you hear that, boys?        
Ask permission.                 

79
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,255
           Rule #23:            
  No one is above the rules...  

80
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,190

81
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,392
       If you had simply        
     asked for assistance,      

82
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,960
      we could've avoided       
    what I'm referring to as    

83
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,795
  the "Undergarment Incident."  

84

( kids laughing )               

85
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,432
   I can take care of myself.   

86
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,435
          That is not           
          your decision to make.

87
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,604
               You live here,   
               you answer to me.

88
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,873
I answer to                     
no one!                         

89
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,645
        - Wait, are they        
        gonna kiss?             
        - ALL: Eww!             

90
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,713
       BOTH: Outside now.       

91
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,819
                     Death Darts
                     was fun.   

92
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,888
      Again, just supposed      
          to be darts.          

93
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,223
What do you                     
wanna play next?                

94
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,925

        Cannonball Fury?        

95

               How about a nice,
               safe nap?        

96
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,864
         Oh, how about          
          Sacky Sack?           

97
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:08,307
           Or we could go       
        have some real fun.     

98
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,410
         - You mean...          
     - I do, dear Dewford.      

99
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:15,080

104

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,639
          You coming?           

114
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,174
          What? Yeah!           

115
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,909
      Let me get my stuff.      

116
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,714
I don't know. Webby's great     
for treasure hunting            

117
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,282
and mine cart chases,           

118
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:53,018
but she's not exactly built     
for every-day kid stuff.        

119
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,519
     I still see the darts      
     when I close my eyes.      

120
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,722
      She's been cooped up      
  in a mansion her whole life.  

121
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,857
     Of course she's gonna      
      be a little... off.       

122
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,659
      But we can help her;      
        she'll be fine.         

123
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,894
       All right, Webby,        
 just a totally casual hang-out 

124
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:06,331
       in the real world.       
     like regular kids do.      

125
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,533
         Play it cool,          
         play it cool.          

126
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:13,472
                    Whooooo!    

127
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,082
              Hmm.              

128
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:28,820
          ( humming )           

129
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,097
        Howdy, neighbor.        
           Kielbasa?            

130
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,900
   I'll just live on the boat   
        while I fix it.         

131
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,770
       Out of your house,       
        out of your way.        

132
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,772
        Causing several         
         fire hazards.          

133
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,673
  If you had checked with me,   

134
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,942
      I could've provided       
   safe electrical hook-ups.    

135
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,946
    - I'm good.                 
    - And how would you like    
    to split the water bill?    

136
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:59,117
   Richest duck in Duck Burg    
      can't spare a dime.       

137
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,919
        Keep your water.        

138
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,403
          ( excited whimpering )

139
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,272
      You've been on a bus      
         before, right?         

140
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,374
                     Absolutely.

141
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,609
               So is it assigned
               seating or...    

142
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,748
          Don't talk to anybody,
          don't touch anything, 

143
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,117
            don't lick anything,
            don't go near       
            the emergency brake.

144
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:41,993
       Ooh, ooh. Ha ha!         
           I'm Webby.           

145
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,297
Have you ever jumped            
a ravine in this baby?          
Can I try? I'm Webby.           

146
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,941
          Look, a dog,          
       wearing a bow tie.       

147
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,509
Did he tie it                   
himself?                        

148
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,144
Stop the bus!                   

149
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,854
                   It was a nice
                   bow tie.     

150
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,689
            - Sorry.            
          - It's fine.          

151
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,457
     It's just a short walk     
          to Funso's.           

152
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,527
          Through the sketchiest
          neighborhood in town. 

153
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,501
                   Bet it's     
                   a faster run.
                   Race ya!     

154
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,202
             ( sighs )          
             Wrong way.         

155
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,770
Whoop.                          

156
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,142
Hey, is that                    
the McDuck brats?               

157
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,278
        - Let's get 'em.        
            - Uh-uh.            

158
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,313
        Burger's right.         
           Ma told us           

159
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,382
       we's only supposed       
    to take down the truck.     

160
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,484
       Forget the truck.        
       That's the payday.       

161
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,086
           Think big.           

162
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,024
Sorry, Carl.                    
Same time next month?

        Sweet Webbigail,

       Webby, your money        
        is no good here.        

178
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,779
       What do they take?       
 I have pounds, pesos, rubles.  

179
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,081
      The oldest currency       
         in the world.          

180
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,382
        Ancient obsidian

         No, flattery.

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,886
      Ahem. I can't tell.       

183
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,188
     Is that the heat lamps     
     or your natural glow?      

184
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,190
Oh, Mr. Duck,                   
the usual?                      

185
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,627
       Yep. One free cup        
       for water, please.       

186
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,199
      - That's not water.       
      - It's all part           
      of the system.            

187
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,401

00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,115
                    You know,   
                    fruit punch.

195
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:21,786
You sure you don't              
want it for water?              

196
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,321
                 Yes, for water.

197
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,256
                 Fruity water...

198
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,925
                  that really   
                  packs a punch.

199
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,326
                     Am I right?

200
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,328
I don't know                    
what you mean.                  

201
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,563
      I mean fruit punch.       

202
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,198
           There a problem here?

  handing out freebies, Jane?   

204
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,976
          You pay for           
       that punch, Duck?        

205
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,945

00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,344
                Japanese import.

223
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,846
                There's only one
                in the U.S.     

224
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,347
           and I have           
       the top ten score,       

225
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,349
       so I'm pretty much       
    the best in the country.    

226
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,651
          You gotta try this.   

227
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,519
I don't know.                   
I've never actually             

228
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,055
played a computer game.         

229
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,824
                  Do you play   
                  an instrument?

230
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,425
I took seven years              
of cello.                       

231
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,993
                 Same thing.    

232
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,467
        Oh!                     

233
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,239
               Your first strum.
               Cherish it.      

234
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,510
      ( computer speaking       
           Japanese )           

235
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,413
                Yes, yes, be one
                with the flow.  

236
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,415
     ( speaking Japanese )      

237
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,918
           I am both uking      
             and puking.        

238
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,020
         - Time for...          
    - Strangers are danger!     

239
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,455
                      Webby, no!

240
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,597
               I killed Funso.  

241
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,166
            No, no.             
      Don't you die on me!      

242
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:56,641
           My scores.           
              No!!              

243
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,277
          It's like I don't     
          even know you anymore.

244
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,974
      Perhaps we could put      
      your nephew up in a hotel.

245
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,843
        In New Zealand.         

246
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,511
         No time.               
         Guest bath's a-callin'.

247
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,046
                Beakley problem.

248
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,651
             - Ow.              
     - Room for three more?     

249
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,588
             You guys aren't mad
             I ruined Funso's?  

250
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,757
       Please. Funso's is       
        a place of magic        

251
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,692
    and wonder and light.       

252
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,928
                    Think fast! 

253
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,132
    Wait. What's happening?     

254
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,433
       Nope, you're fine.       

255
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,502
          It's a trap.          
          I'm sinking.          

256
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,171
         ( screaming )          

257
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,448
     ( fire alarm blaring )     

258
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,085
       ( nervous laugh )        
           I'm Webby.           

259
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,457
         You are banned         
     from Funso's for life.     

260
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,393
  No, please. I've never been   
    kicked out of anything.     

261
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,563
     And this is why I said     
    we shouldn't bring her.     

262
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,398
Thanks, Dewey.                  

263
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,469
           Funso, take them out.

264
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,504
         With pleasure.         

265
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,106
            Call Ma.            

266
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:42,280
You can't come in               
without a child.                

267
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,821
         Everybody out!         

268
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,261
        This is it, Ma.         

269
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,230
        The big payday.         
       The perfect scam.        

270
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,366
Save it.                        
What's so important             
that I don't see                

271
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,067
an armored car                  
parked out front?               

272
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,037
             May I present      
          our new meal ticket?  

273
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,872
     ( imitates drum roll )     

274
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,540
    Scrooge McDuck's family.    

275
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,410
             ( all jabbering )  

276
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,447
        And how did you         
          manage this?          

277
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,284
     Well, we cornered 'em,     
        we captured 'em,        

278
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,852
        and we sent him         
         a ransom note.         

279
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,587
         You did what?          

280
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,633
  How did someone so brilliant  
       raise such morons?       

281
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,136
I think she's                   
talking about you.              

282
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,704
        But Scrooge will        
         pay a fortune          

283
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,539
          to get them           
       ankle biters back.       

284
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,242
   Do you think he got to be    
   the richest duck in Duck Burg

285
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,210
           by paying people off?

286
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,913
           You just painted     
           four twerp-size      
           targets on our backs.

287
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,449
                Bouncer, Burger,
                go wait outside.

288
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,152
       What about me, Ma?       

289
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,623
You're on                       
a time-out, mister.             

290
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,291
      Who are these guys?       

291
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,293
The Beagle boys.                
They hate your uncle.           

292
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,095
Try to break into               
the mansion all the time.       

293
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,463
         Are they gonna         
           ransom us?           

294
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,966
        Scrooge will never pay  
         for all four of us.    

295
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,668
You're right.                   
He'll probably throw            
one of us off a cliff           

296
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,370
to send Scrooge                 
a message.                      

297
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,944
       Scrooge, the kids!       

298
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,412
        The Beagle Boys!        

299
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,417
    Wait. Something's wrong.    

300
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,521
          Much better.          

301
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,792
               Mrs. B., a brick,
               a note.          

302
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,695
       Look who's finally       
     coming to ask for my--     

303
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,030
                    Help!!      

304
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,700
        What is a Funso?        

305
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,536
    Don't capture Scrooge's     
        brats, Big Time.        

306
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,638
         Don't stick up         
the policeman's ball, Big Time. 

307
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,507
       Tanks don't float,       
           Big Time.            

308
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,043
      She always treats me      
      like the odd man out      

309
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,312
       - because my ideas       
       are too--                
       - Intense?               

310
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,114
           Visionary.           

311
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,548
      Well, I'll show her.      

312
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,183
       I'll show 'em all.       

313
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,185
      That's not something      
         you wanna hear         

314
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,788
     - when you're tied up      
     in a meat locker.          
     - Startin' with you.       

315
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,391
ALL: Webby?!                    

316
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,493
          Oops. Sorry.          
          I'll just...          

317
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,461
     You could slip out of      
     those ropes the whole time?

318
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,063
Well, yeah.                     
That's, like,                   

319
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,731
Being Captured 101.             

320
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,566
       So why didn't you?       

321
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,636
    Because I don't want you    
      to think I'm weird.       

322
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,638
       I've been stuck in       
    the mansion for so long,    

323
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,673
         and I'm trying         
   really hard to be normal.    

324
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:26,744
But everything I do             
is, you know, not.              

325
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,579
      Normal's overrated.       

326
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,649
       We need you to be        
         Webby-normal.          

327
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,594
        I'm gonna break         
    every bone in her body.     

328
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,631
Or maybe just tie her up.       
We'll see how it plays out.     

329
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,377
                All right, boys.

330
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:02,413
     McDuck's high-falutin'     
        hooligan Beakley        

331
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,715
         is coming here         
       to take you down.        

332
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,616
          Are you gonna let her?

333
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,351
Mmm...                          

334
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,420
        No, you are not.        

335
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,056
     Beakley may be strong,     
   ruthless and unforgiving,    

336
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,925
          but you are           
        the Beagle Boys.        

337
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,460
            My boys.            

338
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,362
       It's time to mark        
        your territory.         

339
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,601
           Do it for            
       your dear old ma.        

340
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,107
        "Dear Ma Beagle,        
    if you ever want to see     

341
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,741
       your son again..."       

342
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,143
    Oh, for cryin' out loud.    

343
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,616
              You take care     
                 of them.       

344
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,885
                  I'll deal with
                  the squirts.  

345
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,827
      Beagle Boys are slow      
        but quite large.        

346
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,129
     I'll take the big one      
         and... Donald?         

347
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,166
      Give me back              
        my boys!                

348
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,207
       Get off me.              

349
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,547
         I guess he can         
     take care of himself.      

350
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,988
         Come on, kids.         

351
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,756
  I don't have time for games.  

352
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,992

358
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:01,566
    Oh! You can't outrun me.    

359
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,201
       You know how many        
        two-foot terrors        

360
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,169
        I chased around         
         the junkyard?          

361
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,837
  But I'm not outrunning you.   

362
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,474
             Whee!              
        I'm leaving you.        

363
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,546
                   Hi, Ma.      

364
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,548
      Seriously, Big Time?      

365
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,887
          What the...           
    Stupid plastic garbage.     

366
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,456
        Wait, no, stop.         
          It's a trap!          

367
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,793
      I know, right? Now!       

368
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,905
Boys!                           

369
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,276
A slipstitch.                   
Good choice, dear.              

370
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,677
             Thanks, Granny.    

371
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,246
                  It's okay, Ma.

372
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,181
            I tried, and that's 
            what matters, right?

373
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,850
Shut up, Big Time.              

374
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:56,254
               Why can't we have
               what they have?  

375
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,856
          Now flip the circuit  
          on the boat's panel   
          and you'll have power.

376
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,460
Thanks, Mrs. B.                 

377
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,263
So how does a housekeeper       
know so much                    

378
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,965
about electricity               
and Tae Kwon Do?                

379
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,700
                     Oh, simple.
                     I'm a spy. 

380
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,143
Nice of Funso's                 
to lift the ban                 

381
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,645
and give us                     
all those free tokens,          

382
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,046
you know, to keep us            
from suing them.                

383
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,648
           Yep, the system      
                works.          

384
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,049
       So what should           
        we do next?             

385
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,885
I don't know. Webby?            
What do you wanna play?         

386
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,787
     - Really? You mean it?     
  - Any crazy thing you want.   

387
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,989
         Oh, how about          
       a nice game of...        

388
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,759
      Medieval Dungeon of       
       Eternal Screaming?       

389
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,327
