      "To those who serve       
      the Pharaoh Toth-Ra,

    he brings golden reward,    

114

      but beware all those      
        who cross him."         

115
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,145
       And then something       
    I can't quite translate.    

116
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,813
        Something about a curse?

117
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,215
               Being stuck here 
               for all eternity?

118
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,283
Fine by me!                     

119
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,818
Mm, best not to                 
touch anything                  

120
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,453
until we find Mr. McDuck.       

121
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,056
           -Let's go.           
    -Or maybe we stay here.     

122
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,791
               It's a room      
               full of treasure.

123
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,159
       Scroogey's gonna find it.

124
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,928
       Good thinking.           
       Still, don't touch...    

125

       [sighs] Anything.

And that's my hut,              

128
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,737
and that's a public             
waste hole.                     

129
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,105
      They're awful close       
         to each other.         

130
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,940
It does not                     
smell great,                    

131
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:13,011
but Almighty Toth-Ra decreed    
this is where I am to live.     

132
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,681
              Oh, and here's the
              Temple of Toth-Ra.

133
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,984
See here, Amunet.               

134
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,419
My kids are trapped.            

135
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,521
Now you take me                 
to the pharaoh this instant.    

136
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,824
            No need. The pharaoh
            will be here soon.  

137
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,367
       Bless me bagpipes.

140
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,018
                 He has accepted
                 our offering.  

141
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,021
              It is time for    
              our golden reward.

142
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,889
           I give you           

143
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,726
            the sun!

             -Wait!             

146
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,039
         Get back here!         

147
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,045
      Great day, everyone.      

148
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,548
        If we skip meals        
and start harvesting right now, 

149
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,818
      maybe he'll bring us      
  a full hour of sun tomorrow.  

150
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,588
You know a mummy                
doesn't actually                
bring you the sun, right?       

151
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,056
The Earth spins                 
on its axis, creating--         

152

    Aww, not the sharpest sickle
    in the shed, are you, kid?  

153
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,927
 I got a Junior Woodchuck badge 

154
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,896
      in sickle sharpening      
      that says otherwise.

       leave that alone.

treasure hunting:               

157
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,503
If it might be cursed,          
don't touch it.                 

158
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,072
   You said you weren't sure    
    what the prophecy meant.    

159
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,441
   No, but I am sure it said    
       the golden reward        

160
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,376
          is for those          
       who serve Toth-Ra.       

161
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,246
      I am serving him...       
        by cleaning up.         

162
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,715
      This place is a mess      
          of treasure.          

163

         I don't know.

       -Maybe we better--       
             -Ooh!              

165
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,587
What's in this                  
weird jar, huh?

Do not look                     
in those jars.                  

168
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,962
         Ooh, a kidney!

170
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,966
We brought that kidney          
from home, I swear!

Sorry. Too much?                

177
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,380
      Isn't there some way      
        you can help us?        

178
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,816
[chuckles] I suppose            
we could just rise up           

179
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,317
against the

                      Do that!  

182
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,223
              Why?              
     We've got food, water,     

183
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,991

 a kind and merciful god-king.  

185
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,796
     What's the outside got     
         that we don't?         

186
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,998
  Toth-Ra has got you working   
         night and day,         

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,967
   but you barely got enough    
         to scrape by.

00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,524

00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,145
Feels like a technicality.      

222
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,313
      As long as you could talk,

223
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,681
                  you could talk
                  your way out. 

224
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,082
          Trademark: Louie Duck.

225
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,150
I don't know,                   
this whole thing                

226
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,885
is a silly mistake.             

227
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,187
  You were stealing treasure.   

228
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,890
            [gasps]             
         I would never!         

229
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,191
   I'm a new pharaoh in town.   

230
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,227
          Maybe you've          
          heard of me?          

231
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,496
            Lou-Rai,            
    master of all pharaohs.     

232
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,164
  Basically, your boss' boss.   

233
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,567
   You should just let us go    
      before I get angry.       

234
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,734
He'll never buy that.           

235
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,437
     Pharaoh of pharaohs, huh?  

236
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,207
There shall be none             
above Toth-Ra!                  

237
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,161
        [both screaming]        

238
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,245
Into the pit                    
of eternal screams.             

239
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,113
         I never thought I'd die
         in a pit of spikes.    

240
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,949
         I mean, I always hoped.

241
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:47,218
  Prepare to scream eternally!  

242
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,453
  Or until you hit the bottom.  

243
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,288
               Wait a second!   
               You can't do that

244
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,924
         because because I have 
         a really good reason...

245
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,125
         and my reason is this--

246
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,794
            Because             
     you've got to perform      

247
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,295
      the proper ceremony first.

248
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,764
        I don't see any         
      mummification tools,      

249
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,199
      no book of the dead.      

250
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,301
          Are you even          
    a certified high priest?    

251
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,869
   Well, no, but I--            

252
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,238
 There has to be a high priest  
         in attendance.         

253
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,274
      Everyone knows that.      

254
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,242
         Wh--                   
         I definitely knew that.

255
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,378
        Just check the scroll   
        if you don't believe us.

256
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,149
             -Bye!              
             -Hey!              

257
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,452
    Wow, that was quick thinking

258
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,220
                on that phony   
                sacrifice stuff.

259
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,555
Oh, that was all real.          

260
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,757
           Wait, you were trying
           to help him kill us? 

261
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,560
If I'm gonna be sacrificed      
I'm gonna do it right.          

262
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:31,162
                  Pretenders,   
                  get back here!

263
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,336
At least my thing helped.       

264
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,571
Every time                      
you ignore the rules            

265
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:42,140
and "pull a Louie",             
we end up in more trouble.      

266
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,308
               Because the rules
               of this place    

267
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,343
         are nonsense like this.

268
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,912
Bird, bird,                     
different bird,                 
snake, leaf.                    

269
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,180
                       Nonsense!

270
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,749
Just because                    
you don't understand it         

271
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,283
doesn't mean it's--             
Huh.                            

272
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,319
Actually,                       
this doesn't make sense.        

273
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,655
             This bird is facing
             the wrong way.     

274
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,358
Secret passage! Yes!            

275
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,664
All right, troops.              

276
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,865
       It won't be easy,        

277
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,366
 but we'll whip you into shape. 

278
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,434
   Defeat that gauze-wrapped    

279
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,802
       reprobate Toth-Ra,       

280
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,171
       and save Louie and Webby.

281
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,940
                   Show 'em what
                   we got, boys!

282
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,510
   [groaning]                   

283

                     Good, good.

284
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,179
                 Work on that   
                 shamble, Horus.

285
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,814
               Nice groan, Seth.

286
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,983
         -What is this?         
    -What's more terrifying     

287
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,018
         than an army of mummies
         limping towards you?   

288
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,721
You realize                     
Toth-Ra is a mummy.             

289
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,656
       [mummies groaning]

        -[Scrooge] Ugh.         

291
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,627
            All right,          
            back to one, people.

292
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,828
                   New strategy.

293
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,031
            What do you know    
            about Frankensteins?

294
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,200
And then we come at Toth-Ra     
from both sides.                

295
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,202
            But what about      
         his laser beam eyes?   

296
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,503
You've seen                     
these laser eyes?               

297
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,839
             No, but he is      
             all-powerful.      

298
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,042
Fine, we cause a diversion      
and sneak around back.          

299
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,977
         But his scarab spies   
     will tell him we're coming.

300
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,579
Since when does he              
have scarab spies?              

301
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,047
         Since whenever he wants

302
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,716
              for he is Toth-Ra,

303
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,517
               the almighty,    
               all-powerful--   

304
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,352
Uh, yeah, yeah,                 
I get it.                       

305
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,589
[whistle shrieks]

            -again.             
   -That's a boy, Launchpad.    

307
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,494
        Good to see             
        you're finally          
        taking things seriously.

308
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,696
          Fill, fold,           
        roll, and tuck.         

309
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,398
     Real burrito fillings      
       are a lot messier        

310
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,666
   than these practice ones.    

311
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,101
          If you can't          
        tuck those ends,        

312
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,402
        how are you ever        
         gonna make it          

313
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,870
          through the           
       combination menu?        

314
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,406
              We're going to die
              down here.        

315
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,375
               Now we just      
               follow this trail
               and we are...    

316
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,879
    -back where we started?     
        -Louie's on it!

   How was your day, darling?

         I missed you.

        [Louie grunting]        

320
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,622
                   Stop touching
                   everything!  

321
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,058
I'm trying to get out           
the way we came in.             

322
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,427
Plus, we get this               
sweet souvenir.                 

323
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,395
Hey, I think I saw              
a skeleton over there.          

324
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,264
            Really?!            
            Uh, no, no. No time.

325
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,932
            The prophecy says   
            we'll be cursed if--

326
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,868
If we cross Toth-Ra,            

327
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,302
but that can                    
mean anything.                  

328
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,138
Besides, the dumb pharaoh       
isn't even here.

333
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,325
             Where are we going?

334
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,161
           [mummies]            
   The Pharaoh's throne room!   

335
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,595
                 And what are we
                 going to do?   

336
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,397

       Anything he asks!        

337
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,933
         No! You're gonna       
         stand up for yourselves

338
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,468
         while I rescue my kids.

339
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,504
          Right, but if we      
          attack Toth-Ra,       

340
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,406
          and he tells us       
           to surrender,        

341
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,741
         we should do that,     
               right?           

342
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:33,111
We've spent our lives           
blindly serving Toth-Ra.        

343
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,513
Now we're trying to change      
our whole way of life           

344
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,783
for the promise of              
a simple bo-rrito.              

345
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,185
     This is not just about

       -a simple burrito.

347
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,655
        It's about all kinds    
            of burritos.

00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,490
      -[mummies cheering]       
         -Wet burritos.

        -[mummies] Yeah!

             Yeah!              

351
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,594
            Some people even put

352
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:50,862
              french fries      
              in their burritos.

353
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,530
 This is the dumbest rebellion  

354
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,098
    I've ever been part of.

       [mummies cheering]       

356
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,371
Great, we crossed Toth-Ra       
by messing with his stuff       

357
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,773
and now we're done for.         

358
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,175
Oh, why do you always           
have to work an angle?          

359
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,945
          -Good idea!           
           -No, wait!

00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:10,348
        Toth-Ra, Pharaoh Lou-Rai
        from next door. Hey!    

361
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,986
         I am Toth-Ra,          
     commander of the sun.      

362
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,288
               Dooh, hate to    
               pull rank, Chief,

363
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,390
          but, uh, I'm commander
          of the whole universe,

364
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:23,995
          which kind of includes
          the sun, so...        

365
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,998
          Impossible.           
     Uh, come forth so that     

366
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,368
        I may smite you,        
        vile pretender!         

367
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,540
          No, you come over here
          so I can smite you.   

368
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,375
             Never!             
       You come over here       

369
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,577
      because I'm going to      
          smite you...          

370
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,212
            so hard.            

371
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,484
            [Toth-Ra]           
            Get away from there!

372
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,586
       Uh, I am ordering        
           that guard           

373
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,590
     to control me with my      
    awesome pharaoh powers.     

374
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,226
           Ah, fine, you got me.

375
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,030
                How is this part
                of the prophecy?

376
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,432
Webby, it's not a prophecy.     
It's a con.                     

377
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,368
How long you been running       
this pyramid scheme?            

378
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,537
       My ancestor was          
       Toth-Ra's personal guard.

379
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,507
  He was supposed to protect him
  till he awakened in here.     

380
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,676
           But he never woke up.

381
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,912
       So to give everyone hope,

382
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,281
            he set up this rig  
            so the pharaoh could

383
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:20,418
 fulfill his promise to bring   
 the people their golden reward.

384
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,021
Wait, the golden reward         
is just the sun?                

385
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,455
That's lame.                    

386
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,925
    And your family decided     
  to keep tricking the people   

387
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,427
     so they'd worship you      
      and do your bidding.      

388
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,129
     Ugh, but the prophecy!     

389
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,465
          -The mummy.           
           -All fake.           

390
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,269
I'd really appreciate it        
if you didn't tell anyone.      

391
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,038
    Aww, don't worry, Webbs.    

392
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,206
    You'll get ripped apart     
   by a real mummy some day.

         [loud banging]

             Pharaoh, Toth-Ra!  

395
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,413
             Your people        
             demand freedom!

00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,617
             But mostly         
             the freedom part.  

398
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,619
         Now release my family! 

399

400

              you dare intrude  
              upon the pharaoh?!

       the guard has crossed me.

403
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,164
                  Take him away!

404
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,433
             Whoa!              

405
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,834
Hey-a, Mr. McDuck.

              Where's Louie?

             Be free, my people!

                Ooh, and pack up
                the treasure.   

410
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,577
           It is prophesied     
           that you will one day

411
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,514
    give it to a young, handsome
    duck dressed all in green.

           Never mind.          
           I found him.         

413
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,518
          Or just give it to me.

     charming, young man myself.

   you towering tattie bogle!   

445
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,451
           [Scrooge]            
   Let my children go-- aah!    

446
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,219
           -Mr. McD!            
         -[both grunt]

00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,796
       [Louie whimpering]       
             Help!              

451
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,535
       I'm coming, Louie!       

452
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,736
              Hmm.              

453
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,271
   Huey, Dewey,                 
   stay here.                   

454
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,607
       Launchpad,               
       Launchpad?               

455
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,609
            No, Launchpad.      

456
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,544
       -[mummies gasping]       
          -Is he okay?          

457
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,879
        Don't lose hope.        

458
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,547
     Remember the burritos.     

459
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,616
   When a burrito falls apart   
           you got to           

460
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,752
        put it in a bowl        
    and eat it with a fork.     

461
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,922
          Or, uh, grab          
      some tortilla chips       

462
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,824
   and make nachos, I guess.    

463
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,893
       Uh, is any of this       
         making sense?          

464
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,095
             This was never     
             about burritos.    

465
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,465
      -It wasn't?               
      -It's about freedom       
      to make a choice.         

466
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,401
            A choice bigger than
            beef or veggies.    

467
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,769
                 We've lived    
                 our whole lives

468
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,105
          toiling in the service
          of the pharaoh.       

469
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,508
            Now we get to choose
            for ourselves.      

470
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,942
            And what do we want?

471
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,844
             [all]              
           Burritos!            

472
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,312
    Wow. Okay, then.            

473
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,847
       Charge!                  

474
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,160
         I think we got off     
         on the wrong foot here.

475
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,529
              I could help you, 
              you know,         
              with a little buzz

476
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,430
             and some facetime  
             at the right crypts

477
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,499
           I could make you     
           bigger than Tut, man!

478
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,602
     Aah! Would you believe     
   that this is all a dream?    

479
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:32,770

480
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:33,871
             Fine!              

481
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,273
  Look, I'm just a scared kid   

482
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,774
       who talked himself       
         into a problem         

483
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,176
         that he can't          
       get out of, okay?        

484
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,677
     No more rule bending.      

485
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,712
  Let's just do this your way.  

486
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,381
   I am your humble servant.    

487
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,850
     What can I do for you,     
       almighty Toth-Ra?        

488
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,688
              Die.              

489
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,590
           -Oh, man.            
        -[Webby] Louie!         

490
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,194
If we can get him               
back across the seal            

491
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,796
maybe he'll stop trying         
to destroy everyone.            

492
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,698
            How are we gonna get
            a ten-foot mummy    

493
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,899
           back across the seal?

494
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,468
    By offering him             
    a golden reward!            

495
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:09,740
             -Huh?              
            -[gasps]

00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,746
           [Scrooge]            
Just like Launchpad taught you. 

497
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,949
  Fill, fold, roll, and tuck!   

498
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,820
       [Toth-Ra growling]       

499
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,591
   That's the biggest burrito   
        I've ever seen.         

500
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,630
       [Toth-Ra growling]       

501
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,337
   Aah! The sun god is angry!   

502
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,172
     Everyone back inside!      

503
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,243
   Oh... [chuckles]             
   Never mind.                  

504
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,778
       So, what are you gonna do
       now you're free?         

505
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,085
  We'll take 100 quesadillas,   

506
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,753
          55 tostadas,          

507
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,623
  and 200 burrito<i> especiales,</i>   
            please.             

508
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,727
Oh, well, this is embarrassing. 

509
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,562
This one's on me.               

510
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,197
            That will be $9,000.

511
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,432
           -My money.           
     -Aww, thanks, Mr. McD.     

512
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,700
           I'll get you back.   

513
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,636
         Then we found          
        a secret tunnel.        

514
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,204
         Then we awoke          
       the cursed mummy.        

515
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,973
 And then we almost died again. 

516
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:19,777
Hey, Webby, thanks              
for saving my life              
a bunch back there.             

517
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,312
I'll try to listen              
to you next time                

518
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:24,048
and not, you know,              
"pull a Louie."                 

519
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,650
               Seriously, that's
               a thing now?     

520
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:26,984
It's all about branding.        

521
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,454
Launchpad, bringer              
of the bo-rrito,                

522
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,324
as thanks                       
we bestow upon ye

the golden khopesh              
of Toth-Ra.                     

524
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,428
            Hey, thanks!

as thanks for helping us        
see the light-- pun intended,

529
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,916
         Mm, you know,          

530
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,252
        this is actually        
        not bad at all.         

531
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:04,488
