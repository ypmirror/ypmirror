Huey, don't touch the stove. It's hot!

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,100
What if the boat goes down while the babysitter's here?

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,630
BOTH: Yes, Uncle Donald.

28

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,110
I didn't give you a new address.

Crazy old bird.

36

Where can I find another babysitter at ten o' clock?

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,250
Ten o' clock!

38
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,120
You gotta go!

39
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,030
Aah!

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,120
I can't just leave you!

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,530
We can survive for a couple of hours!

42
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,370
A couple of hours. Uh... well, okay.

43
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,970

Where's Dewey?

46
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,770
Sleeping.

47
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,350
Who's Dewey?

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,890
"Who's Dewey?"

49
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,990
All right, boys, we'll get to Cape Suzette and back before anyone realizes we're gone.

50
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,110
So long, Dorkburg! Hello...

51
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,730
Uncle Donald?

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,980
What-- What's up?

53
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,150
I can't leave you boys alone for one minute!

54
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,280
You were supposed to get him out by ten o' clock, Hubert!

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,130
You were supposed to signal before you started the boat, Dewford!

56
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,830
We never get to do anything!

57
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,640
Boys, if we want to keep our home afloat...

58
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,540
(sigh)

59
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,990
We've all got to do things we don't want to do.

McDuck Manor? As in Scrooge McDuck?

63
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,780
The bajillionaire?

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,190
You're finally gonna sell us.

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,650
I'm not gonna sell--

66
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,520
*sigh*

67
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,020
He owes me.

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,040
We're gonna meet Scrooge McDuck?

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,630
That guy's amazing!

70
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,000
What!
That guy's amazing!

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,050
What!

72
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,790
I heard he's so epic he defeated a rock giant and carved a statue of himself out of its leg!

73
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,840
I heard he's so smart he solved the mystery of the Chupacabra.

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,510
Turns out it was just a shaved bear!

75
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:07,190
I heard that he's so rich he only hunts for treasure to swim in it!

76
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,910
All right, take it down a notch.

77
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,960
It's only a couple of hours.

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,020
A couple of hours with the most exciting duck in the world!

79
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:27,070
With business expanding in the Spoonerville and St. Canard markets, noted in Appendices C, G and 5F, we're also cutting funding to unnecessary departments:

80
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,170
Historical Research, Experimental Tech, Deep Sea Exploration...

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,960
Fantastic.

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,550
Back in the bin with ya.

83
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,750
See you tomorrow. (sighs)

84
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,570

89
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,990
(laughs) Been there.

90
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,650
I don't have an office, per say,

91
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,320
but in some ways the road is my office.

92
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,030
Hey, that's deep. I gotta write that down.

93
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,910

94
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,390

95
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,790
Every dent is coming out of your salary.

96
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,390
Absolutely.

97
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,270
Hey, ya read about that crazy snowstorm on the Drake Barrier Reef?

98
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,520
I'd hate to fly into that one.

99
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,140
See, I'm a bit of a pilot, and, uh-- Oh, okay.

100
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,480
Divider-- there you go.

101
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,980
(crash)

102
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,390
Hit the brakes!

103
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,680
(tires squealing)

104
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,950
Ech.

105
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,290
Why aren't we moving?

106
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,390
Mrs. B., open up!

107
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,740
I need to get out of here before--

108

Donald Duck.

Uncle Scrooge.

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,650
Uncle Scrooge!

115
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,460
Ah!

116
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,960
So, you're looking good.

117
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,090
Still living on that boat?

118
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,090
Yup. Still a trillionaire?

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,240
(bird calls)

120
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,590
Good, good.

121
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,770
So...

122
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,490
So...

123
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:41,100
Jettison that jalopy from my driveway this instant, you deadbeat!

124
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,390
Oh, here we go!

125
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,470
Giving orders like he's the richest duck in the world!

126
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,710
I am the richest duck in the world!

127
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,380
Now move!

128
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,680
I would love to!

129
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,170
It just so happens I have a job interview.

130
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,020
So why are you standing there yelling?

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,660
Mrs. B. said you would watch the boys!

132
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,380
Can you do that without losing them?!

133
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,580
Of course I can!

134
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,410
Fantastic!

135
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,060
Thank you <i>so</i> much!

136
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,350
You're welcome!

137

Wait, what now?

138
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,230
(car door slams)

139
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,670
Huey, Dewey, Louie, meet Scrooge McDuck.

140
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,170
Remember, no tricks, no lies, no trouble.

141
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,220
ALL: Yes, Uncle Donald.

142
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,570
I wasn't talking to <i>you</i>.

143
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,320
Whoa!

144
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,820
Talk to your nephews.

145
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,730
Ew.

147
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,900
So, do children still like marbles or...?

148
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,060
Are you really our uncle?

149
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,030
How old are you?

150
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,770
What's your net worth?

151
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:57,970
What's the deal with you and Uncle Donald?
What's your net worth?

What's the deal with you and Uncle Donald?

Ooh, Is that fork real silver? Can I have it?

'Cause you're so old and moving is so hard?

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,030
the third one...

171
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,300
Please do not leave the designated play area.

172
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,860
(clinks)

173
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,730
A gift from your great-uncle.

174
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,610
You will return them upon your departure.

175
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,880
He's counted them.

176
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,770
(lock clicks)

177
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,500
Great. Now we've got two boring uncles.

178
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,430
So, we're totally ditching this room, right?

179
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,630
Yup, and I know just how to do it.

180
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,560
(gasps)

181
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,710
(grumbling)

182
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,910
"Used to be a big deal".

183
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,440
(beating)

184
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,650
Stupid doorknob, come off!

185
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,180
Nailed it!

186
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,290
Can't believe that was your best plan.

187
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,700
Come on, guys!

188
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,500
Let's go touch some expensive stuff.

189
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,880
Woaah!

190
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,840
Dewey!

191
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,690
BOTH: Aah!

192
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,390
I'll put the marbles back, I swear!

193
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,460
Who sent you?

194
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,310
Ma Beagle? Glomgold?

195
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,870
Answer me!

196
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,140
(sobbing) U-Uncle Scrooge!

197
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,600
Uncle Scrooge?

198
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,520
Oh my gosh, the nephews!

199
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,110
Wait, you know us?

200
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:31,930
(grunting)

201
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,240
Of course! Researching Mr. McDuck and his family is kind of my hobby.

202
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:36,820
What?

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,420
What are your blood types?

204
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,540
What's Donald really like?

205
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,530
Who's the evil triplet?

206
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,090
Louie.

207
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,560
Eh.

208
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,330
Tell me everything!

209
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,950
Um, we live with our uncle?

210
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,990
On a boat?

211
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,590
Go on.

212
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,520
Kinda it.

213
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,640
We're just a normal, boring family.

214
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,940
Normal, boring? Hah!

215
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,220
ALL: Ohh!

216
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,370
Whoa!

217
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,150
Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck,

218
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,640
Scrooge McDuck's great-nephews on his sister Hortense's side

219
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,360
with Quackmore Duck twice removed!

220
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,010
And you are?

221
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,110
Oh, right.

222
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,210
Webby Vanderquack.

223
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,570
My granny's the housekeeper.

224
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,720
Wait! Are we... friends now?

225
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,280
If we say yes, will you let us live?

226
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,320
(scoffs) Good one, new best friend!

227
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,500
So, friend, what do you do for fun around here?

228
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,260
Oh! I'm the best at fun.

229
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,020
Um...

230
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,160
Yeah!

231
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,040
At least it's not the marble room.

232
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,120
(grunting)

233
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,570
Come on, you blaggert.

234
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,180
You won't get the best of Scrooge McDuck!

235
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,310
Hmm. A little spring cleaning?

236
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,900
Maybe. Maybe not.

237
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,580
Read this.

238
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,120
Snow. On the Drake Barrier Reef.

239
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,050
First time in 50 years.

240
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,180
That weather report aligns perfectly with the Papia Prophecy.

241
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,640
A shift in currents may present a pathway to...

242
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,140
Atlantis, lost city under the sea!

243
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,420
This is because some children made fun of you, isn't it?

244
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,960
Nonsense!

245
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,200
I'm no has-been. They're the has-beens.

246
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,940
I am an am-now.

247
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,900
Make a list!

248
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,440
Four oxygen tanks,

249
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,260
two pressure gauges, a pilot-

250
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,220
I'm a pilot.

251
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,110
...a week's provisions,

252
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,860
an experimental deep-sea sub...

253
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,470
I'm a pilot.

254
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,320
And one secretary, for an old man who seems to have forgotten that I, am not, his secretary!

255
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,340
So, eh, not interested?

256
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,060
I have enough excitement caring for Webby.

257
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,730
Perhaps you should spend some time with your family.

258
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:47,500
Oh I, hang up my spats, become the dottering old relic everyone thinks I am, spinning yarns to those loud-mouth young'uns about the man I used to be?

259
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,550
You have avoided them for ten years!

260
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,380
Because family is nothing but <i>trouble!</i>

261
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,400
(gasps) Oh.

262
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm Scrooge McDuck.

263
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,820
I made my name being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.

264
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:12,440
And I made my money square, on my own, no nephews, no family, no one helped me there, and I don't need help now, and--

265
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,770
(clattering)

266
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,900
Beakley, a little help.

267
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,980
Maybe they're right.

268
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,410
Whoo! Vent crawl!

269
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:26,800
Woah!

270
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,650
You don't get out much, do you?

271
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,960
Eh, Granny's a bit overprotective.

272
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,950
She trains me to be ready for anything, but

273
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,400
then she says I've got everything I need in here.

274
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,160
But one day, I'm gonna see the world.

275
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,260
I'm gonna be an explorer!

276
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,420
I'm gonna eat a hamburger.

277
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,030
We could bring you a hamburger.

278
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,180
You really are my best friends.

279
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,870
Welcome to the Wing of Secrets!

280
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,280
I knew it!

281
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,490
Dewey, check it out!

282
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,110
Yeah, whatever.

283
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,260
The Gong of Pixiu.

284
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,810
Hit it three times to unleash unspeakable evil.

285
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,720
Uh, what are you doing?

286
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,830
Calling dibs on stuff!

287
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,530
What? Scrooge is like, he's like super old.

288
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,890
Oh, careful! Medusa gauntlet.

289
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,880
One touch can turn organic matter to stone.

290
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,110
(imitates solidifying)

291
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,250
Okay, we'll call this one a maybe.

292
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,580
This place is incredible!

293
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,590
It's fake.

294
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,360
Is that Uncle Donald?

295
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,630
Oh yeah, he was Mr. McDuck's sidekick!

296
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,730
Dewey's right.

297
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,760
Totally fake.

298
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,960
Uncle Donald has never done anything cool.

299
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,000
What? Donald Duck is one of the most daring adventurers of all time!

300
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,040
(humming)

301
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,700
(phone rings)

302
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,380
(shine)

303
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,520
Bo bop.

304
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,480
Bop.

305
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,550
Yo, chung chung!

306
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,300
Bo bop!

307
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,000
Bo bop. Bo bop! Bo bop! Bo bop! Bo bop!

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,350
(angrish)

309
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,300
(yelling)

310
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,740
This has got to be a fake.

311
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,670
And I bet everything else is too.

312
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,290
That's not true!

313
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,530
What about this picture with Chupacabra?

314
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,290
Photoshop.

315
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,510
Well, this treasure chest?

316
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,510
Probably bought it at an auction.

317
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,410
This... g-ghost?

318
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,650
You mean this Halloween decoration?

319
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,640
Curse ye, ye scurvy life-lubbers!

320
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,280
It's Captain Peghook, the scourge of the River Styx!

321
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,930
It's real. It's really, really real!

322
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,090
Woaha ha ha ha ha!

323
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,990
The Deus Excalibur!

324
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,400
It won't rest until its target's slain!

325
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,980
But he's already dead!

326
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,710
(gong rings)

327
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,370
(gasps) Do not let anything else hit that gong!

328
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Yep, I'm gonna sit this one out.

329
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,580
Whoa, whohoa! Aah, gaah!
Yep, I'm gonna sit this one out.

330
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:10,740
Whoa, whohoa! Aah, gaah!

331
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,650
(whinnies)
Whoa, whohoa! Aah, gaah!

332
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,300
Whoa, whohoa! Aah, gaah!

333
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,480
(exclaims)

334
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,790
The headless man-horse!

335
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,420
That one feels self-explanatory.

336
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,660
(rings)

337
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,550
That's twice!

338
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,020
One more, and something terrible could happen!

339
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,980
What could be worse than this?

340
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,640
What in dismal downs is going on in here?

341
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,600
ALL: There it is.

342
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,180
Why aren't you in your rooms?

343
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,420
(screaming)

344
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,550
Rrrawgh!

345
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,940
Aah!

346
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,640
Ha ha ha ha ha!

347
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,690
(grunts)

348
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,150
(neighs)

349
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,650
We've got this.

350
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,420
There are four of us and three of them.

351
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,490
If we-- wait, never mind. They teamed up.

352
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,750
Wrhu ha ha! Ha ha ha!

353
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,490
Ah, good, that means only one target.

354
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,420
No, get back! You're old!

355
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,270
Oi, beastie! What's it gonna take to shuffle you off to the afterlife?

356
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,770
The head of Scrooge McDuck!

357
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,190
(cracking)

358
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,440
Would you settle for his hat?

359
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
(roaring)

360
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,530
(groans)

361
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,570
(blade rings)

362
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,220
There's your head.

363
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,940
I should've been more specific!

364
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,540
(whinnies)

365
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,560
What!

366
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,130
Ha ha!

367
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,680
What!

368
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,800
And then your head!

369
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,480
Boom!

370
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:47,510
(pounds)
Boom!

371
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,090
(pounds)

372
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,550
We can explain.

373
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,310
We came down to your secret museum to look for you, because we love you?

374
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,430
Secret museum?

375
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,950
This is the gar-age!

376
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,720
The what?

377
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,980
Do you mean "garage"?

378
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,170
No, that's ridiculous.

379
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,640
If this is a garage, then how do you explain all this amazing stuff?

380
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,570
Like the garden hose of destiny?

381
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,730
Or Montezuma's stack of old magazines?

382
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,070
Or-- Oh, yeah, it's a garage.

383
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,410
Unbelievable. I invite you into my home--

384
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,250
You locked us in a room!

385
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,670
I gave you marbles!

386
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,250
All we wanted was to hang out with you!

387
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,970
Well, now you have, and look at the mess it's got me!

388
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,750
I guess family is nothing but <i>trouble, right, Scrooge?</i>

389
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,850
Everybody out!

390
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,780
But we're--

391
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,220
Out!

392
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,730
(gasp)

393
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,410
Oh, what are you gaping at?

394
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,310
The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and--

395
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,170
And- And you already hit it two times, didn't you?

396
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,530
(crackling)

397
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,630
(roar)

398
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,550
Pixiu, the Gold-Hunting Dragon...

399
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,410
Gold hunting? Sounds great!

400
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,920
Not when you're Duckburg's single largest owner of gold!

401
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,350
(sniffing)

402
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,290
Aah! Me money bin!

403
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,720
To your rooms!

404
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,670
Where are you going?

405
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,470
I'm gonna go eat a hamburger!

406
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,140
We're in!

407
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,040
Cool.

408
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,860
To be clear, I'm gonna go catch the dragon.

409
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,870
The hamburger was a metaphor from before.

410
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,280
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it. We get it.

411
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,850
But how are we gonna get up there?

412
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,320
(gasp)

413
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,030
I'm a pilot.

414
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,030
(growl)

415
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,210
(roar)

416
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,390
Ooh! Yeah! Ha ha!

417
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:52,380
It'll take more than some fancy flying to shake old Scrooge, you cash cannibal! Whoo!

418
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh! Arrghs! Ugh!

419
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:04,100
It'll take more than a bruised spine to shake old Scrooge, you bad dragon-dog!

420
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,420
Take that!

421
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,650
No!

422
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,160
(straining)

423
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,530
Whoo-hoo!

424
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,600
I thought I told you to go to your--

425
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,450
No time. We gotta work fast.

426
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,000
Webby, how do we stop it?

427
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,380
It's mystical, so we need a mystical device, like an oblivion mirror or a medusa gauntlet, or--

428
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,270
Like this?

429
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,550
Grr.

430
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,320
What? I was gonna give it back.

431
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,720
Now, how do we get him down there?

432
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,900
Garden hose of destiny!

433
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,370
Launchpad, we need to swing him out.

434
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,930
Nosedive towards the bin and get ready to pull up!

435
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,650
Yes, sir, random kid I just met!

436
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,080
Any questions?

437
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,300
Since when is Launchpad a pilot?

438
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,740
(clinks)

439
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,440
(roar)

440
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,810
You guys, our family is awesome!

441
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,010
ALL: Scrooge!

442
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,460
(gasping)

443
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,800
Yeah!

444
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,770
He swims in money! I knew it!

445
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,680
Aw. Family truly is the greatest adventure of--

446
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,950
Oh, no, the ground!

447
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,050
(crashing)

448
00:19:51,460 --> 00:20:00,300
In the short time I've known you, you've wrecked my home and my money bin, unleashed several ancient evils, and almost gotten me killed. Twice!

449
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,170
Four times if you count each monster as an individual time...

450
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:03,930
(gasp)

451
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,490
Hu hu hu ha ha ha ha!

452
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,580
Ha ha ha ha haha ha ha!

453
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,270
That was incredible!

454
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,230
When you pulled me into the airplane and said "No time!"

455
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,810
Ah! And who would have thought of a Medusa Gauntlet?! Brilliant!

456
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,410
Oh, and then you swung me out and pulled up just in time and- *ho ho ha*

457
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,990
You kids are nothing but <i>trouble!</i>

458
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,890
Curse me kilts, have I missed <i>trouble!</i>

459
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:35,670
I suppose I'll have to keep an eye on you to teach you how to get into trouble properly.

460
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,130
(phone ringing)
I suppose I'll have to keep an eye on you to teach you how to get into trouble properly.

461
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,670
(phone ringing)

462
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,030
You mean--?

463
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,700
Beakley! Clear my schedule!

464
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,790
I'm taking the wee ones on a field trip.

465
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,910
About time. And once again, I am not your secre--

466
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,580
Now, let's go find the lost city of Atlantis!

467
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,140
ALL: Yeah!

468
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,060
And no one tell your Uncle Donald!

469
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,190
ALL: Yeah!

470
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,740
Who is that?

471
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,720
(struggling)

472
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,590
You've got the job, Duck!

473
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,820
Seriously?

474
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,130
Oh, boy!

475
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,240
I'm a real accountant!

476
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,410
Accountant? That was filled yesterday.

477
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,500
You're our new sailor!

478
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,970

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,150
Take an idea.

504
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,890
Make it your own.

505
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,200
Better, faster, cheaper.

506
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,210
That's the motto of the world's most beloved Scottish billionaire duck!

507
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,460
Flintheart Glomgold!

508
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:49,640
Welcome, new employees, to Glomgold Industries, where our employees are the greatest treasure of all!

509
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,930
(clapping)

510
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,180
Glomgold! Glomgold!

511
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,610
Glom-- Fine.

512
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,870
Enough glad-handing.

513
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,840
You're here because you're the best of the cheapest.

514
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:14,580
With your help, and my carefully crafted master plan, we'll find the fabled lost Jewel of Atlantis and finally make me the richest duck in the world!

515
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,370
Wuh ha ha ha ha!

516
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,660
But first, here are your company IDs, also good for 40% off life vest rental in case of emergency.

517
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,560
Gabby McStabberson.

518
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,930
Hack and Slash Smashkinov.

519
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,100
Donald Duck.

520
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,450
Duck?

521
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,590
Duck?!

522
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,720
Hehe! Now remember, bedtime is at nine.

523
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,430
And no sugar after seven. Oh, and--

524
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,090
I run a multi-trillion dollar business.

525
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,160
I can handle a few juveniles for the weekend.

526
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,320
You just focus on this new job of yours.

527
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,340
Besides, we've got a pretty low-key day planned.

528
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,990
Hoist the mainsail!

529
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,270
Other boat words, to Atlantis! Dive! Dive!

530
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:54,780
No, wait!
Other boat words, to Atlantis! Dive! Dive!

531
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,240
No, wait!

532
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,300
Aye aye!

533
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,030
Launchpad, the hatch. Stop the--

534
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,420
Whoo-hoo!

535
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,540
Talk to your uncle.

536
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,840
Hey, Uncle Donald.

537
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,730
Nope, yeah, pretty boring.

538
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,460
We napped, rubbed ointment on our joints, old people stuff.

539
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,350
Oh, no what, what about the dragon?

540
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,320
And the plane crash?

541
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,610
And-

542
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,040
Whoops, three pm. Time for dinner. Bye!

543
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,550
Wh-Why didn't you tell him the truth?

544
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,870
You didn't tell your grandma we were going to a dangerous underwater city, did you?

545
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,280
I kinda sorta... didn't tell her anything?

546
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,670
Webby, that's irresponsible!

547
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,940
She'll be worried sick!

548
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,540
Call your grandma this instant and tell her that you are spending the night at a friend's house, okay?

549
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,510
Lying: it's the responsible thing to do.

550
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,180
Launchpad, have you ever piloted a sub before?

551
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,660
I sunk a helicopter in a wave pool once.

552
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,310
Same thing?

553
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,920
Eh, I've done more with less.

554
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,680
No matter, I'm back! Unchartered territory.

555
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,550
Bold new discoveries!

556
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:01,810
Hello, bingo!
Bold new discoveries!

557
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,730
Hello, bingo!

558
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,810
I love road trips!

559
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,270
I've got snacks, a playlist of traditional sea shanties, matching family road trip shirts!

560
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,710
Yeah, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but there's no time.

561
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,660
Eh- But according to the travel itinerary--

562
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,990
Boo!

563
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,330
Adventure isn't about planning, it's about doing!

564
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,620
So, what can I be in charge of?

565
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,530
The buzzsaw arms?

566
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,000
No!

567
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,470
Sonic cannons?

568
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,690
What? No!
Sonic cannons?

569
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,300
What? No!

570
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,560
Hyper-dense zero-point energy missiles to pierce the scaly hide of a Kraken?!

571
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,860
None of those things are real things!

572
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:36,990
This is your first expedition, so just stand back and watch an old pro from a safe distance.

573
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,130
So what is this submarine equipped with?

574
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,570
(whirs)

575
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,770
Seatbelts.

576
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,240
(laughing)

577
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,870
Ha! Good one.

578
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,340
Classic Scrooge-Dewey banter, the seasoned-but-tired explorer passing the torch to his cocky young successor.

579
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,070
I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually know our names.

580
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,580
I'm sorry, what?

581
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,860
I think he called me Herbet once.

582
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,410
Don't be ridiculous!

583
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,890
Hey, Scrooge! When are we gonna set sail, Scrooge?

584
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,740
In a moment, Sonny Jim.

585
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,690
I will cram it down your throat.

586
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,230
Guys, lighten up! We're on a deep-sea expedition, with Scrooge McDuck!

587
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,740
Mr. McQuack, chart a course.

588
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,760
Next stop, the lost City of Atlantis!

589
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,680
Who hoo!

590
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,280
In about sixteen hours!

591
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,080

Driving, right?

601
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,810
Hey, Scrooge, First Mate Dewey here.

602
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,310
Your map's got us going the long way.

603
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,620
I can probably find a shortcut if you just let me--

604
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,270
Uh-uh, lad.
I can probably find a shortcut if you just let me--

Uh-uh, lad.

606
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,840
The shortest distance between two points isn't always a straight line.

607
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,340
Okay, but, yes, it is, so if you just go--

608
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,490
(snoring)

609
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,450

Hm?

612
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,130
Shortcut achieved!

613
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,170
He'll thank me later.

614
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,790

Oh, you kids'll be the death of me.

618
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,210
Dewey! Dewey will be the death of you!

619
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,610
Can we make a pit stop?

620
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,080
I have to use the bathroom, but it's, um...

621
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,500
Occupied?

622
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,860
For the love of-- It's the middle of the ocean!

623
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,640
There are no pit stops.

624
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,890
How 'bout that conspicuously unmarked tanker?

625
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,650
Aww, little Dewey's first steps.

626
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,030
And that's Huey in the playoffs.

627
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,730
He was the waterboy.

628
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,220
Oh, look! That's us climbing the Grand Canyon...

629
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,040
display at the supermarket. Ah...

630
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,880
Ah, I miss them so much, but we need this job.

631
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,380
So, tell me about your family.

632
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,890
I was raised by warrior monks who spoke only the language of the blade.

633

636
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,220
We've got intruders!

637
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,690
Scrooge?! What is he doing here?

638
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,440
Strange weather patterns in a mysterious location near treasure. Ha ha!

639
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,610
I knew he couldn't resist!

640
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,530
Hack, triangulate their sub's course!

641
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,870
We'll tail Scrooge and steal the jewel out from under him!

642
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,210
Ha ha!

643
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,850
The boys?!

644
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,890
When I get my hands on--

645
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,200
(angrish)

646
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,850
I'm gonna kill him!

647
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,840
Ooh, better idea!

648
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,130
Nab the jewel and kill them all!

649
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,280
Somebody's angling for employee of the month.

(music of epic wondrousness)

667
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,740
Yes, good. Atlantis.
(music of epic wondrousness)

668
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,850
Yes, good. Atlantis.

669
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,450
"Ooh! Aah!"

670
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,870
Thanks for spoiling the moment.

671
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,280
The whole place is upside-down!

672
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Huh, well, that's a new one.

673
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,960
Whoa!

674
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,530
Just call your grandma already! It's no big deal.

675
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:06,780
(dialing)
Just call your grandma already! It's no big deal.

676
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,330
(dialing)

677
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,410
Uhuh!

678
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,250
Remember, you're at a friend's house, okay?

679
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,510
You got this.

680
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,600
(rapidly) Hi, Granny, I'm spending the night at a friend's house so nothing is wrong!

681
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,580
Oh, you don't got this.

682
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:30,730
Ah-ha! Well, according to these markings, the Atlantines were so eager to build an epic city of wonders and death traps, they didn't stop to figure out a proper support structure, and the whole thing fell into the sea!

683
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,020
You kids best stay by the sub while I scout ahead.

684
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,830
Dewey ran in as soon as you said "death traps".

685
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,430
Come on, Scrooge! We got this.

686
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,400
Boy! (sighs, mutters)

687
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,220
(blade rings)

688
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,700
(squawks)

689
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,280
Oopsie!

690
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,000
(grunts)

691
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:50,800
Hmm?

692
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,740
Meh.

693
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,980
You made me miss!

694
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:03,170
Uh... if we get rid of them now, we can't torture them later!

695
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:10,030
Brilliant! I want Scrooge alive when I shove the Jewel of Atlantis in his smug face!

696
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:16,810
He thinks he is so rich and so Scottish, but I'm wearing a kilt, McDuck, a kilt!

697
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,990
Gah! Lad!

698
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,480
I thought the traps would get you for sure!

699
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,110
(whirring)

700
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,150
Stupid upside-down temple!

701
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,480
Nothing cool about walking <i>under</i> buzzsaws!

702
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,830
From now on, don't touch anything!

703
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,990
(grunts)

704
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,010
(screaming)

705
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,600
(cracks spine)

706
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,540
Maybe Atlantis was an ambitious first outing.

707
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,360
(ringing)

708
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:53,500
(grunting)
(ringing)

709
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:53,670
(grunting)

710
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,380
Hi again, Granny!

711
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,110
Still at a friend's house.

712
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,570
Uh, her name? Sub... ina!

713
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,890
A totally real name for a definitely real person!

714
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,110
(beep)

715
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,920
Uh, good try.

716
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,490
(grunts)

717
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,520
Launchpad, are you okay?

718
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,840
(mumbling)

719
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,530
Ah, a little snake venom never... (gibbering)

720
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,300
Hi, nice to meet you!

721
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,540
I'm everybody's friend!

722
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,230
(thud)

723
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,350
(screaming)
(thud)

724
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,250
(screaming)

725
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,160
Um, I've got to go to the bathroom.

726
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,250
I'll be right back!

727
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,980
(groaning)

728
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,170
(grunts)

729
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,300
Whoa!

730
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,450
Suspension bridge? Chasm? Glowing blue mystical lasers?

731
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,290
Classic!

732
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,790
(muttering) ...Scrooge. Wait till I get my hands on him.

733
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,960
Even a basic death trap still has the word "death" in the title.

734
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,380
(squawking)

735
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,170
Oh, no.

736
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,610
We'll find another route.

737
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,600
It's not safe for amateur adventurers.

738
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,710
That sounds like a challenge!

739
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,380
I have to stress that is not a challenge.

740
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,830
...is exactly what you say to dissuade the weak of heart from accepting the challenge!

741
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,230
Well, challenge accepted!

742
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,420
There is no challenge!
Well, challenge accepted!

743
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,930
There is no challenge!

744
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,970

00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,300
Sure, if you want to do it the easy way.

760
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,840
Why wouldn't you want to do it the easy way?

761
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,750
You've got to work smarter, lad, not harder.

762
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:01,770
Aah!
You've got to work smarter, lad, not harder.

763
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,980
Aah!

764
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,470
Ugh, "lad".

765
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,150
I don't call you "old man" or "Scotty McTophat".

766
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,470
Respect your elder.

767
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,170
When you adventure with Scrooge McDuck--

768
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,300
But I'm not.

769
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,110
You want me to adventure <i>behind</i> Scrooge McDuck, or wait by the sub!

770
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,280
I might as well be back on the houseboat!

771
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,790
Because you have no idea what you're doing!

772
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,760
So show me!

773
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,290
Gimme a chance instead of lumping us all together in the back seat while you drive!

774
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,150
I'm not lumping you all together.

775
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,130
Oh, really?

776
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,420
Which triplet am I?

777
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,920
It's... Bluey?

778
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,170
Aah! Ow!

779
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,520
Ugh! Fantastic.

780
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,040
You see what I'm talking about?

781
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,960
You four find another way 'round!

782
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,980
We're going to... push onward, apparently.

783
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,020
(grunting)

784
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,620
(sighs)

785
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,160
Why, this is no bathroom!

786
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,050
This shortcut leads right to the treasure chamber!

787
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,340
I don't even know why I hired the rest of you!

788
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,470
Help him up!

789
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,080
Ow. Ouch! Owie! Owie!

790
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,220
Maybe I could just hire some family.

791
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,010
Then they'd have to listen to me.

792
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,990
(laughs) There she is, the Jewel of Atlantis!

793
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,980
(cackling)

794
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,940
Who's that?

795
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:41,700
Flintheart Glomgold, the poor man's version of me, which, to be fair, still makes him insanely rich.

796
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,700
(cackling)

797
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,780
Load up the sub.

798
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,660
(gasp)

799
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,780
They've got Uncle Donald?

800
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,380
What?

801
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,780
Let go of my uncle!

802
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,960
No.

803
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,630
I wasn't prepared for that.

804
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,010
What are you doing here, Flinty?

805
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,010
What are you doing here, Scrooge?

806
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,240
I told you to keep the boys safe!

807
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,040
Ah, they're perfectly fine.

808
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,070
Oh, yeah? Where are the other two?

809
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,270
Back safe in the room with the fire and the snakes.

810
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,270
What?

811
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,020
Ah, Scroogy.

812
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,140
I see you know my newest employee.

813
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,410
Your new job is with my sworn enemy?

814
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,830
I can't keep track of all your sworn enemies!

815
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:30,830
Now, now, Donald has been a model employee, and an excellent prisoner.

816
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,860
Yeah! Wait, what?

817
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,940
Hiring my own nephew in order to use him against me?

818
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,630
Now, that is good planning.

819
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,110
Have fun being the second richest duck in the world...

820
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,860
...for the next five minutes.

821
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,910
(cackling)

822
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,450
I'd like to point out that this trap was not my fault.

823
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,920
Junior Woodchuck Rule 841:

824
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,820
There's always another way around.

825
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,850
Hup!

826
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,120
(ringing)

827
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,430
Hup!
(ringing)

828
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:11,730
(ringing)

829
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,440
Oh, no, no, no, no!
(ringing)

830
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,070
Oh, look! Uncle Hampus is here, and he only speaks Swedish.
Oh, no, no, no, no!

831
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,160
Oh, look! Uncle Hampus is here, and he only speaks Swedish.

832
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,350
We don't want to be rude, so... good-bye?

833
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,900
And you're done.

834
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,960
Yeah, you're never gonna be able to back up that lie.

835
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,890
That was crazy!

836
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,170
Whoa!
That was crazy!

837
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,400
Whoa!

838
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,910
Oh,<i> hej,</i> Beakley!

839
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,100
Subina... (speaking Swedish)

840
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,680
(Glomgold cackling)

841
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,220
Take 'em down!

842
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:34,990
Oj då.

843
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,450
We gotta stop the water!

844
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,630
(quacking)

845
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,890
Oh, no.

846
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,340
(sighs)

847
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,530
I knew it!

848
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,970
I knew I couldn't trust you with the boys!

849
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,300
Not the time, Donald.

850
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,570
Crazy old man!

851
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,170
All you care about is your next adventure.

852
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,180
This is the Spear of Selene all over again!

853
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,550
I was NOT responsible for the Spear of Selene!

854
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:15,490
Stop! Scrooge was trying to keep me out of trouble, but I was so caught up in--

855
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,920
Why is there a lamp on the floor?

856
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:17,610
What?

857
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,890
Atlantis is upside down.

858
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,170
That means that lamp was supposed to be on the floor surrounded by all this treasure.

859
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,210
Attaboy, lad. Keep going.

860
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,270
But why would you surround that thing with treasure unless--

861
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,540
BOTH: ...that's the real Jewel of Atlantis!

862
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,010
That thing lit up when the trap was sprung.

863
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,910
I bet my bottom dollar it's the power source that runs the city!

864
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,530
Uncle Donald, you gotta let the room flood so I can grab the jewel.

865
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,670
That's crazy!

866
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,660
I'm supposed to, what, let go?

867
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,760
Trust you?

868
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,560
Well, yeah, that's kind of all you can do.

869
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,100
This is a surprisingly insightful death trap!

870
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,440
(quacks)

871
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,350
(grunting)

872
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,430
(panting)

873
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,860
Ha! We're gonna be okay!

874
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,130
(grunting)

875
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,070
(screaming)

876
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,330
Oh, yeah, those guys.

877
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,750
Huey and Louie!

878
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,080
...are doing okay!

879
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,320
(grunting)

880
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,330
Wait! Where's Glomgold?

881
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,370
(walkie-talkie crackles)

882
00:39:54,370 --> 00:40:03,210
Hey, team. Wanted to thank you for keeping Scrooge's kin busy while I escape with the jewel and blow up Atlantis, with my most hated rival inside.

883
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,090
But I thought employees were greatest treasure of all!

884
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,300
Don't be ridiculous!

885
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,970
Treasure is the greatest treasure of all.

886
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,050
That's why it's called treasure! Glomgold out!

887
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,210
We have to go!

888
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,340
Huh?

889
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,110
Mr. Duck.

890
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,840
Could we, um, maybe, bum a ride with you?

891
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:34,370
(heroic music)

892
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,760
That was some quick thinking.

893
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,930
You just may be an adventurer yet, Dewey.

894
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,440
(reporters clamoring)

895
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,290
Aye, aye. Okay. Settle down.

896
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:57,670
Ha ha! Ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is with great pride that I, Flintheart Glomgold, present--

897
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,710
...the Jewel of Atlantis!

898
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,490
What?!

899
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,250
Is that Scrooge McDuck?

900
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,620
(clamor resumes)

901
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:17,920
An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.

902
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,330
Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?

903
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,840
That bauble?

904
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,950
That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.

905
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,820
No, it's not!

906
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,550
(splashing)

907
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,590
(roaring)

908
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,220
(screams) Curse you, McDuck!

909
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,540
Webby.

910
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,090
Uncle Hampus.

911
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:44,900
How long?

912
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,610
Whole time.

913
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,030
Granny, I can explain.

914
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,240
Dear, you are safer in a sunken city with Scrooge McDuck than you are locked in a vault in Fort Knox.

915
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,930
No more lies... and you can go with him wherever you like.

916
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,200
Now, Donald, don't--

917
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,720
Stop.

918
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,930
I admit, I'm a little overprotective.

919
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,810
A little?!

920
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:18,060
No matter what I do, these boys will get into trouble, so maybe, you could teach them how to get <i>out</i> of trouble.

921
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,140
Uncle Donald?

922
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,230
It might be okay if the boys saw you every once in a while.

923
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,140
(cheering)

924
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,040
Sometimes, like birthdays or federal holidays.

925
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,960
Nothing too...

926
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,080
(bang)

927
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,330
Ooh! I may have left the engine running in the houseboat.

928
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,310
I may have a dozen or so spare bedrooms in the mansion.

929
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,390
(chuckles)

930
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,510
(cheering)

931
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,890
There you have it.

932
00:42:51,890 --> 00:43:00,100
Reclusive adventure capitalist Scrooge McDuck is back, with family in tow, solving mysteries and rewriting history.

933
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,150
Easy. A little to the left.

934
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,010
No, no, no, no!

935
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,140
Did I do it good?

936
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,920
(laughter)

937
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,020
(screams)

938
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,220
Mom?

939
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,920
(panting)

940
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,960
Take that! (laughing)

941
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,820
Dewey, don't yell at your target before you fire.

942
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,830
You'll lose the element of surprise.

943
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,300
September 23rd!

944
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,220
You'd better duck!

945
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:25,930
(yelling)
You'd better duck!

946
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,770
Ahh! (grunts)

947
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,590
(laughter)

948
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,860
Like YayDucks! https://yp1.yayponies.no/yayducks/ducks.php
