225
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,728
   Now, let's not get crazy.    

226
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,396
   They're blocking the exit!   
            Plan A.             

227
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,431
        We survey the area,     
        find another exit...    

228
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,133
Plan B? Who needs a plan?       

229
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,468
            No, wait!           

230
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,103
[British accent] Oi, mates!     

231
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,572
Fancy seeing you lot            
in this here warehouse!         

232
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,241
                Um, who are you?

233
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,275
          Who are we?           

234
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,910
    We're the Beagle Birds,     

235
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,312
     Ma's adopted daughters     

236
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,280
  from across the pond, like.   

237
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,282
      Did Ma ever mention       
         a pond to you?         

238
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,318
                I don't think   
                she could swim. 

239
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,353
I don't even think              
she showers!                    

240
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,955
I smell a rat.                  

241
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,291
    We're from England, guv,    
just a little Cockney, innit?   

242
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,461
         Uh, meat pies,         
      bangers and mash...       

243
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,197
        Britty, darling,        
       oh, there you are!       

244
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,432
     Oh, thank you, gents!      

245
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,134
        My sister and I         
        will be certain         

246
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,535
            to tell             
    our dearest Mama Beagle     

247
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,037
  of the gracious hospitality   

248
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,438
      we've received here       
        in the Colonies.        

249
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,040
            This is Brittania,  

250
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,142
            and I'm, er...      

251
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,044
                Englabeth.      

252
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,713
        She talks fancy.        
          I trust her.          

253
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,649
Well, they are family.          
I mean, why would they lie?     

254
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,452
        Marvelous! Well, it was 
        wonderful to meet you.  

255
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,188
       -I'm taking this.        
          -Well, um...          

256
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,058
   A keepsake                   
   of our serendipitous meeting!

257
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,227
                    Stupendous! 

258
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,531
                Ta-ta!          

259
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,400
      Wait, was that them?      

260
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,375
          You totally           
     clowned those jokers,      

261
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,211
       and we got a radio       
     so we can track them!      

262
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,014
       Where did you get        
  that tea-and-crumpets talk?   

263
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,850
 I live with my British granny  
     in a Scottish mansion.     

264
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,587
I didn't hear an American accent
    till I was, like, seven.    

265
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,660
        With my brains          
        and your weirdly        
        specific super-brains,  

266
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,095
        we could run this town! 

267
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,696
            Innit that right,   
            Englabeth?          

268
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,232
Most indubitably,               
Brittania!                      

269
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,435
Hah! Wait until the guys        
hear my new nickname!           

270
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,238
    You mean those three nerds  
    who ditched you on a beach? 

271
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,707
                Yeah, they sound
                real fun.       

272
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,409
Oh, no, no!                     

273
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,678
There were only three spots     
on the boat,                    

274
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,279
so I let them go.               

275
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,448
We're cool like that.           
It's a family thing.            

276
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,284
            Family, huh?        
            Not really my thing.

277
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,420
    But family is the best!     

278
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,088
 You go on adventures together, 

279
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,256
       make inside jokes!       

280
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,092
         Like there was         
      this hilarious joke       

281
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,596
  where they went out boating   
    and Huey got them lost,     

282
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,899
   and since then, they call    
       him Captain Lost!        

283
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,035
        [laughter falls]        
 Yeah, I don't get it, either.  

284
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:54,906
Uff! Sometimes                  
it's like they have             
their own secret language.      

285
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,441
It's just--                     
I don't know.                   

286
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,443
They have so much               
history together.               

287
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,445
                Well, now       
                we have history.

       Well, this usually       
         never happens!         

298
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,080
     This is really weird!      
      Okay, stop talking!

    where have you been?        

302
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,455
    We've been worried          
    out of our minds!           

303
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,491
Well, uh, Lena and I...         

304
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,794
    Right, you were so worried  
    that you left her on a beach

305
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,096
            and didn't show up  
            for four hours?     

306
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,164
          We got lost!

in charge of the map again?

          [honks horn]          
      Where are the brats?      

449
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,721
             [all]              
             Um...              

450
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,090
       For the love of...       
           That's it.           

451
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,592
   None of you get birthdays    
           this year.           

452
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,195
         [all Beagles]          
              Aww.              

453
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,966
               That was awesome!

454
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,768
                How you made    
                the Beagle Boys 
                fight each other

455
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,203
      so we could escape,       
           and then--           

456
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,739
         Well, you shimmied up  
         that pillar like a pro.

457
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,374
You turned the entire           
Beagle family                   

458
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,042
against each other              
with a question.                

459
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,810
    You are my new favorite.    

460
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,646
                   No big.      

461
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,648
           That's what family's 
           about, eh, Englabeth?

462
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,917
Oh, I knew you'd come through   
in a spot, Brittania.           

463
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,553
A lil Penny-come-quick          
to get ya yet to be.            

464
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,921
             Fluff and nonsense.

465
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,224
        [girls laughing]        

466
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:36,761
           You kinda            
        had to be there.        

467
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:37,795
           [buzzes]             

468
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,408
 Summoned spirit from the dark, 

469
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,344
 show thyself before this arc.  

470
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,580
      Free thy dread soul       
        from its prison,        

471
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,817
 Once more shall thee be risen! 

472
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,654
      Aunt Magica, I'm in.
