485
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,610
         Looks like the only way
         to survive is to crash.

486
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,478
Too dangerous!                  
Too dangerous!

            you bucket of bolts.

489
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,858
          Oh, I'm sorry, is that
          offensive, or--

       [laughs] Whoo-ooh!       

494
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,273
           I'm alive!           
        This is awesome!        

495
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,476
         Aww, looks like        
         somebody's first crash.

496
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,453
       Have a good day, Mr. McD.

497
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,454
Nice work today, Launchpad.     

498
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,589
See you tomorrow.               

499
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,724
You're not gonna                
replace me?                     

500
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,593
                  Replace you?  
                  Don't be daft.

501
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,927
              Where would I ever
              find a driver     

502
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,663
          as crazy and dangerous
          as I am?              

503
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:09,600
         Oh! Dewey told me about
         your driver's license. 

504
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,602
                Congratulations.

505

506
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,640
Aww, your approval is           
all the driver's license I need.

507
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,642
Come on.                        
[straining]                     

508
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,211
               You should really
               keep the license.

509
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,450
            Sir, I was          
            cleaning out my desk

510
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,085
             when suddenly      
             the prototype armor

511
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,254
     burst from the chamber like
     so many split atoms, and-- 

512
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,656
Eh, save it.                    
You're not fired...

515
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,262
my inventions                   
are dangerous.                  

516
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,497
This armor's gotta be           
100% idiot proof,               

517
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,633
and, well, you're just          
the idiot to prove it.          

518
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,601
          Oh, thank you, sir!   
          You won't regret this.

519
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,870
   This project stays top secret
   till it's out of beta.

00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,272
            I won't tell a soul.
