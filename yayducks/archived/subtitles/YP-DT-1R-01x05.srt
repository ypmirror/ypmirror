                from miles away.

111
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,797
That was no                     
subway train.                   

112
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,041
             The Terra-firmians 
             are an ancient race

113
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,776
    built of two warring tribes.

114
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,911
                The Terries     
                and the Firmies.

115
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,781
           They were once united
           under a proud king.  

116
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,050
                After the king's
                untimely death, 

117
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:49,655
       an epic battle began over
       who would assume control.

118
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,129
        But one day the         
        rightful prince         

119
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,997
                  will reunite  
                  the two tribes

120
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,801
          and put an end to     
          their bitter conflict.

121
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,902
And what's that?                

122
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,604
              Oh, just a drawing

123
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,005
               of a candy       
               I wish they made.

124
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,740
         -Webbi-dings.          
           -And that?           

125
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,109
         Me as a superhero.     
         Look, can we just focus

126
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,678
             on all the exciting
             stuff I just said? 

127
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,646
    So these Terra thingies     

128
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,014
        are responsible         
        for that tremor?        

129
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,016
According to the JWG,           

130
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,118
earthquakes are shifting        
tectonic plates.                

131
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,820
Science fact.                   

132
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,155
No reason for any of us         
to go in there.                 

133
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,423
The book knows                  
everything.

136
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,827
       Did the book know        
      I was gonna do that?      

137
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,828
         Hmm.                   

138
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:39,004
        [rat squeaking]         

139
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,274
        Oh, I can't wait to meet
        a real Terra-firmian!   

140
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,309
               I'm totally gonna
               sacrifice myself 

141
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,844
                  in the name of
                  the rebellion.

142
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,946
Oh, and then I can              
hunt down your attackers        

143
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,981
    -and avenge your death.     
             -Aww!              

144
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,684
                   That's sweet.
                   There!       

145
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,720
Claw marks!                     

146
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,355
Proof they were here.           

147
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,556
          Even better!          

148
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,857
      The tremors exposed       

149
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,058
      three kinds of rock.      

150
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,461
        Schist, marble,         
          and gneiss.           

151
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,896
         Ooh, do I spy          
          some shale?           

152
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,865
How is that better              
than subway monsters?           

153
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,367
    'Cause my thing's real.     

154
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,369
        How can you dismiss this
        after all the stuff     

155
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,070
                we've seen      
                with Mr. McDuck?

156
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,072
    Most of that is actually    
    logged in the guidebook.    

157
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,807
               Even the headless
               man-horse?       

158
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,910
        It's a big book.        
  Anything new, I add myself.   

159
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:19,978
          Now help me           
      with the shale rock.      

160
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,513
            Need it             
     for my geology badge.      

161
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,081
               Why don't you ask
               your best friend,

162
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,983
                  the guidebook,
                  to help you?  

163
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,818
            Oh, wait, you can't.
            It's a book.        

164
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,255
"How to properly handle         
rock samples in the field."     

165
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,658
   Hmm. Ahem. Mm-hmm.

00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,077
I have some

  Well, there won't be anymore  
  afternoon field trips for you.

       I can assure you that.

               We're stuck.     

207
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,284
It looks like the only          
safe way out of here            

208
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,619
is to get                       
this train moving.              

209
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,020
Launchpad, get to               
the control room.

00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,056
          No, Mrs. B.           
 I can't leave you alone with-- 

211
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,028
               I mean, uh...    

212
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,663
          I don't know if I can.

213
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,632
              I've never crashed
              a train before.   

214
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,233
Well, maybe you can             
drive the train                 

215
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,168
without crashing it.            

216
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,037
              Huh?              

217
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,072
[sighs] Just get                
to the control room             

218
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,407
and see what you can do.        

219
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,544
           Fine. Hey, Dewey,    
           come with me.        

220
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:10,048
       I need someone to help me
       for some reason.

                   Just in case.

222
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,084
I'm going to the rear           
to see if I can                 

223
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,152
detach us from the cave in.

   You, with me.                

225
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,488
You've caused us                
enough grief.

           We'll stay here      
           and be on the lookout
           for Terra-firmians.  

228

       It must be about halftime
       at The Great Games,      

229
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,496
              so it'll be easier
              to spot one.      

230
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,265
      Okay.

               get out of here

        Ugh, okay, lady,        

235
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,909
        you are real bad        
      at asking for help.       

236
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,779
      [sighs] Please talk       
     some sense into Webby.     

237
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,547
        You don't really believe
        that rock monsters

               are playing      
               earthquake games.

      Huey's usually right      
       about nerd stuff.

Not this time.                  
Those aftershocks               

241
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,089
are actually a revolt

Terra-firmian prince.           

243
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,427
He's using the games            
as a distraction

        sounds awesome.

    I want<i> that</i> to be true.

                    Earthquakes 
                    are a result

249
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,304
                of shifting     
                tectonic plates.

250
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,207
But who's pushing               
the plates, Huey?

          Please, it's not safe!

Oh, this could be it.

This could be the prince.

        This could be...

           A way out?           

447
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,741
There's a way out!              

448
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,813
                     [Webby]    
                     Huey, wait!

449
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,148
Aah!

00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,416
           -[growls]            
          -[startles]           

451
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,320
           [gasping]            

452
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,556
            -[gasp]             
             -Huh?              

453
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,668
I told you                      
they were real.                 

454
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,702
         He must be the prince. 

455
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,871
            And the others      
         are his rebel force.   

456
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,140
             They must've gotten
             trapped down here. 

457
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,608
This must be the prince         

458
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,478
of the bill-faced creatures     
of the land above.              

459
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,713
And the others                  
are his rebel force.            

460
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,782
                 I told you     
                 they were real.

461
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,721
[Mrs. Beakley]                  
Huey!                           

462
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:04,802
             [both]             
             Boop.              

463
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,010
That was interesting.           

464
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,478
         We still need          
       to find a way out.       

465
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,813
          -[rumbling]           
             -Look!             

466
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,785
        They smashed us         
            an exit.            

467
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,658
Thank you, fellow               
underground creatures.          

468
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,860
            Sorry I doubted you.

469
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,262
    I'm proud of you, Huey.     

470
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,898
       Facing your fears,       
    embracing the unknown...    

471
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,867
              And... loved it!  
              No longer unknown.

472
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,836
                   They exist.  
                   Science fact.

473
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,272
              [sighs] That feels
              so much better.   

474
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:42,807
        Ugh.                    

475
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,845
       I really could get       
    used to being down here.    

476
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,716
                 I love being   
                 a mole monster!

477
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,252
Launchpad, you are              
not a mole monster.             

478
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,787
            Oh, well, all right.
            Makes sense.        

479
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,060
Why didn't you leave            
the big purple one?             

480
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,229
She's getting in the way        
of our plans.                   

481
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,198
                  [Mrs. Beakley]
                  Lena.         

482
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,201
   Listen, dear, I may have been
   a bit quick to judge you.    

483
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,938
    Would you like to join us   
    at the mansion for pancakes?

484
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,206
  Now, when you say "pancakes"  

485
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,774
do you mean like actual pancakes

486
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,910
       or English muffins       
    covered in maple syrup?     

487
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,913
       I mean actual pancakes.  

488
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:23,914
           Then yes.            

489
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,783
            Lena, you're welcome

490
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,451
        at the mansion any time.

491
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,988
             That's why.        

492
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,957
       Gotta play the long game.

493
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,392
                   Hey, wait up!

494
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,294
            [hisses]
