00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,027
    Do you want your eyes       
    to freeze out of your head? 

123
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,129
That would make                 
flying harder.                  

124
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,298
   You're also gonna want       
   this heat-reflecting blanket,

125
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,133
        this oxygen tank        
        to keep your mind sharp 

126
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,001
    when the fever starts       
    killing off your brain cells

127
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,304
    with a thousand             
    footwarmers Footcoolers     
    commemorative canteen,      

128
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,073
    Gore, Grip, Grop,           
    and these state-of-the-art  
    smart heating gloves        

129
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,075
           that get an ice fever
           rating of eight!     

130
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,210
    Hmm...                      

131
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,011
                Out of seven?   

132
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,081
        Ooh!                    

133
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,154
                All right,      
                true explorers! 

134
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,991
    Now, this mountain          
    is gonna throw everything   
    she's got at us!            

135
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:04,195
       But it'll be worth it    
       when we find the treasure
       of Mount Neverrest!      

136
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,931
        There is no treasure    
        of Mount Neverrest.     

137
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,268
        Nope, Louie out.        
         Already gone.          

138
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,904
             Have fun!          

139
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,139
                    [bloop]     

140
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,210
       Let's go set foot        
       on the roof of the world!

141
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,213
         And then throw         
       ourselves off it!        

142
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,982
        Yeah!                   

143
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,853
[Launchpad] First the ice fever 
takes your vision.              

144
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,855
Then it makes you feel          
all warm and toasty,            

145
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,190
even though                     
you're freezing to death.       

146
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,025
Then it makes                   
your limbs all heavy.           

147
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,260
                Ach, it's just  
                a bit nippy.    

148
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,029
        How did you afford      
        all that gear, anyway?  

149
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,931
Louie put it on his             
corporate credit card.          

150
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,100
        Louie doesn't have      
        a corporate credit card.

151
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,303
Oh. Louie gave me               
your credit card.               

152
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,311
                    Now?        

153
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,215
Not yet. We've only got         
one shot at this.               

154
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,317
Once you're down,               
there's no coming back up.      

155
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,153
                    Right.      

156
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,956
            Can't wait! [grunts]

157
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,961
Maximum opportune moment!       

158
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,030
        Ugh. Fine.              

159
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,270
      Point of no return,       
   this way to certain death,   

160
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,006
     this way to... cocoa.      

161
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:26,110
              Hmm.              
     [both] Certain death!      

162
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,013
  [Scrooge] That's the spirit.  

163
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,083

           -[grunts]            

164
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,918
             Whoa!              

165
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,089
        Launchpad, hand me      
   my climbing spats, will ya?  

166
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,991
       Whoa! Ow! Ooh! Ow!       

167
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,993
          Launchpad?            

168
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:46,164
     [grunting, screaming]      

169
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,198
                Where'd he go?  

170
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,433
           He had half          
        of our equipment!       

171
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,435
         [screams] Oh!          

172
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,006
       [gibbers, screams]       

173
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,976
        Ugh. Where am I?        

174
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,445
      I've gone snowblind!      

175
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,180
        The ice fever's         
          setting in!           

176
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,148
             No!!!              

177
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,017
      [distant screaming]       

178
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,287
      Probably cozying up       
with hot cocoa along with Louie.

179
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,423
        Anyone else want        
        to check it out?        

180
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,126
       Last thing we need       
          on this trip          

181
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,461
           is a bunch           
     of Neverrest Ninnies.      

182
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,196
            I thought you said  
            that was a myth.    

183
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,998
Just because it's a myth        

184
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,466
doesn't mean it's not true.     

185
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,067
                Well, actually--

186
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,302
Don't you worry, kids.          

187
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,005
It'll take more                 
than a pompous pile of pebbles  

188
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,473
to slow your                    
old Uncle Scrooge down!         

189
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:33,411
I promise, I won't let          
anything bad happen to you.     

190
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,381
          -[cracking]           
           -[screams]           

191
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,152
          From now on!          
    Nothing bad from now on!    

192
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,355
Heads down, knees up!           
Let's go!                       

193
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,330
I'm gonna call                  
this Murder Ridge,              

194
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,498
    after Death Peak,           

195
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,067
      but before the Chasm      
      of Infinite Despair.      

196
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,203
    Aw. I'll call               
    that Bunny Rock.            

197
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,506
    [screaming]                 

198
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,110
            Hmm. I'm still gonna
            call it Bunny Rock. 

199
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,188
Curse me kilts.                 

200
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,157
        End of the line,        
         Uncle Scrooge?         

201
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,095
                  Hmm.          

202
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,232
                [blooping]      

203
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,202
     [heavenly music plays]     

204
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,237
Well, looks like                
we'll have to settle            

205
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,539
for a double luge-de-luge       

206
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,542
and a moderate alley-oop        
flatsmans 540.                  

207
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,243
                Sledding!       

208
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,312
       -[ice pick clinks]       
     -[success noise dings]     

209
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,215
Hey, hey!                       
Nice try, Neverrest!            

210
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,483
            [both] Yeah!        

211
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:49,220
             Aw. I mean... yeah.

212
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,221
           [bangs]              

213
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,490
         So... hot.             

214
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,293
            Oh, no!             
  The next stage of ice fever!  

215
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,296
 I can't remove any of my gear, 
    or I'll freeze to death!    

216
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,466
       Ugh. Limbs heavy.        

217
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,468
      Movements lethargic.      

218
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,403
          -Watch it!            
            -Hey!               

219
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:10,074
    I can hear the shrill wail  
    of Neverrest's cruel wind   
    calling me.                 

220
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,443
          Surrender...          

221
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,247
    No! This is not the end     
     of Launchpad McQuack!      

222
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,184
   It will be by plane crash    
         or not at all!         

223
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,587
Aah! A yeti!                    

224
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,423
  [Scrooge] Don't need this...  
          all this...           

225
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,158
       What even is this?       

226
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,260
    Certainly don't need this!  

227
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,164
Um, the Junior Woodchuck Guide  
suggests we need at least some  
of this stuff.                  

228
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,466
      We don't need anything    
    but grit, gumption, and--   

229
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,534
            And water!          

230
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,369
                    Now?        

231
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,539
I think that would technically  
be more falling than sledding.  

232
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,513
       Ha-ha! Take that,        
  you mag-nelequent molehill!   

233
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,318
          What a rush!          
  I thought we were done for.   

234
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,522
            Nonsense, lad!      
            We're going straight
            to the top.         

235
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,458
We must've gained               
some serious altitude           
with that climb.                

236
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,527
We should be closer             
than ever, and--                

237
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,362
Wait, is that Bunny Rock?       

238
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,630
This can't be right!            

239
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,498
Maybe we should backtrack       

240
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,367
to figure out                   
where we went wrong.            

241
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,236
        Please! I'm sure that's 
        an entirely different   

242
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,372
        naturally occurring     
        demon-faced rock.       

243
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:18,376
Okay, but it is snowing,        
so the smart thing to do is--   

244
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,544
            Set up camp!        

245
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,180
        There's a cave          
    up about 500 meters ahead.  

246
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,321
-See?                           
-Cool dark and foreboding cave, 
 Uncle Scrooge!                 

247
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,557
But this area's uncharted.      
How did you know                
this would be here?             

248
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:37,362
        Uh, guys, I don't think 
        we're the first climbers
        to have this idea.      

249
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,597
        Whoa.                   

250
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,167
          Where are their heads?

251
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,269
[Webby] Found 'em!              

252
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,207
Uh, maybe we find               
a slightly less deadly cave.    

253
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,510
Wait, the entrance              
was right here.                 

254
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,412
We must've gotten               
turned around.                  

255
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,280
It's gotta                      
be here somewhere!              

256
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,415
             [gasp]             

257
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,422
           Is that...           

258
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,257
    George Mallardy.            

259
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,193
      Greatest mountaineer      
      of the 20th century.      

260
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,563
Wait, he's written something    
out on the wall here.           

261
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,299
            "Curse you, McDuck."

262
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,201
            [bloop]             

263
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,371
Ach, jinx. If I had a nickel    
for every person                

264
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,373
who cursed me                   
with their dying breath,        

265
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,541
I'd be as rich                  
as I already am.                

266
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,443
            Junior Woodchuck    
            Rule 1118--         

267
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:29,447
    a Woodchuck chief           
    must always be honest       
    with his crew.              

268
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,449
Fine. Ugh.                      

269
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,418
I was the Neverrest Ninny.      

270
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,453
                [all] What?     

271
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,289
Seventy-five years              
ago today,                      

272
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:42,293
        <i> I hired Mallardy</i>       
  <i> to lead me up the mountain.</i>  

273
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,228
         <i> I'd just made</i>         
       <i> my first million,</i>       

274
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,630
      <i> and I wanted to mark</i>     
          <i> the occasion</i>         

275
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,299
       <i> by doing something</i>      
     <i> no one had ever done.</i>     

276
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,568
        <i> I may have been</i>        
    <i> a little inexperienced,</i>    

277
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,272
       <i> but I didn't want</i>       
  <i> to leave anything to chance.</i> 

278
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,407
[laughs]                        

279
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,444
       <i> Mallardy mocked me</i>      
          <i> mercilessly.</i>         

280
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,614

    <i> my emergency supplies</i>      

282
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,353
    <i> and my sizeable money belt,</i>

283
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,655
      <i> so he cut me loose.</i>      

284
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,657
       <i> I was weighed down</i>

285
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,326
          <i> and branded</i>          
      <i> the Neverrest Ninny.</i>     

286
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,427
           [laughing]           

287
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,363
Mallardy was never              
heard from again.               

288
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,368
But he became the man to make it
the farthest up the mountain!   

289
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,772
   Now he's the second farthest!

290
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,440
Uncle Scrooge!                  

291
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,509
        What? He was            
        a backstabbing braggart 

292
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,677
                who almost      
                got me killed!  

293
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,345
I think the mountain            
got even for you.               

294
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,448
        And now we'll get even  
        with the mountain!      

295
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,352
 We will brave the new frontier,
        chart the unknown!      

296
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,522
How can I chart                 
the unknown if I don't know     
what I'm charting!              

297
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,391
I'm telling you,                
this mountain doesn't           
make any sense.                 

298
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,627
        I think I hear the wind 
        coming from this way.   

299
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,628
Webby, wait!                    

300
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,363
        Good initiative,        
        Webbigail!              

301
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,497
            Thanks, Mr. McDuck! 

302
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,632
                [bloop]         

303
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,367
Didn't you just--               
Weren't you--?                  

304
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,368
            I found an opening. 

305
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,404
        Lead the way!           

306
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,476
           -Whoo-hoo!           
          -We made it!          

307
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,378
      We should be closer       
         than ever now.         

308
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,613
Is that Bunny Rock?             

309
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,750
     [Scrooge] Aw, come on!     

310
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,487
         The ice fever          
        in final stages.        

311
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,591
        Must stay warm.         

312
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,560
    Uh, Launchpad?              

313
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,563
                So warm!        

314
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,331
    Launchpad!                  

315
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,366
                [screams]       

316
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,569
            Louie, is that you? 

317
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,737
                Stay calm,      
                little buddy.   

318
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,672
    We need to find a way       
    off this mountain           

319
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,574
    before ice fever            
    takes us both.              

320
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,743
        You know ice fever      
        is not a thing, right?  

321
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,679
You're talking crazy.           
You must have it, too.          

322
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,515
Crazy talk is the third stage   
of ice fever!                   

323
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,683
            Who told you that?  

324
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,518
The guy who sold me             
this blanket.                   

325
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,588
    Standard double snake oil.  
    I see how it is.            

326
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,690
            Well, no one cons   
            my family but me!   

327
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,426
Our combined body heat          
will save us both.              

328
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,595
Soak in the wetness             
of my sweat!                    

329
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,731
        Ew! So much wetness! Ew!

330
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,372
At last!                        

331
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,575
After all these years,          
the summit of Mount Neverrest!  

332
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,744
We're in the clear              
now, kids!                      

333
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,413
Ha-ha!                          

334
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,486
[squeaky, nervous laugh]        

335
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,456
           That's it!           
   I'm putting my foot down.    

336
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,724
        We can't go forward!    

337
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,560
       Of course we can.        
   The summit's right there!    

338
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,563
  We are violating every rule   
of my Junior Woodchuck training!

339
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,465
    We're out of supplies,      
    it's starting to get cold,  

340
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,633
        so even if we make it   
        to the top,             

341
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,901
        we'd freeze to death    
        before we get down.     

342
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,803
    Oh, and if we keep trying   
    to go up this way,          

343
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,472
    the whole thing             
    is gonna come crashing down!

344
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,640
          This is all too risky!

345
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,642
Don't you go ninny              
on me, lad!                     

346
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,811
    You'll never get            
    your cartography badge      
    with that attitude!         

347
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,747
     I don't care!              
     We have to turn around now!

348
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,649
          -[both] Now!          
          -[rumbling]           

349
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,651
      You already beat Mallardy.
      Isn't that enough?        

350
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,921
No! We'd be daft to give up     
with the peak in our grasp.     

351
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,491
  It's not giving up.           
  It's just having common sense.

352
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:04,662
For the last time,              
nothing bad is going to happen! 

353
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,698
          [both] Whoa!          

354
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,468
        -[screaming]            
        -Dewey! Webby!          

355
