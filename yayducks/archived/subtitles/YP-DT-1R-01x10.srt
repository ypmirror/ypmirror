  It<i> used</i> to be amazing,        

121
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,437
 until Scrooge                  
 and his mortal riff-raff       

122
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,540
 showed up and ruined it!       

123
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,342
            -What?!

       I'm sorry. Della."       

127
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,116
   We're close to the truth.    
         I can feel it.         

128
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,652
What if my mom explored         
this very path?

I can still smell her feet.     

132
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,526
       So we know Della         
       took the Spear of Selene 

133
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,729
       and betrayed Mr. McDuck

          We don't know         
          she did something bad.

135
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,733
              That note can mean
              lots of things.

"Of Heroes"? Aha!               

146
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:02,360
Pretty good sign                
my mom wasn't a traitor.        

147
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,164

      for gods and heroes.

00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,602
           And I was

       Everyone loved me.

    Then Scrooge showed up.     

152
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,609
Defeated the unkillable Gorgon. 

153
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,278
Found the lost treasure of Troy.

           like he was so cool  
           and ruined it!

161

     So, where is everyone?     

162
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,597

            when you did.       

163
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,599
     Said they didn't want      
     to party with a "lame god" 

164
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,236

is the very blood in your veins!

   Of course!

420
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,465
  I heard Scrooge and his family
  were on the island,           

421
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,168
      so I wrote a super-spooky 
      prophecy on the door      

422
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,469
       to lure my friend Della. 

423
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,138
      It usually does the trick.

424
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,306
   So, where's                  
   the Spear of Selene, Selene? 

425
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,142
      -What spear?              
      -The one Della took       
      from your garden.         

426
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,943
  You mean the Sphere of Selene?

427
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,979
       Why does no one          
       get what I'm saying?!

429
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,151
       I've never had a spear.  

430
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,153
Do you mean the Sword of Selene?
That's down the hall--          

431
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,289
    No! The Spear of Selene!    
    The one my mom took!

  to finding her!

       Ah, your Della's kid!    

434
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,862
           I shoulda realized-- 
           you're just like her.

435
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,532
        I'm sorry. I haven't    
        seen her in years,      

436
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,535
        and I don't know what   
        the Spear of Selene is. 

437
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,770
So we're back to                
"she stole Scrooge's spear      

438

          more than anything    
          in the world.

00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,547
Della wasn't just a good person,
she was the greatest.           

442
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,849
     And she made               
     everyone around her better.

443
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,451
        Maybe the spear         
        isn't an artifact.      

444
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,520
   Maybe it's something else!   

445
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,856
           Your mom did love    
           a good mystery.
