00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,433
 Thanks for the help, Liu Hai!

          We can make it in time

There's tons more games.

Oh, and the buffet.             

338
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,478
                       I get it.

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,980
          You're the cool uncle.

Oh, dang.                       

343
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,793
Did I not mention               
I'm a prisoner here             

344
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,661
and that's why                  
I called you for help?          

345
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,297
             What?              
  Why didn't you just tell us?  

346
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,266
           [Liu Hai]            
     Because I'd find out.      

347
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:53,191
  I am Liu Hai, ancient spirit  
     of chance and fortune.     

348
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,661
   Now, let's test your luck.   

349
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,731

00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,270
         I sat through          
    The Waters of Aquanadon     

352
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,572
three times when I could've been
       fighting a demon?        

353
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,340
It's Aquarioon.

354
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,075
Uh, yeah, you don't wanna       
mess with Toad.                 

355
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,410
He's a luck vampire.            

356
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,544
He's held me captive here       

357
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,380
to feast off my                 
natural good luck.              

358
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,447
I'm that delicious.             

359
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,516
        Are you bragging        
          about that?           

360
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,952
                I hoped Donald  
                would break     
                my lucky streak.

          -The worst.           

363
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:28,293
Gladstone's good fortune        
has been satisfying,            

364
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:31,296
but surely, as the              
richest duck in the world,      

365
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:35,099
Scrooge McDuck's luck must be   
the most delicious feast of all.

366
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,735
     Luck has nothing to do     
        with my success.        

367
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,537
    Oh, really?                 

368
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,706
         I'll prove it.         
           One game.

00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,375
   If I win, you set us free.

          permanently.

  Unless you think the spirit   
 of luck and fortune will lose. 

372
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,285
Hmm, I can't resist             
such a challenge.

                 belongs to me.

442
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:46,951
             -Whoa!             
          -[laughing]           

443
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:47,985
             What?              

444
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,556
        [kids cheering]         

445
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:52,857
  Well, at least I still have   

446
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,725
 the luckiest buffet on Earth.  

447
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,861
Bad fortune, Mr. Gander.        

448
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,831
        Actually, Toad,         
    Gladstone lost to Donald    

449
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,801
   so technically, Donald is    
 the new luckiest guy on Earth. 

450
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,636
        It's really him         
        you should take.        

451
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,572
Yeah!                           
Wait, no!                       

452
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,374
 Hmm, a well-reasoned argument. 

453
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,376
    Donald Duck is my prize.    

454
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,811
     That wasn't the deal!      

455
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,881
       All bets are off.        

456
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,784
             Uh-oh.             

457
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,922
Uncle Donald!                   

458
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,924
I can't believe                 
you just gave him up.           

459
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,327
            The kid's not wrong,
            Uncle McDuncle.     
            What do we do?      

460
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,330
        Three, two, one.        

461
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,565
   [Donald muttering, grunts]   

462
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,834
His luck, it's awful!           

463
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,936
           So awful!            

464
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,806
           [rumbling]           

465
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,748
           So awful!            

466
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,952
You did it, Uncle Donald!       
You won!                        

467
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,354
That was pretty cool.           

468
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,989
I mean, especially for you.     

469
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,927
          How the heck          
           did I win?           

470
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,396
I guess you're not              
so lucky, after all.            

471
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,531
   But if you think about it,   
        we're all free.         

472
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:11,202
 So, me losing is the luckiest  
 thing that could've happened.  

473
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,471
             Boom!              
Still the luckiest guy on Earth 

474
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,374
          and a hero.           
              Huh?              

475
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,776
     Eh, luck's overrated.      

476
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,945
           [panting]            

477
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:24,582
        Whoa, Launchpad,        
     what happened to you?      

478
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,951
                  Eh, you know, 
                  tourist stuff.

479

       wherever you are.        

480

    Have I really just been

       Who is Gladstone?        

483
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,302
 I need to get my hands dirty.  

484
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,803
    Do something meaningful.    

485
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,271
     A new, noble purpose.

       [yacht horn honks]       

488
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,810
  I need to get rid of my boat  
       for tax purposes.        

489
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,412
  I'll sell it to you for $20.  

490
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:58,416
    Gladstone is back, baby!    

491
