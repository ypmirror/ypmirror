              shoe sizes,       

33
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,698

00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,209
   Uncle Donald just told us    
         she was gone.          

38
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,745
         The only thing         
 we have of her is this photo.

            my Della Duck file. 

41
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,585
     You have a whole file      
           on my mom?           

42
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,154
     Seriously? This is it?     

43
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:05,090
I've been looking               
into her for years,             
but there's nothing.            

44
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,494
No photos, no records.          
No one even talks about her.    

45
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,997
One time, a piece of            
junk mail with her name         
on it showed up at our door,    

46
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,666
and a day later,                
Scrooge bought the post office, 

47
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,402
and I never saw                 
our mailman again.              

48
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,404
       Maybe he retired?        

49
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,241

67
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:18,830

have to use the bathroom.       

68
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,434
    Oh, and I will show you     
   where to go to that place.

     Mr. McDuck's archives

00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,958
You want me to count            
the gold?                       

85
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,860
Can we go out                   
and spend some gold             

86
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,195
to make sure                    
it doesn't expire?              

87
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:26,098
     There's more to money      
        than just money.        

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,634
Gold is a beautiful thing,      

89
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,737
but even something              
as small as a dime              
can have meaning.               

90
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:32,838
For instance...                 

91
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,876
   Are you out of your head?    
   You'll crack your skull open.

92
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,645
But you swim in money           
all the time.                   

93
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,981
     Yes, but I worked hard     
     to perfect that skill,     

94
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,817
                building muscles
                and dexterity.  

95
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,321
     If you want something,     
    you work hard to get it.    

96
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,491
     SECRETARY:<i> Mr. McDuck,</i>     
 <i> the board is here to see you.</i>

00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,293
         We don't have          
     a board meeting today.     

98
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,094
                No matter.      
                Come, lad.      

99
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,964
       Welcome to the fast-paced
       world of business.       

100
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,000
          As you know,          
       revenues are down        

101
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,568
      in our international      
           markets--

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,006
      Dawson, Lillehammer,      
     Eldorado, and Culebra.

104
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,643
  Shut up, everyone.            
  I've done something brilliant.

105
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,912
           Ah, Gyro.            
        Gyro Gearloose,         

106
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,014
           my head of           
   research and development.    

107
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,917
     - I'm sorry, but we--      
      - Apology accepted.       

108
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,852
       Now try to keep up       
  with my mind-numbing genius.  

109
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,289
  Gyro, what did we say about   
 interacting with other people? 

110
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,992
        The cards. Fine.        

111
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,362
      "Hello, Mr. McDuck,       
          and others.           

112
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,863
   Are you tired of all those   
       single-use gadgets       

113
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,832
         cluttering up          
       your junk drawer?        

114
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,600
          What a mess.          

115
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,936
       There's got to be        
         a better way!"         

116
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,705
        Meet Lil' Bulb,         
           the tiny,            

117
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,606
       all-purpose robot        
       that does it all.        

118
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,308
     Wait, what does it do?     

119
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,377
            It all.             

120
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,878
  Lil' Bulb is an artificially  
          intelligent           

121
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
     personal robot helper.     

122
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,383
       He can make toast,       
        find your keys,         

123
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,985
     serve as a book light      
  for your late-night reading.  

124
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,656
    You'll never have to do     
    anything yourself again.    

125
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,459
     Mm-hmm. And how do you     
        ensure this one         

126
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:03,161
won't achieve sentience and turn
   evil like all the others?    

127
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,064
    Only half my inventions     
           turn evil.           

128
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,667
         The other half         
 are just wildly misunderstood. 

129
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,968
          ( buzzing )           

130
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,203
        What's it doing?        

131
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,439
           Waving. It likes you.

132
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,909
        Request denied.         

133
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,479
           ( sighs )            

134
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,348
           Keep at it, Gyro.    
           I know you'll come up
           with something great.

135
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,384
Lil' Bulb                       
is something great.             

136
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,586
I'll show you.                  
I'll show you all!              

137
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:31,089
          And maybe wait until  
          you're out of the room
          to say that next time.

138
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,891
A robot that does               
everything for you?             

139
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,726
How could you                   
say no to that?                 

140
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,262
            Part of hard work   
            is knowing how      
            to work with others.

141
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,265
  My board are the only people  
       cheaper than I am.       

142
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,668
I trust them completely to make 
   good financial decisions--   

143
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,337
      Indeed. Which is why      
   we've called this meeting    

144
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,038
       to discuss cutting       
   your unnecessary spending    

145
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,741
     here at the Money Bin.     

146
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,109
         Unnecessary?!          

147
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,944
      I'm Scrooge McDuck.       

148
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,180
    I don't spend one penny     
      more than I need to.      

149
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,116
 It's says here you're spending 
          $15 million           

150
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,385
      on magical defense.       

151
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,587
      Do you have any idea      

152
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,557
   how many vengeance curses    
       I have on my head?       

153
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,026
    Think I'm just              
    gonna go                    

154
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,128
    and get a drink.            
    Yeah.                       

155
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,533
         <i> The Collected</i>

        <i> of Plain Awful.</i>

158
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,074
              Fresh cookies.    
                I knew it.      

159
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,309
Focus, Webby.                   

160
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,745
We're here to find out          
about Della Duck.               

161
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,981
           So the blue one seeks
           to learn of his past.

162
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,151
         But is he strong enough
         to learn the truth?    

163
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,420
              Yes.              

164
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:38,123
           Wrong! You must first
           prove yourself worthy

165
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,892
          by passing the trials!

166
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,396
                ( coughing )

169
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,570
         A dollar ten?          

170
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,139
    Who keeps dimes on them     
            anymore?            

171
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,848
       Sweet. Scrooge has       
       an emergency dime.       

172
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,420
    I'll pay you back later.    

173
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,989
     But how do you justify     
        spending $5,000         

174
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,358
       on a velvet pillow       
          for a dime?           

175
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,828
That dime deserves              
its own velvet pillow.          

176
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,130
It's my number-one dime.        

177
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,600
The first dime                  
I ever earned.                  

178
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,469
    I was a young shoe shine    
           in Glasgow           

179
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,506

   <i> I worked and worked until</i>   
     <i> those boots sparkled.</i>     

181
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:36,681
     <i> In return, he gave me</i>     
       <i> an American dime.</i>       

182

     <i> That dime inspired me</i>     
       <i> to move to America</i>      

183
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,621
      and find my fortune.      

184
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:46,191
      It means more to me       
   than every bit of bullion    

185
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,026
        in my Money Bin.

             Uh...              

188
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,098
        I gotta go. Bye.        

189
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,067
      Gotta get the dime,       
      gotta get the dime!

201
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,075
          Okay. Easy.           

202
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,211
    Break in, grab the dime,    
     sneak back downstairs,     

203
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,347
       Oh, maybe stop at        
      the vending machine.      

204
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,656

222
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:45,310
 You must decipher the ancient  
  and mysterious code within.   

223
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,345
Yes! I love codes!              

224
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,481
Dewey, you start with           
a Number Shift Cipher           

225
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,683
while I try                     
a Monoalphabetic Substitution.  

226
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,652
  Pretty sure this is           
  just a library card catalogue.

227
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,986
        Mystery solved.         

228
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,855
       Oh, yeah? If it's        
     just a card catalogue,     

229
00:10:56,857 --> 00:11:00,191
        then how does it        
        know your name?         

230
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,160
            Come on!            

231
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,168
          ( panting )           

232
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,270
      Hey, Gyro Gearloose.      

233
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,172
        If this is about        
the Gearloose Magnetic backpack,

234
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,207
      I specifically said       
    they should not be used     

235
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,309
        as school bags.         
    Blathering blatherskite,    

236
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,311
      one teen gets stuck       
    to a moving school bus.     

237
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,980
      No, no, no, no, no.       

238
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,416
          Louie Duck,           
  Scrooge's super-rich nephew.  

239
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,219
            Keep talking... sir.

240
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,288
I can't believe Scrooge         
and that tired old              
board of his                    

241
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,490
didn't see the potential        
in Lil' Bulb here.              

242
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,227
      I'd love to invest,       
       but I'm gonna need       

243
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,796
    to test this little guy     
           out first.           

244
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,731
    Do you mind if I borrow     
     him for the afternoon?     

245
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,700
       Anything you say,        
          rich nephew.          

246
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,635
    Lil' Bulb, you be good.     

247
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,204
       Don't you rise up        
     against your masters.      

248
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,241
      Ha ha. Just a little      
          robot humor.          

249
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,847
     Wait. I need to go...      
              up!               

250
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,650
     ( imitating Scrooge )      
   Put in a hard day's work.    

251
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,252
I think I'm so much             
smarter than--                  

252
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,021
                  Louie! Where  
                  have you been?

253
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,489
               Trying to get out
               of work again.   

254
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,558
What? No.                       

255
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,226
I just, um...                   

256
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,662
filled up my notepad            
with all that precious          
business wisdom,                

257
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,497
so I went to go                 
find another.                   

258
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,833
                      Good lad. 

259
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,235
       You're free to take      
       as many pads as you want.

260
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,670
           Or are we not allowed
           to use those either, 

261
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,705
               ye penny-pinching
               buzzards?!       

262
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,707
                 No, but really.

263
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,776
      Make sure to use the front
      and back of every page.   

264
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,245
                And write small.

265
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,082
         And that's how         
       you unlock a door.       

266
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,852
       - Good job, Louie.       
         - ( buzzing )          

267
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,387
   Finding one specific dime    
          in this mess          

268
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,757
          is gonna be           
       a pretty big job.        

269
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,458
           You better get to it.

270
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,567
      It's, like, a dime.       
      Ah, you'll find it.       

271
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,270
   <i> Ready to put your feet up,</i>  
         <i> Mr. Glomgold?</i>         

272
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,638
                  <i> You call this</i>
                  <i> an ottoman?</i>  

273
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,240
            <i> It does not even</i>   
            <i> have my face on it.</i>

274
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,274
                   <i> Do it again!</i>

275
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,177
       ( laughing )             

276
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,501
   In order to gain knowledge   
       from the Archives,       

277
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,738
         one must first         
      offer up knowledge.       

278
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,673
              Look, Quackfaster.

279
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,975
 Normally I would be super-into 
 a mysterious conspiracy quest. 

280
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,477
                But couldn't you
                at least give me

281
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,345
          a tiny piece of       
          information on my mom?

282
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,915
     Dewey, don't question      
      the ancient methods.      

283
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,349
        I'm just saying,        

284
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,751
   these are feeling a little   
       less like trials,        

285
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,319
       and a little more        
         like stalling.         

286
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,123
 It is not for us to understand 
   the ways of the Archives.    

287
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,525
       That is literally        
           your job.            

288
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,327
            I'm out.            
   She doesn't know anything.   

289
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,430
No. None shall leave            
once the Trials are undertaken. 

290
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,700
There are those who would       
destroy you for the knowledge   
you seek.                       

291
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,703
          ( whispers )          
          Just like the mailman.

292
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,972
    Who's gonna destroy me?     
    Scrooge? The government?    

293
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,340
    The Unicorn Illuminati?     

294
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,775
            - Me.               
            - Wait.             
            - What?!            

295
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:10,815
    GLOMGOLD:<i> You expect me</i>     
      <i> to put my feet up on</i>     
    <i> my own face, you loons?</i>    

296
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,851
          <i> Do it again!</i>         

297
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,053
   I used to hate this show,    
   but now, I kinda love it.    

298
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,021
    It's like every ottoman     
         tells a story.         

299
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,358
       Hey, you found it.       

300
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,427
   Great job... little buddy.   

301
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,034
         ( shrieking )          

302
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,173
If you can find me 3,000 gallons
 of silver polish for cheaper,  

303
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,141
   I'd love to hear about it!   

304
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,810
  This is getting us nowhere.   

305
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,745
       If you won't make        
         your own cuts,         

306
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,214
then we're forced to fire staff 
   at the Bin to save money.    

307
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,583
       The obvious choice       
       is the archivist.        

308
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,752
   Fire Quackfaster?! Never!    

309
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,021
   For 50 years, that woman's   
        level-headedness        

310
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,024
      has kept my archives      
      secure and orderly.       

311
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,226
  You disrespect the Archives,  

312
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,529
          you shall become      
          one with the Archives!

313
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,231
      This isn't working.       

314
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,833
Here. Knowledge is              
the greatest weapon of all.     

315
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,077
    Fine. Quackfaster stays.    

316
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,847
     But Gyro is definitely     
          unnecessary.          

317
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,548
        Are you insane?!        

318
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,584
       Gyro Gearloose is        
one of the most brilliant minds 

319
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,085
          of our time.          

320
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,591
         You miserable          
         piece of rust.         

321
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,259
           I am man,            
        you are machine.        

322
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,795
        Do as I command         
   or I will pull your plug.    

323
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,697
Aaah! He's turned               
against me.                     

324
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,300
He's sucking up                 
all the dimes. Help, help!      

325
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,137
              Oh.               

326
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,643
    If you're going to fire     
       all the employees,       

327
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,212
  why don't you just go ahead   
  and shut the whole Bin down?  

328
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,481
    You do have a perfectly     
     good office downtown.      

329
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,718
       Do you really need       
          a Money Bin?          

330
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,756
      I think we lost her.      

331
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,658
         Foolish child.         

332
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,260
        You do not know         
    what you think you know.    

333
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,062
                    I don't know
                    anything,   

334
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,164
                 and it's really
                 frustrating!   

335
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,467
            - Louie!            
      - Louie, over here.       

336
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,902
          ( screams )           

337
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,337
                 Uh, never mind.

338
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,172
      Look, a distraction.      

339
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,113
          Lazy Tuesday          
    was an afternoon of TV.     

340
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:25,516
          Hard working          
    was giant robot attack.     

341
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,918
  Great life lesson, Scrooge.   

342
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,162
     No!                        

343
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,597
       You are not evil.        

344
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,632
         You are good,          
           Lil' Bulb.           

345
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,668
             Good.              

346
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,391
           You cannot           
      get rid of the Bin.       

347
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,627
     You may think they're      
     crackpots and weirdos,     

348
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,629
      but they're the ones      
      who push innovation,      

349
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,967
    and creativity, and spur    
   this company ever forward.   

350
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,138
   Just a little malfunction.   

351
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,807
            Definitely not evil.

352
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,809
Look, they're all mad as loons, 
and if you fire them,           

353
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,178
they're definitely              
going to seek revenge.          

354
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,813
        All in favor of         
        keeping the Bin         

355
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,015
       and everyone in it       
   far away from our offices.   

356
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,250
           ALL: Aye!            

357
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,421
                   No!!         

358
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,594
            Come on!            

359
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,602
          ( panting )           

360
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,206
    No. No, no, no, no, no!     

361
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,408
       Mine, mine. Wait!        
       Wait, wait, mine!        

362
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
           Of course.           

363
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,682
          Book throw,           
          book throw.           

364
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,117
                 Throwing books.

365
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,618
          This is our last book.

366
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,087
                  Make it count.

367
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,788
             What are you doing?

368
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,024
     Don't come any closer,     
      or the book gets it.      

369
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,393
         I will crease          
       this corner, man,        

370
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,794
          so back off.          

371
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,896
                   Tell me about
                   my mom.      

372
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,765
Why don't you                   
see for yourself?               

373
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,634
          This is it.           
          This is it!           

374
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,770
           This is...           

375
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,171
            nothing.            

376
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,775
             Wait. I've seen    
             that number before.

377
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,877
                      Follow me.

378
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,879
          Just a dime,          
          just a dime.          

379
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,648
         Oh, a quarter!         
       Wait, there it is.       

380
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,252
           Oh, I know           
        what went wrong.        

381
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,087
    This is a 75-watt bulb.     

382
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,956
     Lil' Bulb's only built     
            for 50.             

383
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,492
      Ha ha, he just went       
    a little mad with power.    

384
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,302
       Whoa, what the...        

385
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,173
 So you write me a check or...  

386
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,808
           ( growls )           

387
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,176
     A pleasure as always.      

388
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,677
      I'll be in my office      
        if you need me.         

389
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,546
           Please don't need me.

390
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,516
I don't understand.             

391
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,084
It should be here               
somewhere.                      

392
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,419
              Wait. These books.

393
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,921
                   They're all  
                   out of order.

394
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,323
Quackfaster's a lot             
of things, but                  
she's not sloppy.               

395
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,159
          QUACKFASTER:          
      <i> Use your training.</i>       

396
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,294
  <i> The most valuable knowledge</i>  
        <i> must be learned.</i>       

397
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,696
          Okay, how much of this
          is about us doing     
          your work for you?    

398
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,100
           <i> About 50%.</i>          

399
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,877
          Curse me kilts!       

400
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,915
       Come on, come on,        
         you got this!          

401
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,705
       Oh, there you are.       

402
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,740
( panting )                     
I can't catch my breath.        

403
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:10,975
           Don't be so dramatic.

404
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,743
           A little work        
           never killed anybody.

405
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,846
        Okay, here goes.        
              Ow!               

406
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,182
           What is up           
   with this stupid library?    

407
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,252
        COMPUTER VOICE:         
 <i> Duck family DNA recognized.</i>   

408
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,391
          Wow!                  

409
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,866
             Mom...             

410
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,902
      Why would this stuff      
           be hidden?           

411
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,871
      - I gotta show            
      Huey and Louie.           
      - Wait. What's this?      

412
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,874
  DEWEY: "Scrooge, I've taken   
      the Spear of Selene.      

413
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,377
       I'm sorry. Della."       

414
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,913
Wait, what did she take?        
Why is she sorry?               

415
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,916
             Did she betray     
             your Uncle Scrooge?

416
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,786
We can't tell anyone            
about this until we             
find out what it means.         

417
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,889
          I'm proud of you, lad.

418
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,891
       You put in               
       a full day at the office.

419
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,860
                  I think you've
                  earned this.  

420
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,962
        You're giving me        
     your number-one dime?      

421
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,864
    It's not my lucky dime.     

422
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,966
      I never let my dime       
        out of my sight.        

423
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,234
          That was just a decoy.

424
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,036
       I'm not an idiot.        

425
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,638
         This place is          
       full of lunatics.        

426
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,806
          A dime sure means more

427
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,809
           when you have to work
           for it, eh, lad?     

428
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:23,781
     Maybe I'll get my own      
  velvet pillow for this baby.  

429
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,683
          Oh, hold up.          

430
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:32,023
           Noooooo!!            

431
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,926
      Gyro creates robot.       

432
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,628
     Robot gains free will.     

433
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,433
      Robot turns on Gyro.      

434
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,136
      Gyro controls robot.      

435
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,806
         Gyro is robot.
