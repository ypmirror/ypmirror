HUEY: Let's see.                

116
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,871
Can Do Attitude, check.         

117
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,107
Professional posture... check.  

118
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,242
Completed checklist, check.     

119
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,977
Wow, I can't believe            
we get to be interns            

120
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,946
at Waddle for Mark Beaks!       

121
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,815
       Yeah, I'm mostly doing it
       to show off this bad boy.

122
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,584
        -What is that?          
        -Oh, this?              

123
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,552
           It's my super serious
           business briefcase.  

124
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,054
                "What brilliant 
                business secrets

125
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,956
                    is he hiding
                    in there?"  

126
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,324
                    Who knows?! 

127
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,393
You can't open                  
the lock, can you?              

128
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,460
                    Nope.       

129
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,798
            Welcome to Waddle,  

130
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,134
            where imagination   
            and innovation      

131
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,636
            get married         
            and have babies!    

132
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,904
                    (beeps)     

133
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:06,905
        Digital high-five app,  

134
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,440
        so you never get        
        left hanging,           

135
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,275
        or, you know,           
        have to touch anyone.   

136
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,911
        Come, roll with Beaks.  

137
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,913
            Here are            
  the high-impact trampolines,  

138
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,315
  the low-impact trampolines,   

139
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,984
        and, of course,         
   the no-impact trampolines.   

140
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,752
    Those are fun.              

141
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,522
       Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!        

142
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,091
      Slides are the new stairs.

143
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,693
      Ha! That's actually       
          pretty cool!          

144
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,162
If, by cool, you mean           
statistically proven            

145
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,930
to increase                     
employee productivity.          

146
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:32,998
Huh! This guy.                  

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,366
            Oh, before you ask, 

148
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,867
                yeah, it's all  
                made of candy.  

149
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,169
                You're welcome. 

150
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,872
               Ooh, wow!        

151
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,641
            Who knew work       
            could be so awesome?

152
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,509
        Mark Beaks did. Blamo!  

153
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,446
    He talks the way            
    I want to live!             

154
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:50,048
        Here are your official  
        Waddle trainee beanies. 

155
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,383
       Congratulations, weenies!

156
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,719
    Oh, P.S., there's only space
        for one intern,         

157
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,721
    so one of you is going home 
       by the end of the day.   

158
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,889
        Cool? Cool. Beaks out!  

159
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,691
One internship?!                

160
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,893
Well, hehe, you didn't          
really want it anyway,          

161
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,062
so I'll just tell               
Mr. Beaks to give it to me.     

162
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,864
      Oh, no, no, no, no.       

163
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,065
  Sliding my way to billions?   

164
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,067
            Licking             
     other people's stuff?      

165
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,903
  It's everything I never knew  
        I always wanted!        

166
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,472
                    I am in!    

167
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,074
This is about more              
than just goofing around.       

168
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,509
                        Whee!   

169
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,877
    You're doing it wrong.      

170
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,245
    This is supposed to be      
    efficient, not fun.         

171
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,246
    (unenthused) Whee.          

172
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,915
    Ha! I'm about to be         
        a billionaire!          

173
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,084
     And when Scrooge tries     
      to follow me online,      

174
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,036
        I'll block him.         

175
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:29,987
    Man, you are killing it     
        today, Beaks!           

176
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,523
GUARD (muffled): Sir,           
you can't go in there!          

177
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,025
   (blows landing, groaning)    

178
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,026
Stop right there!               

179
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,995
           Ooh, neat!           

180
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,231
            -(beeps)            
           -(groans)            

181
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,069
      Mr. Beaks, allow me       
      to introduce myself.      

182
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,739
  Falcon Graves, professional   
    corporate saboteur and--    

183
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,942
Professional is right, man!     
That suit game is on point.     

184
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,179
    (sighs) As I was saying,    
    unfortunately for you,      

185
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:58,083
    I've been hired to steal    
  your coveted Project Tahdah.  

186
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,551
        -(phone clicks)         
      -What are you doing?      

187
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,887
I'm just updating               
my status to "hostage."         

188
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,489
Feel like this could be huge    
for my online presence.         

189
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,059
Oh, uh, were you not done       
with your speech?               

190
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,394
            Get me to Research  
            & Development.      

191
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,962
        Hey, let him go. Aah!   

192
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,098
                Immediately.    

193
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,601
     [techno music playing]     

194
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,570
Turn that nonsense off!         

195
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,039
            I already tried.    
            It's impossible.    

196
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,774
              [beeps]           

197
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,976
Well, how was I supposed        
to know the "On" button         

198
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,978
and the "Off" button            
were the same button?           

199
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,847
        Did you sleep here      
           last night?          

200
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,416
      Don't be ridiculous.      

201
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,152
    Who can sleep when you're   
    plotting against a nemesis? 

202
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:38,156
That cocky Mark Beaks           
may be the only man I hate      
as much as you!                 

203
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,591
            I know the feeling. 

204
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:42,494
So now I propose                
we get rid of him.              

205
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,134
            Do we really need   
            a slideshow?        

206
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,636
   Ha! Sweet, naive Scroogy.    

207
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,606
   Leave the devious planning   
     to the professionals.      

208
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,576
           You're in            
     my world now, McDuck.      

209
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,111
        Yeah, all right.        
        Show me what you've got.

210
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,482
No, you're actually             
on my side of the room.         

211
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,288
Ooh, task lists!                
This is a place of dreams!      

212
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,090
Oh, I don't know, Dewey,        
this looks like                 

213
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,025
a whole bunch of boring         
business-guy tasks.             

214
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,027
You're not really equipped      
to handle them, so...           

215
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,497
        And lose this internship
        to you? No way!         

216
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,866
        This place              
        has free snow cones!    

217
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:24,035
            Free snow cones!    

218
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,070
    (beeps)                     

219
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,373
        (phone ringing)         

220
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,108
 Thank you for calling Waddle.  
          Please hold.          

221
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,377
 Thank you for calling Waddle.  
   Please hold. Please hold.    

222
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,679
        -Waddle.                
        -DEWEY: Yup, yeah, no.  
         I totally get it.      

223
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,448
            I hate talking      
            on the phone, too,  

224
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,683
            so that's why       
            I kick my feet up,  
            I'm leaning back... 

225
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,885
Who are you talking to?         

226
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:45,023
    Oh, uh...                   
    Business-man-ning-ton-son?  

227
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,359
          -(dial tone)          
   -Oh, you just missed him!    

228
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,673
    Okay. One sandwich cut      
    diagonally with no crusts,  

229
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,475
    no pickles, but yes         
    to pickles on the side,     

230
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,243
    so you can decide           
    which pickles to use.       

231
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,712
I got pizza!                    
Everybody loves pizza!          

232
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,381
  (chanting) New guy! New guy!  

233
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,383
         But I'm also           
         the new guy...         

234
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,386
    There's the high-impact     
        trampolines,            

235
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,221
  the low-impact trampolines... 

236
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,925
Mr. Beaks, is the tour          
really necessary?               

237
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,560
            Listen, Graves,     
            if we're gonna keep 

238
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,696
   this hostage stuff on the DL,
   I gotta act natural.         

239
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,997
    (louder) And naturally,     

240
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,933
I give tours                    
of my awesome company!          

241
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,501
            Must I wear the hat?

242
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,103
You bet. All trainees           
gotta wear the hat,             

243
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,873
          and you are           
       a trainee, right?        

244
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,708
              Boop!             

245
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,109
Complimentary snow cone?        

246
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,111
Oops, you dropped it.           
Here's another.                 

247
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,446
How 'bout blueberry?            

248
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,782
Ah, good call, that one         
stains your mouth forever.      

249
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,383
        -Look, see? Ahh...      
        -You do realize         

250
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,453
        you're in quite a lot   
        of danger right now.    

251
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,690
I know! I'm gonna be            
trending online for days!       

252
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,425
Hostage selfie!                 

253
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,296
Backup phones.                  

254
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,197
                (groans)        

255
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,702
Excuse me, Mr. Beaks.           

256
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,470
         I just tagged          
       us together. 'Sup?       

257
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,106
Mr. Beaks, here's               
my completed, color-coded,      

258
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,141
and categorized checklist.      

259
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,910
I even made                     
some categories for--           

260
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,712
                I ordered       
                everybody pizza.

261
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:17,282
So who would you say            
is in the lead                  
for the internship?             

262
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,118
            Oh, uh,             
      I guess you're tied.      

263
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,387
     -(techno music plays)      
  -Oh, mandatory dance break!   

264
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,289
             Whoo-whoo!         

265
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,993
      Pew pew! Chicka-pew!      

266
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,328
     And, lo, he shall pay      
       for his arrogance        

267
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,430
          as his world          
      crumbles around him       

268
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,132
   and Beaks will rue the day   

269
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,235
       he heard the name        
      Flintheart Glomgold!      

270
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,270
      -(thunder crashing)       
      -(maniacal laughter)      

271
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,572
           (startles)           

272
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,108
Oh, and Scrooge McDuck,         
I guess.                        

273
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,076
          (yawns)               
          Ooh, are you finished?

274
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,779
What? Every evil plot starts    

275
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,315
with a "Declaration             
of Hatred" speech.              

276
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,950
Oh, you have                    
so much to learn.               

277
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:55,587
        Great. Now, can we talk 
        about the actual plan?  

278
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,355
I thought you'd never ask!      

279
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,958
            I asked             
            several hours ago!  

280
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,493
    Behold.                     

281
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,495
Our scheme to destroy Beaks     

282
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,764
begins with an invitation       

283
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,699
to a Billionaires' Convention   
on a yacht.                     

284
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,435
We'll tell him we're going,     
but then we won't show!         

285
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,536
First slam!                     

286
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,804
            Seems unnecessary,  

287
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,040
            especially the part 
            about the yacht.    

288
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,976
Emotionally devastated,         
Beaks will seek solace          

289
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,378
and drown his sorrows           
at the buffet.                  

290
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,647
        A yacht and a buffet    
        for one person?         

291
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,182
        I'm not paying for that.

292
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,151
Fine. We'll use                 
my yacht.                       

293
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:29,854
Now, distracted                 
by delicious shrimp,            

294
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,224
Beaks won't realize he's being  
sailed into an active volcano,  

295
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,726
where it'll get so hot          

296
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,461
he'll jump                      
into the yacht's pool,          

297
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,964
which, unbeknownst to him,      
will be filled with sharks!     

298
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,399
        Where did               
        the sharks come from?   

299
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,034
I've got a great shark guy.     

300
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,203
Beaks will be so terrified      
by the sharks,                  

301
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,971
he'll forget                    
he's in a volcano               

302
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,908
and jump blindly                
into the lava!                  

303
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,911
All while we watch              
from a bridge above.            

304
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,813
        Wait, wait, I though    
        we wanted to boot him   

305
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,347
        out of our club,        
        not kill him!           

306
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,850
    Although you have tried     
    to kill me countless times, 

307
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,419
        which usually ends up   
        being more annoying     
        than deadly.            

308
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,921
That's right,                   
I'm a genius.                   

309
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,189
Now, pay attention,             

310
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,725
'cause this is where            
it gets complicated.            

311
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,059
                    Ooh...

 your most important task yet.  

314

          Now, I want           
      almond-infused foam,

          understood?           

318
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,773
Coffee

          where it is!

       XL Waddle T-shirt,       

322
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,123
   a bunch of Waddle yo-yos,    
     and a Waddle jetpack.

       It's super broken.

  I'm sorry, why am I getting   

326

    my 2:15 coffee at 2:14?     

327
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,899
     I didn't get an email      
      about it moving up.

     an almost-billionaire      

330

   at random times of the day

Mr. Beaks, I have               
your 2:15 coffee                
at exactly 2:15.                

334
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,119
          Ooh, yummy!           
      Man, things got real      

335
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,288
          for a second          
       back there, right?       

336
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,390
                How is this     
                not very real?  

337
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,159
       Yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,394
Huey, sir.                      

340
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,798
      Ooh, don't love it.       

341
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:25,570
   How about brand-new Waddle   
          intern Huey!          

342
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,905
                          Ha-ha!

343
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,407
Achieve dream. Check.           

344
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:34,746
    (huffs) Now, can we finally 
    get to Project Tahdah?      

345
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,849
Whoa, is that                   
an ironically fancy briefcase   

346
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,584
in my super-chill               
work environment?               

347
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,352
                Uh... yes.      

348
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,854
What's going on in there,       

349
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,522
like, brilliant                 
business secrets?               

350
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,857
                    You know it!

351
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,992
Very chill.                     
Oh, I like how you roll!        

352
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,361
You are my new Vice President   
of Fancy Business.              

353
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,996
Intern, you report              
to him now. Boom.               

354
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,131
Beaks out!                      

355
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,365
            -What?!             
            -Yes!               

356
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,100
                Faked it,       
                maked it!       

357
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,503
    I didn't even know this was 
    my life's dream until today.

358
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,773
But-- but-- how did I win       
and still lose?                 

359
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,776
I worked so hard                
and had so many                 
completed checklists.           

360
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,444
Do you need me                  
to get a briefcase?             

361
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,012
'Cause I can go get one         
and then become                 

362
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,614
the Vice President              
of Being Chill!                 

363
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,383
'Cause I'm chill.               
I'm straight chilling.          

364
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,852
Like a villain, even!           

365
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,453
          Oh, no, Huey's broken.

366
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:19,457
Or I could be Chief Manager     
of Being Broken!                

367
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,159
         'Cause anyone          
     can just be anything!      

368
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,460
        Look at me, everybody,  

369
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,562
        now I'm the Duke        
        of Making a Mess!       

370
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,830
            (growling)          

371
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,166
    Watch out for the Duke!     

372
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,701
        Mr. Beaks,              
    is everything okay?         

373
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,970
            Uh, this again.     
            (cracks knuckles)   

374
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:35,373
   (blows landing, grunting)    

375
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,708
 Oh, I missed that last punch.  

376
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,476
   Could you prop him back up   
        and do it again?        

377
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,413
No more games.                  
You're all my captives now.     

378
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:46,384
You, Vice President,            
take me to Project Tahdah!      

379
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,052
    Yes, of course. Sure.       

380
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,754
        Um...                   

381
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,824
                Seriously?      
                It's that way.  

382
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,559
It's that way.                  
Of course it's that way.        

383
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,595
Sorry, it's my first day,       
but, eh, let's go this way.     

384
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,330
     Huh!                       

385
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,504
    Welcome to the cutting edge 
    of the latest technology.   

386
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,906
      See that in the air?      
         What is that?          

387
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:08,907
       It's called magic!       

388
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,608
Open the vault!                 

389
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,844
             -Now!              
        -Ugh, fine! I'll        

390
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,513
  (imitating Graves) "finally   
  take you to Project Tahdah."  

391
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,514
          Blech! Ugh.           

392
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,117
           -(beeping)           
      -(tumblers clicking)      

393
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,786
                Menacing man,   
                small children, 

394
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,856
      prepare yourselves        
      for my greatest invention.

395
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,324
           (whirring)           

396
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,528
         What? Nothing?         

397
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,699
  Everything you think it is,   
 and nothing you're expecting!  

398
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,634
           You got              
   the nothing part right.      

399
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,870
So, Project Tahdah              
is a hoax?                      

400
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,772
            Tahdah!             

401
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,573
          I build hype          
      for a fake product,       

402
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,242
        everyone invests        
         in my company,         

403
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,444
   kablam, I'm a billionaire!   

404
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,280
      This is ridiculous.       
    I'm calling my employer.    

405
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,482
           -(dialing)           
           -(ringing)           

406
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,650
                   Go for Beaks.

407
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,618
                        (growls)

408
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,486
You've got to be kidding me!    

409
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,790
Why would you hire me to steal  
something that doesn't exist?   

410
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,926
       So he gets to say        
   Project Tahdah was stolen,   

411
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,329
       but he still keeps       
           the money!           

412
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,964
            See? Fancy Business 
            gets it.            

413
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,967
        Why actually put in     
        the hard work           
        of inventing something  

414
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,569
        when I can just tell    
        everybody I did?        

415
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,937
            Fake it till you    
            make it, right?     

416
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,105
                (chimes)        

417
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,507
       And become a billionaire!

418
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,843
          Ba-bam!               
          Just crossed the mark.

419
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,478
          Aw, count them zeroes!

420
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,913
            One, two, three,    
            four, five--        

421
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,481
            Bah, I'm bored.     
            You get it.         

422
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,583
            And it's all thanks 
            to you, bud.        

423
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,585
                  Get over here,
                  Selfington!   

424
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,153
              (growls)          

425
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,624
I can't believe                 
I looked up to you.             

426
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,861
  You and your whole company    
  are as fake as Project Tahdah.

427
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,163
            Maybe, but the money
            and the buzz        

428
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,165
            are very, very real.

429
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,034
            I just got          
            so many followers!  

430
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,702
             -Pah!              
 -Gravesy, there's a helicopter 

431
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:45,670
            waiting for you     
            on the roof.        

432
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,838
            You know what?      
            Keep the beanie.    

433
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,640
I do not like being lied to!    

434
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,510
    Oh, this is fun.            
    Where we going?             

435
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,511
                To the roof...  

436
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,714
    So I can toss you off it!   

437
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,884
    Oh! Mwah, mwah, mwah.       

438
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:03,388
    Who loves being a pawn      
    in my twisted evil plots?   

439
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,690
    You! Yes, you do!           

440
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,292
            Why on earth should 
            we ever need this?  

441
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,228
Well, how else is Beaks         
going to know                   

442
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,030
he's at the Annual              
Carrot Festival?!               

443
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,965
You clearly didn't              
understand the plan.            

444
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,200
Let's start                     
from the beginning.             

445
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,603
         -Behold, our--         
              -No!              

446
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,242
     "Backstabbing Scrooge,     
         version 3..."          

447
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,376
          What's this?          

448
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,911
Oh, i-it's nothing.             

449
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,756
     This whole thing           
     is a trap for me, isn't it?

450
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,725
What?! No...                    

451
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:41,926
Of course not.                  

452
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,430
Your new best friend            
would never...                  

453
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,597
No, stay right there.           

454
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,904
Uh, heh, thank goodness         
you moved at the last minute,   

455
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,706
or you would've been            
destroyed by the axe.           

456
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,775
        How long have you       
        been planning that one? 

457
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:58,576
        More than six months?   

458
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,911
I don't want to say.            

459
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,246
            I can't believe     
            I wasted a whole day

460
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,282
          obsessing over someone
          I don't like,         

461
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,917
            and it nearly       
            got me killed!      

462
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,453
       Who am I, you? Ugh!      

463
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,121
            Have fun            
     with your new nemesis.     

464
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,722
   I'm gonna go beat you both   

465
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,624
       by actually being        
     a better billionaire.      

466
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,294
      (techno music plays)      

467
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,764
   BEAKS (narrating): "Help.    
   Project Tahdah was stolen    

468
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,533
       and now I'm going        
  to be tossed off the roof."   

469
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,402
  Oh, should I add a sad face,  
      or is that too much?      

470
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,803
              (growls)          

471
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,306
          Oh, ground.           

472
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,608
Dude, not cool!                 

473
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,610
-That's my last backup phone!   
            -Yes!               

474
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,878
         (exclamations          
     from Beaks and Graves)     

475
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,713
We've gotta save Beaks.         

476
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,982
Right? I mean,                  
he's the worst,                 

477
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,650
but it's                        
the right thing to do.          

478
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,086
        Why? I'm sure           
        your biggest,           
        favorite friend         

479
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,655
        will just fake          
        his way through it      
        like everything else.   

480
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,625
Okay, first off,                
that's not what BFF stands for. 

481
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,628
And secondly, guys like him,    
guys like me,                   

482
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,997
we have to put on               
a show and fake it              

483
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,900
because smart guys like you     
are so good at making it.       

484
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,635
We don't need this.             

485
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,104
What we need                    
is a checklist.                 

486
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,840
In fact, here's a checklist     
for how to get through this.    

487
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,610
One, get a plan.                
Two, ask Huey for a plan.       

488
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,145
Three, do you have              
a plan yet?                     

489
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,614
'Cause honestly I don't know    
how checklists work!            

490
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:10,982
                I got it.       

491
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,617
              HUEY: Hey, Graves,
              over here!        

492
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,784
        DEWEY: Wha?!            

493
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,052
        This is dumb.           
        I hate this plan.       

494
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,790
            Ha-ha, I win!       
            Oh, gross!          

495
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,493
          Your dumb fingerprints
          smudged my screen.    

496
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,362
                   (huffs)      

497
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,930
               Now, go be Dewey.

498
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,833
             Aaah!              

499
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,700
             Take this!         

500
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,135
       And all of these!        

501
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,505
               (grunting)       

502
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,608
    Time out!                   

503
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,310
We have to take off             
these stupid hats.              

504
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,444
It's humiliating.               

505
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,848
                Tight end!      

506
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,283
              Nyah!             

507
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,817
        Dewey, whatever you do, 

508
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,620
        do not tell Graves      
        what's in the briefcase!

509
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,789
       What<i> is</i> in the briefcase?

510
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,724
Oh, this briefcase?             

511
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,160
Just a bunch of fancy business  
secrets, very hush-hush.        

512
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,195
You see the lock?               

513
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,362
        Give me that.           

514
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,633
            What's the code?    

515
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,735
           -Try 1111.           
              -No.              

516
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,705
         -Mmkay, 2222?          
              -No.              

517
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,575
            Right,              
            of course not. 3333.

518
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,176
Oh, now you're                  
just guessing.                  

519
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,844
            Have you tried      
            the factory default?

520
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,681
Of course I have--              
Oh...kay.                       

521
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,382
      (slowed-down scream)      

522
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,819
             Doink. Ah.         

523
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,522
    Oh, that's it, I'm done!    

524
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:27,858
    And I'm untagging myself    
    from all those photos!      

525
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,162
(laughs) That's                 
gotta be $20 million!           

526
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,064
Where did you get               
a briefcase full of money?      

527
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,399
    Next to the suit of armor   
    in the Billionaires' Club.  

528
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,934
    That place needs            
    better security.            

529
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:37,935
            'Sup over here?     

530
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,837
        Uh, we saved your life. 

531
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,039
    Right. Hey, so obviously    
    I have to fire you guys     

532
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,908
    because you know the secret 
    of Project Tahdah,          

533
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,077
    and if you tell anybody     
    I'll just say you're lying  

534
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,512
    because you're mad I        
    fired you. Cool? Cool-cool. 

535
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,918
"My face looks                  
like a butt."                   

536
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
And... sent.                    

537
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,055
            Seriously, that's   
            your big plan?      

538
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,124
            Who even cares      
            about what--        

539
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,859
    It already has 1,000 likes! 

540
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,695
        What? No! No!           
        I can't delete it now!  

541
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,130
                Give it back!   
                Give it back!   

542
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,466
       (opera aria plays)       

543
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:14,538
        (slowed-down scream)    

544
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:34,892
      Hah! Me and my phone      
           are fine!            

545
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,295
  (laughs) We totally crushed   
           that fall!           

546
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,332
                        Aw, man!

547
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:43,067
Letter for billionaire          
Mark Beaks.                     

548
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,201
                Aha, that's me! 

549
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:50,641
Oh, an invite                   
to a Billionaires' Convention   
on a yacht.                     

550
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,844
          Awesometown,          
       population Beaks.        

551
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:57,581
       I still get to be        
    a Duckburg billionaire.     

552
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,818
         And everything         
      that comes with it.       

553
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,821
     Get the sharks ready.      

554
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,856
      -(thunder crashing)       
      -(maniacal laughter)
