<i>Morning in Ponyville shines</i>

<i>And I know
For absolute certain</i>

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,210
<i>That everything
Is certainly fine</i>

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,660
<i>There's the mayor en route
To her office</i>

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,460
<i>There's the sofa clerk
Selling some quills</i>

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,380
Morning, kid!

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
<i>My Ponyville
Is so gentle and still</i>

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,660
<i>Can things ever go wrong?
I don't think that they will</i>

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,130
<i>Morning in Ponyville shimmers</i>

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,560
<i>Morning in Ponyville shines</i>

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,990
<i>And I know
For absolute certain</i>

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,390
<i>That everything is certainly...</i>

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,260
Rainbow Dash! That's not funny!

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,940
Terribly sorry, darling.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,110
I'm afraid I'm not good
with the thundery ones.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,080
Something tells me
everything is not going to be fine!

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,170
What are you doing?
What happened to your cutie mark?

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,120
Whatever do you mean, Twilight?

23
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,420
I'm simply doing what I've done
since the day it first appeared.

24
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,720
Does my sky look fabulous
or what?

25
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,470
Too last season?

26
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,270
Where is Rainbow Dash?
Why isn't she handling this?

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,780
I still don't know
what you had to wake me up for.

28
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,060
I love sleeping in the rain.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,040
It's not about the weather, Spike.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,270
Rarity had Rainbow Dash's cutie mark
and said this was Rainbow Dash's cottage.

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,310
Something strange is going on.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,390
Hey, guys.

33
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,310
Rainbow Dash!
Why is Rarity doing your job?

34
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,100
And what in Equestria is going on in...

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,730
here?!

36
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,300
<i>These animals don't listen
No, not one little bit</i>

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,380
<i>They run around out of control
And throw their hissy fits</i>

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,170
<i>It's up to me to stop them
'Cause plainly you can see</i>

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,120
<i>It's got to be my destiny</i>

40
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>And it's what
My cutie mark is telling me</i>

41
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,430
<i>I try to keep them laughing
Put a smile upon their face</i>

42
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,610
<i>But no matter what I try
It seems a bit of a disgrace</i>

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,550
<i>I have to entertain them
It's there for all to see</i>

44
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,950
<i>It's got to be my destiny</i>

45
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,270
<i>And it's what
My cutie mark is telling me</i>

46
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,010
<i>I don't care much for pickin' fruit
And plowin' fields ain't such a hoot</i>

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,800
<i>No matter what I try
I cannot fix this busted water chute!</i>

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,850
<i>I've got so many chores to do
It's no fun being me</i>

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,750
<i>But it has to be my destiny</i>

50
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,090
<i>'Cause it's what
My cutie mark is telling me</i>

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,800
<i>Lookie here at what I made
I think that it's a dress</i>

52
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,410
<i>I know it doesn't look like much
I'm under some distress</i>

53
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,240
<i>Could y'all give me a hand here
And help me fix this mess?</i>

54
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,820
<i>My destiny is not pretty</i>

55
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,680
<i>But it's what
My cutie mark is tellin' me</i>

56
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,650
<i>I'm in love with weather patterns
But the others have concerns</i>

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,100
<i>For I just gave them frostbite
Over-top of their sunburns</i>

58
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,660
<i>I have to keep on trying
For everyone can see</i>

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,950
<i>It's got to be</i>

60
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,050
<i>My destiny</i>

61
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,300
<i>And it's what my cutie mark</i>

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,070
<i>It's what my cutie mark</i>

63
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,800
<i>Yes, it's what
My cutie mark is telling me!</i>

64
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,700
This is bad.
This is very, very bad!

65
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,360
What's going on?
Why is this happening?!

66
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,270
Last night when you were taking
one of your seven-hour bubble baths,

67
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,120
<i>I got a special delivery
from the princess.</i>

68
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,370
Dear Twilight Sparkle,

69
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,720
The spell contained
on the last page of this book

70
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,470
is Star Swirl the Bearded's
secret unfinished masterpiece.

71
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,550
He was never able to get it right,
and thus abandoned it.

72
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,420
I believe you are the only pony
who can understand and rewrite it.

73
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,340
Princess Celestia.

74
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,410
From one to another,
another to one.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,850
A mark of one's destiny
singled out alone, fulfilled.

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,100
That doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't even rhyme!

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,440
<i>I cast the spell
so I could find out what it was.</i>

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,570
<i>But nothing seemed to happen.</i>

79
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,440
But now I know something did happen.

80
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,020
The spell has changed
the Elements of Harmony!

81
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,040
That must be why
their cutie marks are all wrong!

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,430
So just cast a counter-spell
to switch them back!

83
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,110
There is no counter-spell!

84
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,340
What about that memory spell you used
to fix everypony when Discord was here?

85
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,110
It's not their memories, Spike.

86
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,400
It's their true selves
that have been altered!

87
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,080
- Zecora's cure for the Cutie Pox?
- That won't work either...

88
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,650
Well, maybe it won't be so bad.

89
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,010
Maybe our friends will grow
to like their new lives?

90
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,300
No Spike. They're not
who they are meant to be anymore.

91
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,710
Their destinies are now changed.

92
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,710
And it's all my fault...

93
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,870
<i>I have to find a way</i>

94
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,460
<i>To make this all okay</i>

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,170
<i>I can't believe this small mistake</i>

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,380
<i>Could've caused so much heartache</i>

97
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,500
<i>Oh why</i>

98
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,510
<i>Oh why</i>

99
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,870
<i>Losing promise</i>

100
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,270
<i>I don't know what to do</i>

101
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,660
<i>Seeking answers</i>

102
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:54,400
<i>I fear I won't get through to you</i>

103
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,410
<i>Oh why</i>

104
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,790
<i>Oh why</i>

105
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,360
Oh, Spike, what have I done?

106
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,320
Aw, come on, Twilight,
you'll figure out a way to fix this.

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,610
These are your friends.

108
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,620
You're right, Spike.

109
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,790
And they mean more to me
than anything.

110
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,710
My friends...

111
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,420
Twilight?
Are you alright?

112
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,430
I've got it! I know what to do!

113
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,340
You do?

114
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,410
I may not be able
to remind them of who they are,

115
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,750
but I can show them
what they mean to each other.

116
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,280
They'll find the part of themselves
that's been lost so they can

117
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,750
help the friend
they care about so much!

118
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,620
Come on, Spike!

119
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,260
Fluttershy, wait!

120
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,740
- Oh... Hey, Twilight...
- Where are you going?

121
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,700
I'm moving back to Cloudsdale.

122
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,450
I don't know what's wrong,
but I can't seem to make anypony laugh.

123
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,110
Before you go,

124
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,190
I was wondering if you might
be willing to help Rainbow Dash.

125
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,670
She's really struggling
with her animals.

126
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,130
But I don't really know
anything about animals...

127
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,630
But you do know something
about Rainbow Dash.

128
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,230
I know
that she's a true friend,

129
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,630
and I'll do
anything I can to help her!

130
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,990
Rainbow Dash!

131
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,580
I'm in here! Help!
I'm trapped!

132
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,200
Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do
some sort of spell to get her out?

133
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,230
No.

134
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,880
Fluttershy,
you're the only one who can help!

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,490
Rainbow Dash needs you!

136
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,610
Um... Hello?

137
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,530
Little... woodland creatures?

138
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,630
I know that
you're all very upset,

139
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,970
and feel like giving
Rainbow Dash a hard time,

140
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,310
but we'd all really appreciate it
if you'd calm down and, um,

141
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,490
maybe rest for a bit?

142
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,370
Oh! Uh... look!

143
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,240
Here's some nice, juicy leaves
for you to munch on.

144
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,470
And some crunchy,
munchy acorns too.

145
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,830
Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break
and have a little snack?

146
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,040
Aw, look at that. I guess you were
all just cranky because you were hungry.

147
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,250
Oh, you are very welcome,
little friends.

148
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,210
Goodness, it's like
I can understand them!

149
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,810
I... I feel strange, like...

150
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,830
like this is what I'm meant to do,
like this is who I am!

151
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,670
My destiny!

152
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,980
Wha... what happened?

153
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,500
Fluttershy, look!
Your cutie mark!

154
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,210
It worked!
It worked!

Or, maybe I'm still having it.

184

Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about
to lose the apple farm.

185
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,100
We need Applejack's help!

186

Well we can't let that happen,
now can we?

what's next?

197
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,260
The townspeople are furious,
we need the old Pinkie Pie back.

198
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,420
I'm on it, I know just the thing.

<i>The townspeople need you

216
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,910
What happened?

217
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,220
Hello? Where am I?
What is this place?

218
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,860
Congratulations, Twilight.
I knew you could do it.

219
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,890
Princess! I don't understand.
What did I do?

220
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,250
You did something today
that's never been done before.

221
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,570
Something even a great unicorn like
Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do.

222
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,460
Because he did not understand
friendship like you do.

223
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,750
The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville
have taught you well.

224
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,820
You have proven that you're ready,
Twilight.

225
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,920
Ready? Ready for what?

226
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,570
<i>You've come such a long, long way</i>

227
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,980

228
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,180
<i>To see how you might grow</i>

229
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,740
<i>To see what you might do</i>

230
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,490
<i>To see what you've been through</i>

231
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:48,250
<i>And all the ways
You've made me proud of you</i>

232
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,970
<i>It's time now

233
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:04,560
<i>You've grown up
And your new life has begun</i>

234
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,180
<i>To go where you will go</i>

235
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,440
<i>To see what you will see</i>

236
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
<i>To find what you will be</i>

237
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,520
<i>For it's time for you</i>

238
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,910
<i>To fulfill your destiny</i>

239
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,480
Twilight...? Is that you?

240
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,320
I... I've never seen
anything like it!

241
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,590
Twilight's got wings! Awesome!

242
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,950
A new flying buddy!

243
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,240
Why, you've become an alicorn.
I didn't even know that was possible.

244
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,820
Alicorn party!

245
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,290
Wow... you look just like a princess!

246
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,470
That's because she is a princess.

247
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,460
Hold on a second!

248
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,990
A princess?

249
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,250
Since you've come to Ponyville,

250
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,410
you've displayed the charity, compassion,
devotion, integrity, optimism,

251
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,290
and of course,
the leadership of a true princess.

252
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,370
But... does this mean
I won't be your student anymore?

253
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,550
Not in the same way as before.

254
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,700
I'll still be here to help and guide you,
but we're all your students now, too.

255
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,140
You are an inspiration to us all,
Twilight.

256
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,810
But... what do I do now?

257
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,700
Is there a book about
being a princess I should read?

258
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,520
There will be time
for all of that later.

259
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,070
We are gathered here today
in celebration of a momentous occasion.

260
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,480
My most faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle,

261
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,470
has done many extraordinary things
since she's lived in Ponyville.

262
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,420
She even helped reunite me
with my sister, Princess Luna.

263
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,430
But today, Twilight Sparkle
did something extraordinary.

264
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,500
She created new magic,

265
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,060
proving without a doubt
that she is ready

266
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,620
to be crowned
Equestria's newest princess.

267
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,910
Fillies and gentlecolts,
may I present for the very first time,

268
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,240
Princess Twilight Sparkle!

269
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,910
<i>Thou Princess Twilight cometh</i>

270
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,430
<i>Behold, behold</i>

271
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,420
<i>A Princess here before us</i>

272
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:19,340
<i>Behold, behold, behold</i>

273
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,250

274
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,630
<i>The Princess Twilight cometh</i>

275
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,300
<i>Behold, behold
(behold, behold)</i>

276
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,210
<i>The Princess is
(the Princess is)</i>

277
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,330
<i>Here!</i>

278
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,120
Say something, Princess.

279
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,890
A little while ago,

280
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,300
my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia
sent me to live in Ponyville.

281
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,760
She sent me to study friendship,

282
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,220
which is something
I didn't really care much about.

283
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,810
But now, on a day like today,
I can honestly say

284
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,090
I wouldn't be standing here
if it weren't for the friendships

285
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,220
I've made with all of you.

286
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,190
Each one of you taught me something
about friendship, and for that,

287
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,520
I will always be grateful.

288
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,130
Today, I consider myself
the luckiest pony in Equestria.

289
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,430
Thank you, friends.
Thank you, everypony!

290
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,570
Twilight! I'm so proud of you!

291
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,590
Are you crying?

292
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,550
Of course not,
it's... it's liquid pride.

293
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,510
Totally different thing!

294
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,030
Way to go, Princess!

295
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,350
Best coronation day ever!

296
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,390
- We love you, Twilight.
- I love you too, girls!
