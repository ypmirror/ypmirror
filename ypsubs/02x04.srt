1
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:10,220
Come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late
for the Nightmare Night Festival.

2
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:14,318
Huh?

3
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:16,531
Are you...

4
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:20,602
...that one creaky grandpa
from Ponyville Retirement Village?

5
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:22,975
I'm Star Swirl the Bearded.

6
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:26,751
Father of the omnimorphic spell?

7
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:31,615
Did you even read that book I gave you
about obscure unicorn history?

8
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:32,764
Um...

9
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:34,679
That sounds important!

10
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:42,381
<i>Nightmare Night! What a fright!
Give us something sweet to bite!</i>

11
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:47,404
Hi, everypony. Great costumes.

12
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:49,212
Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.

13
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:52,581
I should have been
asleep five hours ago.

14
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:06,108
Pipsqueak the Pirate, at your service.
It's my very first Nightmare Night.

15
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,985
Since you moved here from Trottingham?

16
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:11,909
No. My very first Nightmare Night ever!

17
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,560
Enough chitchat! Time is candy!

18
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:17,116
Pinkie Pie, aren't you
a little old for this?

19
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:19,191
Too old for free candy?

20
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:20,755
Never!

21
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:28,582
Do you like it?

22
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,516
Yeah! Great costume, Twilight.

23
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:34,045
Oh, you make a fantastic weirdo clown.

24
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,863
A clown?!

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,197
Look at the borders on these robes.

26
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:42,832
These are hoof-stitched!

27
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,479
It's a great costume.

28
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,362
...grandpa.

29
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:32,147
Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most
important conjurer of the pre-classical era.

30
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:37,778
He created more than two hundred spells.

31
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:41,560
He even has a shelf in the Canterlot
library of magic named after him.

32
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:46,671
Maybe I should start up a pony group
to teach ponies of our history.

33
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:49,671
I bet everypony would love it.
Don't you, Spike?

34
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,432
I love it.

35
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:55,696
Hey, look. We're here already.

36
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:57,279
Should we get something to eat?

37
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,731
Twilight! Twilight! Look at our haul!

38
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:03,074
Can you believe it?

39
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:09,563
And then we went to Cheerilee's house
and we got a bunch more goodies.

40
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,991
-Didn't we, Pip?
-Sure did!

41
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,729
And then we had to stop and wait
for Granny Smith and...

42
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:20,090
Rainbow Dash! That wasn't very nice.

43
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:23,987
Lighten up, old-timer. This is
the best night of the year for pranks.

44
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:25,759
Look what you did to Spike.

45
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,888
Aw, it's all in good fun.

46
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,806
Oh! Oh! There's another group over there!

47
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,982
Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack.

48
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:50,467
Howdy, Spike. Hey, Twilight.
Nice costume.

49
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,369
Thanks! I'm a dragon.

50
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,179
She means me, Spike.

51
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,483
With that beard, I reckon you're
some sorta country music singer.

52
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,210
While y'all are here, you feel like
bobbin' for an apple?

53
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:09,198
Thank you, everypony.

54
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,344
And welcome to
the Nightmare Night Festival.

55
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,630
Now, all the little ponies, who
have been out collecting sweets...

56
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:21,870
...should follow our friend Zecora
to hear the legend of...

57
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:24,686
Nightmare Moooon!

58
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:30,566
Spooky voice might work better
if she wasn't dressed like that.

59
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:43,444
Follow me and very soon
You'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon.

60
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:50,707
Listen close, my little dears.
I'll tell you where you got your fears.

61
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:53,874
Of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary.

62
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:59,259
Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary.

63
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,515
Every year we put on a disguise
To save ourselves from her searching eyes.

64
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:14,036
The Nightmare Moon wants just one thing:

65
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:19,140
To gobble up ponies in one quick swing!

66
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:26,859
Hungrily she soars the sky.
If she sees nopony, she passes by.

67
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,395
So if she comes and all is clear,
Equestria is safe another year!

68
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:36,363
Um... Miss Zecora.

69
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:39,469
If we wear costumes to hide
from Nightmare Moon...

70
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,392
...so she won't gobble us up...

71
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:44,696
...how come we still need to
give her some of our candy?

72
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:50,639
A perfect question, my little friend!
For Nightmare Moon you must not offend.

73
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:53,980
Fill up her belly with a treat or two...

74
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,108
So she won't return to come eat YOUUU!

75
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:02,945
Everypony! Just dump some
candy and get outta here!

76
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:28,591
IT'S NIGHTMARE MOON! RUUUN!!!

77
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,092
Princess Luna!

78
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:16,263
CITIZENS OF PONYVILLE!

79
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,310
WE HAVE GRACED YOUR TINY
VILLAGE WITH OUR PRESENCE...

80
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:25,886
...SO THAT YOU MIGHT BEHOLD
THE REAL PRINCESS OF THE NIGHT!

81
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:29,135
A CREATURE OF NIGHTMARE IS
NO LONGER, BUT INSTEAD...

82
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:32,775
...A PONY WHO DESIRES
YOUR LOVE AND ADMIRATION.

83
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:35,639
TOGETHER WE SHALL CHANGE
THIS DREADFUL CELEBRATION...

84
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,712
...INTO A BRIGHT AND
GLORIOUS FEEEAST!

85
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,414
Did you hear that, everypony?

86
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:45,338
Nightmare Moon says
she's gonna feast on us all!

87
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:50,944
What?!

88
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:55,474
No, children, no! You no longer
have reason to fear us.

89
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,304
Screams of delight is
what your princess desires.

90
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:00,406
Not screams of terror.

91
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,781
Madame Mayor.

92
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:07,296
Thy princess of the night hath arrived.

93
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,761
What is the matter with you?

94
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:21,683
Very well then! Be that way!

95
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:25,034
We won't even bother with
the traditional royal farewell.

96
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:27,689
I'm gonna go talk to her.

97
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,634
You can't talk to her!
She's Nightmare Moon!

98
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,888
No, she's not.

99
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,989
I saw the Elements of Harmony
change her back to good.

100
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,142
But it seems like she's having
some trouble adjusting...

101
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,717
...after being gone
for a thousand years.

102
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,957
Princess Luna?

103
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,115
Hi. My name is...

104
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,679
Star Swirl the Bearded.

105
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,678
Commendable costume.
Thou even got the bells right.

106
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,996
Thank you, finally! Somepony
who gets my costume.

107
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:04,277
Uh... I just came to welcome you
to our celebration.

108
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,923
My actual name is...

109
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:07,097
Twilight Sparkle.

110
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,887
IT WAS THOU WHO UNLEASHED
THE POWERS OF HARMONY UPON US...

111
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:13,314
...AND TOOK AWAY OUR DARK POWERS!

112
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,145
And that was a good thing, right?

113
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,790
But of course! We
could not be happier.

114
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,059
Is that not clear?!

115
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,939
Well, you kind of sound
like you're yelling at me.

116
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,981
But this is the traditional
royal Canterlot voice.

117
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,870
It is tradition to speak
using the royal "we"...

118
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:33,618
...and to use THIS MUCH VOLUME
WHEN ADDRESSING OUR SUBJECTS!

119
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:40,825
You know, that might explain why
your appearance was met with...

120
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:42,694
...mixed results.

121
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:45,093
I think if you just changed
your approach a bit...

122
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,789
...you might be met
with a warmer reception.

123
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,201
CHANGE OUR APPROACH?

124
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:52,424
Or the volume.

125
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,940
Oh. We have been locked away
for a thousand years.

126
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:58,847
We are... not sure we can.

127
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:04,666
Don't worry, princess. Fluttershy
can give you some great pointers.

128
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,093
She's delicate and demure
with the sweetest little voice.

129
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,187
GO AWAY! NO CANDY HERE! VISITORS
NOT WELCOME ON NIGHTMARE NIGHT!

130
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,368
Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!

131
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,177
It is you.

132
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,316
Ah, and Nightmare Moon.

133
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:22,081
Nightmare Moon?!

134
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,013
Wait right here.

135
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:35,212
Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?

136
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,919
CHARMED!

137
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,525
Likewise...

138
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:44,902
TWILIGHT SPARKLE HATH SPOKEN
OF THE SWEETNESS OF THY VOICE.

139
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:48,927
WE ASK, THOU TEACHEST TO US
TO SPEAK AS THOU SPEAKEST!

140
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:49,832
Okay...

141
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,441
SHALL OUR LESSONS BEGIN?

142
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,561
Okay...

143
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:54,431
SHALL WE MIMIC THY VOICE?

144
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:55,206
Okay...

145
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:56,699
HOW IS THIS?

146
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,868
Perfect. Lesson over.

147
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,576
A little quieter, princess.

148
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,237
HOW IS... this?

149
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:06,098
Better. Right, Fluttershy?

150
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:08,583
Yes.

151
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,730
How... about... now?

152
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:14,044
Now you're getting it.

153
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,531
And... how about now?

154
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,290
Yes! Well done.

155
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:21,925
AH, THANK YOU, DEAR FLUTTERSHY!

156
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:23,899
OUR NORMAL SPEAKING
VOICE SHALL SURELY...

157
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,812
...WIN US THE HEARTS
OF THY FELLOW VILLAGERS.

158
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,382
Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us!

159
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,743
Nightmare Moon is here and...

160
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:35,195
She stole Fluttershy's voice so she
can't scream when she GOBBLES HER UP!!!

161
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,440
NAY, CHILDREN, WAIT!

162
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:43,959
I mean... nay, children, wait.

163
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:47,854
Come on, princess. Time for plan B.

164
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,713
It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle.

165
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,279
They have never liked us
and they never shall.

166
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,501
My friend Applejack is one of the
most likeable ponies around.

167
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:09,416
I'm sure she'll have some ideas.

168
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:10,929
Heee...!

169
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,959
Whoop. Careful there, partner.

170
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,778
Uh... Applejack.

171
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,561
The princess is looking for a little
advice on how to fit in around here.

172
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:25,538
"Fit in"? Really?

173
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:28,852
I mean... that's easy!

174
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:31,139
All you gotta do is have
the right attitude.

175
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,119
Loosen up a bit, be positive,
play a few games, have some fun.

176
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,821
Fun?

177
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:38,497
What is this "fun" thou speakest of?

178
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,550
Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?

179
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:47,328
Try to land the
sp-sp-spiders on the web.

180
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
You can do it, princess!

181
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:02,642
Ha! Your princess enjoys this... fun.

182
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:05,309
In what other ways
may we experience it?

183
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,470
Fire away, princess!

184
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:16,626
Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!

185
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,283
Why don't you try bobbin' for apples?

186
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:22,908
We got the best apples
in Equestria here, princess.

187
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,764
I ask that thou call us... me...

188
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,304
...Luna, fair Applejack.

189
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:32,706
Hear me, villagers!
All of you! Call me Luna!

190
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,855
Show me to this bobbing apples.

191
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,065
Whoooa...!

192
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,732
Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip?

193
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,405
We lost him the last time
we had to run...

194
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:47,670
NIGHTMARE MOON IS
GOBBLING PIPSQUEAK!

195
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:50,294
EVERYPONY RUUUN!!!

196
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:55,516
Heeelp! My backside has been gobbled!

197
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,030
'Tis a lie!

198
00:13:57,031 --> 00:14:01,495
Thy backside is whole and ungobbled,
thou ungrateful whelp!

199
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,324
Fair villagers, please do not back away.

200
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,343
Let us join together in...

201
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,000
...fun!

202
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,978
Not enough fun for you?
What say you to this?

203
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:37,453
Huzzah! How many points do I receive?

204
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:43,052
Do not run away!

205
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:47,926
As your princess we command you!

206
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:59,743
BE STILL!!!

207
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:07,651
Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!

208
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:09,869
NO, TWILIGHT SPARKLE!

209
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,049
WE MUST USE THE TRADITIONAL
ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE...

210
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,079
...FOR WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO SAY.

211
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,787
SINCE YOU CHOOSE TO FEAR YOUR PRINCESS
RATHER THAN LOVE HER...

212
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:23,042
...AND DISHONOR HER WITH THIS
INSULTING CELEBRATION...

213
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:27,617
...WE DECREE THAT NIGHTMARE
NIGHT SHALL BE CANCELED!

214
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:30,174
FOREVER!

215
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:40,796
Shoot. We had everything goin' our way.

216
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:45,079
Luna was happy, everypony in town
was happy. Now look at 'em.

217
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,455
But I wanted to be a zombie next year!

218
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,656
It's not over yet.

219
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:56,077
What are you gonna do?

220
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,559
I'm going to do what I do best.

221
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:00,134
Lecture her!

222
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,466
Princess.

223
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,588
Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle.

224
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,458
Princess. I'm sorry it hasn't
worked out how we wanted.

225
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,673
But you have to believe me when
I tell you that Nightmare Night...

226
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:22,829
...is one of the most popular
celebrations we have.

227
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,579
Yes. I can tell.

228
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,792
By all the adoring shrieks
of the children as they run away.

229
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,409
Princess.

230
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:55,241
No! No shrieking. No squealing
or screaming either. Okay?

231
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:56,345
Okay.

232
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,703
There's something I want you to see.

233
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:02,336
And I promise that it's safe, but you
really, really, really can't shriek.

234
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,048
Do you promise not to shriek?

235
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,069
Pinkie Pie, you remember
Princess Luna, right?

236
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,593
Ah. The ringleader of the
frightened children.

237
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:22,512
Hast thou come to make peace?

238
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,147
Nightmare Moon!

239
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,749
Rainbow!

240
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:45,017
She's changed, Pinkie!
She's not evil or scary anymore!

241
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:47,644
And she definitely doesn't
want to gobble you up!

242
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,592
Well, duh.

243
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:51,395
Huh?

244
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:53,045
I know that. Sheesh, Twilight.

245
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:56,019
I'm almost as big as her.
How's she gonna gobble me up?

246
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,503
So why do you keep
running away and screaming?

247
00:17:58,504 --> 00:18:01,702
Sometimes it's just
really fun to be scared.

248
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:03,778
Fun?

249
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,404
Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!

250
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:08,857
No, I'm not. I'm a chicken.

251
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,106
Princess Luna!
I've finally figured out...

252
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:14,611
...why you're having
so much trouble being liked!

253
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:17,745
Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.

254
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:20,941
Come with me. I'll explain
everything on the way.

255
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:26,593
Gosh. I never thought my
very first Nightmare Night...

256
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:28,327
...would be my very last.

257
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:34,816
Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret.
Nightmare Night's not over yet.

258
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:40,369
We still have candy left to give,
So Nightmare Moon might let us live.

259
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,308
Yes. Come on, little ponies.

260
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:46,399
What's Nightmare Night without
the annual candy offering?

261
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:50,237
You don't want Nightmare Moon
to gobble you up...

262
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:52,198
...dooo youuu?

263
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:56,007
Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me.

264
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:59,196
Come on, kids!
Doesn't that sound like fun?

265
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:10,098
Goodbye, Nightmare Night.

266
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,887
Forever.

267
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:15,771
CITIZENS OF PONYVILLE!

268
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,007
YOU WERE WISE TO BRING THIS CANDY TO ME.

269
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:21,275
I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR OFFERING.

270
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:23,943
SO PLEASED THAT I MAY JUST EAT IT...

271
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:26,929
...INSTEAD OF EATING YOU!

272
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:38,837
I am not certain that did what
you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle.

273
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,284
Just wait.

274
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,641
For what? For... for them
to scream some more?

275
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,844
Um... Princess Luna.

276
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:49,060
I know there's not gonna be
any more Nightmare Night...

277
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:52,639
...but do you suppose maybe
you could come back next year...

278
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,691
...and scare us again anyway?

279
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:58,767
Child. Are thou saying that thou...

280
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:01,134
...likest me to scare you?

281
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:04,406
It's really fun! Scary, but fun.

282
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:05,784
It... is?

283
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:09,357
Yeah! Nightmare Night is my
favorite night of the year.

284
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:12,429
Well then. We shall have to bring...

285
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,206
...NIGHTMARE NIGHT BACK!

286
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:16,447
Whoa!

287
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:19,542
You're my favorite princess ever!

288
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,674
She said yes, guys!

289
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:23,900
YAY!

290
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,956
See? They really do like you, princess.

291
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:29,057
Can it be true?

292
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,700
OH, MOST WONDERFUL OF...

293
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:35,021
I mean...

294
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,032
Oh, most wonderful of nights.

295
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,417
"Dear Princess Celestia."

296
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:44,218
"When you first sent me to Ponyville,
I didn't know anything about friendship."

297
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:47,295
"I met somepony tonight who
was having the same problem..."

298
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:49,467
"...your sister, Princess Luna."

299
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:52,439
"She taught me that one of the best
things you can do with friendship..."

300
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,860
"...is to give it to others and
help them find it themselves."

301
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:58,852
"And I'm happy to report that
all of Ponyville has learned..."

302
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:03,040
"...that even if somepony seems
a little intimidating, even scary..."

303
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:07,458
"...when you offer them your friendship,
you'll discover a whole new pony underneath."

304
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:11,269
"And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded
costume didn't go over..."

305
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:15,005
"...this still turned out to be
the best Nightmare Night ever."

306
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:36,471
