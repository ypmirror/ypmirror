00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,425
can't we at least try?

177
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,675
Why don't I stay
behind with Coriander

178
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:43,675
to get the restaurant
ready for Zesty's arrival.

179
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:46,500
You and Saffron can try
and drum up some business.

180
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:49,050
One packed restaurant
coming right up.

181
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:53,450
Coriander, I understand
your trepidation.

182
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,250
But I promise you, we will
get those hooves by making

183
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,650
this place feel just like
all of the other restaurants

184
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,225
on Restaurant Row!

185
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:04,125
[sigh] I hope my father
doesn't drive Rarity crazy.

186
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,775
It'll be fine. Rarity's
going to make sure that

187
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:09,025
The Tasty Treat is the
most unique and beautiful

188
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,475
restaurant in Canterlot!

189
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,675
Not like all those stuffy
places on Restaurant Row!

[gasp] The day is almost over

245
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,875
and we haven't found
anyponies! What will we do?

246
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:49,400
Try harder! FILLIES
AND GENTLECOLTS!

247
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,750
Check out the super stupendous
and amazing cuisine

248
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,975
of the Tasty Treat! GRAND
RE-OPENING TONIGHT!

249
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,150
How many Hooves
does it have?

250
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,950
No hooves yet, but
hopefully soon!

251
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,500
Well, when it gets
rated, let us know!

252
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:08,100
Ughh! Stupid hooves!

253
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,775
Oh, look at this, hon!

254
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,325
Oh, The Tasty Treat.

255
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:16,250
Do you think that's
a restaurant, Sugar?

256
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,525
Yes! Yes it IS!

257
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,800
We came to Canterlot
from Winnieapolis

258
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,000
to be adventurous!

259
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,925
But so far the food in all
these hoity- toity places

260
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,750
tastes like somepony cooked up
nuthin' with a side of nuthin!

261
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:31,750
Well, please, come
try The Tasty Treat.

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,975
I think it's going
to be exactly

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,275
what you're
looking for!

264
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,650
[sigh] This is
going to be exactly

265
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,200
what Zesty is looking for!

266
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,025
[door opens]

267
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:48,150
Father, we're ba-- [gasp]

268
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,775
Rarity. What did
you do?

269
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:53,250
Welcome to The Tasty Treat.

270
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,425
You can eat here if you
want. Or not. Who cares?

271
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,525
I know! Isn't it perfect?
Zesty is sure to love it!

272
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,075
I thought we were trying to
make this the most unique

273
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,925
and beautiful
restaurant in Canterlot.

274
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,150
Not make it exactly like
every other restaurant!

275
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,225
[chuckle] We want
to help our friends

276
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,075
by getting them three hooves.
That will only happen

277
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,775
if this IS like every
other restaurant.

278
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,025
Father, what is this?

279
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,850
NOT THAT! ANYTHING BUT THAT!

280
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:27,025
This is what we must cook
if we want to succeed here!

281
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,325
This isn't what I wanted!

282
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,600
I wanted Canterlot
to like US for US!

283
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,700
Rarity, how could you
ruin the restaurant!

284
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:38,975
Ah! [splutters] We've
helped SAVE the restaurant!

285
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,275
Now where are the
other guests?

286
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,150
How many other
ponies are coming?

287
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Two.

288
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,000
Just TWO? I thought you
said you could pack a place

289
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,650
with ponies no matter what!

290
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,625
YOU said you would make
the restaurant better

291
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:55,300
so I guess we both didn't know
what we were talking about!

292
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,250
[knock at door]

293
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,600
[gasp] ZESTY GOURMAND!
Everypony! Places!

294
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,625
Welcome to the Tasty Treat.

295
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,090
What can I get you
this evening?

296
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,150
I hardly think it matters.

297
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:24,775
But by all means, try
your best to impress.

298
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:27,300
Well, we'll both try the
special this evening,

299
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,125
maybe with a little
kick to it, eh?

300
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:31,725
Yeah, we've been craving
some food with actual taste.

301
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,025
Saffron Masala!
What are you doing?

302
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,225
I'm trying to save
our reputations.

303
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,425
I've given it at least
a little bit of flavor.

304
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:47,625
No, no, no, no! But that's
not what Zesty wants!

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,725
What kind of food expert
DOESN'T want flavor?

306
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,425
That's insane!

307
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,325
I'm taking this out there.

308
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:59,275
No! Zesty will hate it!

309
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:02,050
You are going to
RUIN this for them!

310
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,550
No! I'm trying to fix
it after YOU ruined it!

311
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,725
Nooooooooooo!

312
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,600
[splat]

313
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,000
I think we are done here.

314
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,910
Zesty! Please wait.
Allow me to explain.

315
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,775
Rarity. When it comes to
fashion, you are adequate.

316
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,050
But take some advice
from a friend.

317
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,825
Keep your opinions
out of restaurants.

318
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:34,150
Substandard food, laughable
service and I would think

319
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,975
even YOU could recognize
that the decor here

320
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:40,975
is trying desperately
while desperately failing.

321
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,175
Recommending a disreputable
place such as this

322
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,075
could do serious damage
to your social standing.

323
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,400
Disreputable?

324
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:52,500
You mean a place with food
that actually tastes good?

325
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,925
Anypony can throw
ingredients together

326
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,125
and create an obvious taste
that uncultured ponies

327
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,375
like those two can register.

328
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:03,460
Hey!

329
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,425
But it takes a TRUE
culinary artist

330
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,675
to create a subtle taste.

331
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,750
The barest hint
of a sensation.

332
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,900
That's what I bring to
Canterlot. That's art.

333
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:23,140
I'm so embarrassed.

334
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,800
I don't know that there are
words to adequately express

335
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,875
how truly sorry we are.

336
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,600
The worst has happened. No use
crying over spilled food now.

337
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,325
Here, this always cheered
me up when I was younger.

338
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,975
[gasp] My spicy flat
noodle soup! [slurps]

339
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:45,950
Mmm! Oh my, this is
truly delightful.

340
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,900
This is the best thing
you've made so far.

341
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:51,075
And I thought the food
before was the best!

342
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,425
That's all I've ever
wanted to do, Father.

343
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,700
Make food for the
ponies of Canterlot

344
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,950
like the food we made
together when I was younger.

345
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,750
It has been so long since
we've cooked together. [laugh]

346
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,175
Remember how you used
to hide the ingredients

347
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,275
you did not like.

348
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,590
[laugh]

349
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,320
You know what?

350
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,625
Who cares what
some stuffy unicorn

351
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:16,160
thinks of the food
here. It's exquisite.

352
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:17,550
That's true.

353
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:20,350
And you don't need three
silly hooves in your window

354
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:21,300
to prove it.

355
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,240
That's double true!

356
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:26,475
You just need ponies in
here to give it a chance.

357
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,180
Ponies that will tell
everypony else in Canterlot

358
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,850
that the Tasty Treat is
the best food in the city!

359
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,280
THAT'S TRUE TIMES THREE!

360
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,625
But without Zesty's approval,
nopony will even try our food.

361
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,220
Oohoho, yes they will.

362
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,200
Pinkie! We ARE the
perfect team for this;

363
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,150
we were just doing
the wrong jobs.

364
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,000
I will go out and
bring the crowd.

365
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,400
You stay here and make sure
this place is every bit

366
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:54,750
as unique and rustic as it
was the moment we walked in.

367
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,550
And what about us?

368
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,850
You two? You are going to
cook. Make whatever you want.

369
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,075

intend to bring a crowd!

378
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:44,250
Before we open, my father and
I just wanted to say thank you

379
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,325
for all of your help.

380
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,000
We've both been so stressed
about the restaurant

381
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:51,000
succeeding that we forgot
what it was we loved about it

382
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,175
in the first place.

383
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,025

used to love to do together.

reminding us of that.

Welcome to the Tasty Treat!

391
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,760
Please, feel free
to sample the food!

392
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:29,660
Zesty: What's this?

393
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:34,270
What is everypony doing here?
This place has no hooves.

394
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,050
It is not in keeping
with the level of cuisine

395
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,550
that I have set
for Canterlot.

396
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,825
Nopony told you this
place was acceptable.

397
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,650
Uh, Rarity and her friend said
it was good. They told us.

398
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:51,420
They told you? And who are
they to tell you anything?

399
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,025
Rarity can tell you what hats
to wear with which skirts.

400
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,250
Her friend can tell you how
to maintain a tragic look

401
00:19:58,325 --> 00:19:59,575
for a frizzy mane.

402
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,875
They can't tell you
what food you can eat.

403
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,750
No, we can't. And
neither can you.

404
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:08,600
Nopony has the right to tell
these ponies what to think.

405
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,450
Zesty, you have very specific--

406
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:12,800
And very strange!

407
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,425
Yes and very strange
opinions about food.

408
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:16,925
And that's your right.

409
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,450
But just because you like
your food a certain way,

410
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:21,375
there is no reason
to tell these ponies

411
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,550
that they need to
do the same.

412
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,225
Rarity is right!

413
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:26,975
I for one think the
food here is delicious.

414
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:30,050
I own the Smoked Oat
on Restaurant Row!

415
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,000
I hate the food we make!

416
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,700
From now on, it's all
smoked, basted and grilled!

417
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,325
This food is an inspiration!
I own the Bake Shop!

418
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,450
I'm going to bake my
mother's Bundt cake

419
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
the way she made
it! Full of flavor!

420
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:49,880
Yes! Yeah!

421
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,780
Zesty, are you sure you
wouldn't like to try the food?

422
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,625
Ignoring a unique and fresh
establishment such as this

423
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,700
could do serious damage
to your social standing.
