1
00:00:02,829 --> 00:00:05,789
The magical properties of this
spell will only have lasting

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,045
effects if you focus on--

3
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:10,064
No! Rainbow Dash!

4
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:13,449
How in Equestria does
that pony expect to pass

5
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:15,125
her History of the
Wonderbolts exam tomorrow

6
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,702
if she's wasting time flying?

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,537
I'm just gonna fly
right up to her

8
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:20,366
and tell her what I think

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,476
about her lackadaisical
approach to studying.

10
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:24,095
Won't she be surprised.

11
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:24,735
Surprise!

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,618
What? Huh?
How did you?

13
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,146
Please, Twilight.

14
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,230
That was the worst
sneak attack ever.

15
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:32,565
What? But--

16
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,967
I saw you giving me the
stink eye from the ground.

17
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,095
And heard you flying towards me
and muttering from a mile away.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,507
Well, if you heard me
muttering then you must know

19
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:41,705
what I was muttering about.

20
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:44,405
Yeah, yeah, the
Wonderbolts History test.

21
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:45,730
No big deal.

22
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,868
No. Big Deal.

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,009
Really Big
Deal.

24
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:50,883
It's a test!

25
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,612
A test that will
determine if you can join

26
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,468
the newly formed
Wonderbolts Reserves.

27
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,275
And being part of the
Wonderbolts Reserves

28
00:00:56,282 --> 00:00:57,309
means you'll have
the opportunity

29
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:58,864
to live your dream
as a Wonderbolt.

30
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,490
This is the most important
test of your life!

31
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:04,440
Twilight, not everypony
gets all freaked out

32
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,748
about tests like you.

33
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:08,956
I do not get all
freaked out about tests.

34
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:10,762
Uh, seriously?

35
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:14,546
Your freak-outs are so epic you
sing whole "freak-out" arias

36
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:15,440
about freaking out.

37
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,652
Fine. I may tend to take my
tests a little seriously.

38
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:22,790
But that doesn't mean you
shouldn't be studying for yours.

39
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,235
Oooh! And I know just the
pony who can help you!

40
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:29,812
Me!

41
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,023
This is going to
so much fun!

42
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:37,531
Sure. Fun.

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,400
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu</i>

44
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:19,525
Agh! Wha?

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,236
Hunh?

46
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,232
This is the most complete--

47
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:23,916
And ginormous!

48

<i>book on the History</i>
<i>of the Wonderbolts.</i>

49
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:29,662
OK, but how am I supposed
to get what's in there...

50
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,086
Into here?

51
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,749
With my handy dandy Study
Checklist, of course.

52
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:36,370
Of course.

53
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,395
First up: Reading
and Highlighting.

54
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:42,692
Reading and highlighting
is the foundation

55
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,138
of any good study method.

56
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:46,716
It allows the student to
hone in and boil down

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,982
what's really important,

58
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:49,990
separating the
good from the bad,

59
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,909
<i>the wheat from the chaff,</i>
<i>getting to the crux of things.</i>

60
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,059
Let's see what
you've got so far.

61
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:56,349
Um...

62
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:57,426
Huh?

63
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,540
By highlighting everything,
you don't really

64
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:03,422
separate the wheat
from the chaff.

65
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,774
Or the good from the bad.

66
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:10,113
Hey. I am not that tall!

67
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,240
OK, Rainbow.

68
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,182
Clearly reading and highlighting
is not your style of studying.

69
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,660
<i>So let's move on to</i>
<i>the tried and true.</i>

70
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:23,631
History Lecture!

71
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:27,537
Yes, Rainbow?

72
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:29,910
Is it snack time?

73
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:30,850
No.

74
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,419
Recess?

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,036
No.

76
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:36,702
Can't we just watch the History
of the Wonderbolts movie?

77
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,080
No!

78
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,930
Now just get comfortable
and experience...

79
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,886
the magic of learning.

80
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:46,095
Ahem!

81
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,520
Prior to the great
Celestia/Luna Rift,

82
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,754
there was no need for the
Earth, Unicorn, Pegasi,

83
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,672
or E.U.P.--Guard.

84
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,460
<i>But after Luna's banishment,</i>

85
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:58,899
<i>the Protective Pony</i>
<i>Platoons</i> were formed.

86
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:02,444
<i>On the anniversary of the</i>
<i>first Celestial Year of Peace,</i>

87
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,308
a celebration was held.

88
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:08,376
Headed by General Firefly...

89
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,965
<i>An elite team of aerial</i>
<i>performers were chosen</i>

90
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,309
<i>to help commemorate this</i>
<i>auspicious occasion.</i>

91
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:16,251
The first performance
was so full of energy,

92
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,845
so highly charged, that magical
lightning showered down

93
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:20,606
on the crowd.

94
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:23,381
<i>Everypony was so filled</i>
<i>with amazement and wonder</i>

95
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:27,239
that General Firefly dubbed
them the Wonderbolts.

96
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,829
Rainbow Dash!

97
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:35,069
Can you repeat
any of my lesson?

98
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:57,139
History lecture?

99
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,264
Nope.

100
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,240
OK, Rainbow...Rainbow?

101
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:03,797
Rainbow Dash!

102
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:05,235
Here.

103
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:11,334
Let's move on to my favorite
style of learning: Flashcards.

104
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:16,647
Ooh! Does that mean
I'll learn in a flash?

105
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:18,788
One can only hope.

106
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:23,654
Colonel Purple Dart, the leader
of the Wonderbolts in the

107
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:25,473
4th Celestial Era was
known for his...

108
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:26,762
Wha?

109
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:29,438
Rainbow, did you
see what happened?

110
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,267
What? No! I was riveted by
your captivating cards.

111
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,005
Hmmmm.

112
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,008
After becoming the
official flying squadron

113
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,465
for Princess Celestia, she
honored them with...

114
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:42,813
Gotcha!

115
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:43,982
Got what?

116
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,047
The original Wonderbolts
lightning bolt insignia was...

117
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,080
Ah!

118
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,160
Rainbow Dash.

119
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,332
You could have hurt me.

120
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:56,282
With a spit wad? Really?

121
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,127
A spit wad to the eye would
have been no laughing matter.

122
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:03,209
Well, if you can horse
around like this,

123
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,469
then you clearly must
be ready for the test.

124
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:06,675
Clearly!

125
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:09,756
Well then, I guess you're
also ready for a...

126
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,667
pop quiz.

127
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:13,691
Bring it!

128
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:18,503
The initials E.U.P.
stand for what?

129
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,665
Ernie's Undercooked Pancakes.

130
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:23,149
The original aerial
team performed for...

131
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,121
Celestia's Cereal
Celebration.

132
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:29,096
The Wonderbolts were given their
name by this famous Pegasus.

133
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:30,279
Who is she?

134
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,169
Please don't say Colonel Waffle.

135
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,929
Hello? General
Blazing Donut Glaze.

136
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,550
So, did I ace it or what?

137
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:42,120
Or what.

138
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,534
You didn't get one
answer correct.

139
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,362
What? But how?

140
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,471
I don't know.

141
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:49,116
I've never heard
answers so wrong.

142
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,127
And so breakfast related.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,205
If you had taken the
official test today...

144
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,120
My dreams of being
in the Wonderbolts Reserves

145
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:00,025
would've been totally crushed.

146
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:02,282
What am I gonna do?

147
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,789
I'm running out of time!

148
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,385
I don't know any
of this history!

149
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:08,487
I'm going to fail!

150
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:15,912
I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna
fail, I'm gonna fail.

151
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,140
And it's all your fault!

152
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,186
My fault?

153
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm the one helping you.

154
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:23,082
Maybe your famous
"study methods"

155
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,450
aren't all they're
cracked up to be!

156
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:25,730
Eh, teacher?

157
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:29,931
Excuse me, I've used them
to study for many a test

158
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,094
and passed.

159
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:32,801
Yeah, right.

160
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,773
Do you know the name of the
premiere Wonderbolts choreographer?

161
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:37,535
Uh, well...

162
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:39,566
Commander Easy Glider.

163
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,575
Do you know how many Pegasi
flew in the original squad?

164
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:43,615
Um...

165
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:44,452
Seven!

166
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:47,715
Do you know Princess Celestia's
favorite flight pattern?

167
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,569
The Icaranian Sun Salutation.

168
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:53,143
See? I could
pass the test.

169
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:54,158
Fine.

170
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:55,555
Rub it in, why
don't you?

171
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:59,293
Besides, I don't see why I have
to take this lousy test anyway.

172
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,080
I've proven I'm one of
the best fliers around.

173
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:05,071
Knowing their origin and being
able to properly represent them

174
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,765
for all of Equestria
is just as important.

175
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:08,989
Yeah, right.

176
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,471
<i>Some history buff like you</i>
<i>must've made that up</i>

177
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:13,065
to bring us fliers down.

178
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:16,130
Knowing history actually
is beneficial, Rainbow.

179
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:19,141
Beneficial for eggheads.

180
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,912
Girls.

181
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,954
Well, this egghead knows
history and can fly.

182
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,057
Maybe I should
become a Wonderbolt.

183
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,701
Just 'cause you've got wings
doesn't mean you can fly.

184
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:28,489
Girls!

185
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,759
You're barely able to
just get off the ground.

186
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,249
Girls! Stop!

187
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,823
Now, is that any way
to talk to a friend?

188
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:42,005
Sorry.

189
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,226
Yeah, sorry.

190
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:46,641
Don't you have more
important things to do?

191
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:49,139
Like prepare Rainbow
for her big test?

192
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,223
I've tried everything,
Fluttershy,

193
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:53,508
but none of my study
methods work for her.

194
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,704
Well, no offense to your
teaching methods, Twilight,

195
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,926
but I think I may have
a way to help Rainbow.

196
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:04,497
Oh! Who's that?
Who's that?

197
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:07,734
Celestia and Luna, back
when they were happy.

198
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:30,199
Now what?

199
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:35,106
Gummy's an Earth Pony; Winona's
a Unicorn and Tank is a Pegasus.

200
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:36,476
They're the E.U.P.

201
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:38,183
helping to protect
the Princess.

202
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:43,531
How are you
getting all this?

203
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,137
Oh no!

204
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,222
Stop, stop, stop!

205
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:01,157
That was aw--

206
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,048
Awesome!

207
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:04,977
I give it three "Woo hoos"
Woo hoo, Woo hoo, Woo hoo!

208
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:06,690
And an extra "Woo"
for good measure.

209
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:07,601
Woo!

210
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,142
Well, I give it a
"Whoa, whoa, what?"

211
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:14,312
I'm totally confused and
I just want to go home.

212
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:15,765
Whoa! Hey!

213
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,680
Whoa, your woes,
there Woeful.

214
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,869
Someponies learn through
theatrical presentation.

215
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:23,045
But other ponies learn
through musical intervention.

00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:21,734
What? No. Really?

238
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,828
But I've got to
learn this stuff.

239
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:24,880
Now!

240
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,378
And I am just the
pony to help.

241
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,859
Rarity. You look ridiculous.

242
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:35,043
I'm going to ignore that comment
out of my desire to help you.

243
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:37,441
Good luck.

244
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:42,731
Get ready, Rainbow Dash,
for I am going to take you

245
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:46,228
on an historical
adventure in fashion.

246
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,155
I am now modeling the rather
unattractive, and frankly,

247
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:54,058
itchy original Wonderbolts'
flying costume.

248
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:57,935
Fortunately, thanks to the
vision of Flair de Mare,

249
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:00,899
the Wonderbolts ensemble
became more streamlined

250
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:02,831
in a wonderfully
breathable fabric.

251
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:07,137
Of course, there were
fashion hits and misses.

252
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:11,121
<i>Just look at those</i>
<i>dreadful bell bottoms.</i>

253
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,036
<i>What were ponies thinking?</i>

254
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,974
I don't know.

255
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:16,554
I bet General Flash
rocked these things.

256
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,522
Ah! Pinkie! You're real!

257
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:19,514
Of course I'm real.

258
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,523
I mean, I'm not the
real General Flash,

259
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:22,963
the 10th leader of
the Wonderbolts.

260
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:24,919
But I, Pinkie, am really real.

261
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:28,753
And I'm Admiral Fairy Flight,
from the 7th squadron.

262
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,474
And of course, you recognize
Commander Easy Glider.

263
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,636
And I'm sportin' some
sort of get-up worn

264
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,277
by Colonel Purple Dart.

265
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,244
Just look at us.

266
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,671
Look at us.

267
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,017
Look at me!

268
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:43,943
It's too much for my eyes!

269
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,081
Now, don't you fret, Rainbow.

270
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:47,646
This fashion show nonsense

271
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,334
wouldn't help me
learn nothin' either.

272
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,732
Really?

273
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,796
Well, what special study
trick do you have, AJ?

274
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:55,799
Who me?

275
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,385
Oh, I got nothin'.

276
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:58,396
Aw.

277
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,182
Why, I could tell you every
little thing there is to know

278
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,585
about the history of Apples.

279
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:05,112
But I picked all that up
over years in the field

280
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:06,374
as a labor of love.

281
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:08,056
How much time you got?

282
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,479
Twelve hours.

283
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:11,892
Oh, then you are up a creek.

284
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:18,124
Well, I think we should just go
back to old-fashioned studying.

285
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,847
What about our play?

286
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:23,791
Just look at these costumes.

287
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:26,940
Surely something resonates
with your inner Wonderbolt.

288
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:29,240
And Granny Smith discovered
the first Granny Smith

289
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:31,498
in Phillydelphia when
she was just a filly.

And no apples!

301
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:57,925
I am never going
to pass this test.

302

Ever!

303
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:00,640
Just forget it.

304
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:17,393
Rainbow, I'm sorry
about all that.

305
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:19,383
We didn't mean to
overwhelm you.

306
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:22,226
It's OK. You were
just trying to help.

307
00:14:22,517 --> 00:14:25,322
It's just too bad I'm too
dumb to learn anything.

308
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,348
You are not dumb.

309
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,059
You just learn differently.

310
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,970
If by "differently"
you mean "not at all"

311
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,541
then you're totally right.

312
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,115
No, that's totally wrong.

313
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:37,996
See? Wrong again.

314
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:43,463
I don't know anypony that's read
more Daring Do books than you.

315
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,160
Well, that's not gonna get
me into the Wonderbolts.

316
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,296
And your knowledge of
jokes and pranks

317
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:49,705
is only rivaled by Pinkie.

318
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,094
<i>Great, my years of being</i>
<i>a class clown</i>

319
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,105

<i>learning how to learn.</i>

320
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,124
That's not what I meant.

321
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,899
You're smart, creative,
inventive, and...Ugh!

322
00:15:02,513 --> 00:15:04,905
Hey! I know you're upset,
but you don't need to--

323
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:09,693
Whoa!

324
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:11,808
I almost slammed into that.

325
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,745
<i>I know!</i>

326
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:15,254
You were jabbering on so
much, you didn't even notice.

327
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:16,848
But how did you notice?

328
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,588
You were listening and
talking to me the whole time.

329
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:21,699
Ha ha! You're such a rookie.

330
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:24,659
An experienced flyer like
me knows how to multi-task.

331
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:26,347
While you fly?

332
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:27,428
It's essential.

333
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,416
Yes, I was paying
attention to you,

334
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,524
but was also scanning the sky
and the ground for any problems.

335
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:33,744
Really?

336
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,884
Flying's not just flying.

337
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,105
<i>In order to stay</i>
<i>safe in the sky,</i>

338
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,013
<i>I've got to hear and</i>
<i>see everything</i>

339
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,352
<i>down to the littlest detail.</i>

340
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:44,827
For instance, I saw Apple Bloom,
<i>Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo</i>

341
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,126
<i>come out of Sugar Cube Corner.</i>

342
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:47,385
<i>And from the looks of it,</i>

343
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,555
<i>they had carrot cupcakes</i>
<i>with sprinkles.</i>

344
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:53,408
<i>And I'm thinking Big Mac</i>
<i>sold a huge order of apples</i>

345
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:57,529
<i>to Filthy Rich because I heard</i>
<i>him give a very hearty, "Eeyup."</i>

346
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,529
I always make note of
everything when I fly.

347
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:02,620
No biggie.

348
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,020
Oh my gosh!

349
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:05,666
What?

350
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:06,677
Gotta go!

351
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:09,320
Yeah, I get it.

352
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:12,686
I wouldn't want to hang out
with a loser like me either.

353
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:24,388
Thanks for meeting
me, everypony.

354
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:25,594
What is it, Twilight?

355
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,371
We have to help Rainbow Dash.

356
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,321
<i>Yes, but how?</i>

357
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,745
We've tried every
kind of studying.

358
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,768
My way, your way.

359
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,104
But we haven't tried
Rainbow Dash's way.

360
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:39,650
Hm, I'm intrigued.

361
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:43,730
OK, listen up, ponies;
here's the plan.

362
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:50,595
Hey, Rainbow.

363
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:52,124
Wanna go for a fly?

364
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:54,489
Sure.

365
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:55,902
Got nothin' better to do.

366
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:01,012
Didn't we just do this?

367
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:03,832
Yes but, like you said,
I'm such a newbie,

368
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,455
I need all the
practice I can get.

369
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,901
Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll
become a great flier in no time.

370
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:13,414
After all, you're
good at everything.

371
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:19,888
So what's going on?

372
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:21,092
Oh, nothing.

373
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:23,090
Just getting my
dreams crushed.

374
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,160
Uh,read any good books lately?

375
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:28,749
Just history books.

376
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:30,532
I'd tell you what
they're about,

377
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,805
but my brain is
as dry as a rock.

378
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:37,676
Speaking of rocks, did
you know Pinkie Pie

379
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,170
grew up on a rock farm?

380
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:42,602
Maybe I'll go work there,
since I have no other plans

381
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,228
for the rest of my life.

382
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,921
Oh, come on now, Rainbow.

383
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:47,736
You can't give up on your dream.

384
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,618
Seems my dream has
given up on me.

385
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,770
Maybe I'll learn
to shine shoes.

386
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:53,886
Sell hats.

387
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:54,961
Dig ditches.

388
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,490
Or maybe you'll be
a Wonderbolt.

389
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:01,070
Twilight, give it
up! I have.

390
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,959
So! What do you remember
about that flight?

391
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:12,288
Nothing important.

392
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,777
Except, after Luna was
banished to the moon,

393
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:17,640
Celestia needed
protective forces,

394
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:20,920
so Earth, Unicorn, and Pegasi
formed the E.U.P. Guard

395
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:23,133
of the Protective
Pony Platoons.

396
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:25,334
Yes?

397
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:29,689
And at the celebration of the
first Celestial Year of Peace,

398
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:31,736
an elite flying
squadron performed

399
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:34,796
headed by General Firefly
who later named the group

400
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:36,126
the Wonderbolts!

401
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:36,915
Uh huh?

402
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,808
Commander Easy Glider
established flight choreography

403
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:42,078
that is still used by
the Wonderbolts today.

404
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,506
Yes!

405
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,920
I know the history.

406
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,326
I know it all.

407
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,253
But how in Equestria
did that happen?

408
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,949
You learned it.

409
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:54,645
Yeah, I got that, but how?

410
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,023
Well, on our first flight, I
discovered that you catalogue

411
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:00,163
everything that happens all
around you when you're flying

412
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,839
without even thinking about it.

413
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:04,872
Don't you see?

414
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:07,633
I made use of your special
skills by enlisting everypony

415
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,871
to help you learn the
History of the Wonderbolts.

416
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:16,392
I, Princess Celestia, banish
you, Princess Luna to the moon.

417
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,934
No!

418
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:24,007
Earth!

419
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,630
Unicorn!

420
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:27,116
Pegasus!

421
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:28,169
E!

422
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:29,496
U!

423
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:30,558
P!

424
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:31,920
Eeyup.

425
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:36,074
Let us celebrate our first
Celestial Year of Peace.

426
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,747
Yeah. Let's party.
I'm General Firefly.

427
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,207
Gee, my costume is
itchy and unattractive.

428
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:43,695
But I'm gonna assemble
an awesome flying team.

429
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,862
I'll call them the Wonderbolts.

430
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:51,201
Streamlined style
by Flaire de Mare.

431
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:52,911
Admiral Fair Weather.

432
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:55,441
Colonel Purple Dart.

433
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:58,144
Admiral Fairy Flight.

434
00:19:58,649 --> 00:19:59,670
General Flash.

435
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,296
Commander Easy Glider.

436
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,106
The History of the Wonderbolts.

437
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:22,337
Oh my gosh, oh my
gosh, oh my gosh!

438
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:23,555
Thank you!

439
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,797
Thank you all so much!

440
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:26,893
You're welcome.

441
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,333
But it all came from you.

442
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,462
You learn without
knowing you're learning.

443
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,795
<i>Your main focus is flying,</i>
<i>but then your brain</i>

444
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,189
<i>is also absorbing lots of</i>
<i>other information.</i>

445
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:38,474
It's actually
really brilliant.

446
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,851
Ha! I always knew
I was brilliant.

447
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,189
<i>Rainbow Dash finally learned</i>
<i>the History of the Wonderbolts.</i>

448
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,848
<i>But she's not the only</i>
<i>pony that needed a lesson.</i>

449
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:53,763
<i>I needed to learn something</i>
<i>just as important.</i>

450
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:56,495
<i>One way of learning isn't</i>
<i>better than another.</i>

451
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,599
<i>After all, everypony is</i>
<i>unique and individual.</i>

452
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,183
Ha ha! Whoo!
