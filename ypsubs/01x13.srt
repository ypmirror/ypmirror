1
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:08,601
Hoowee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who
works with her head in the clouds.

2
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:11,457
Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?

3
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,130
I know I can.

4
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:18,016
Oh, for Pete's sake!

5
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:22,407
Heh! Looks like this pegasus can
pitch better than the workhorse.

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:26,282
The object of the game is to
get the closest to the stake.

7
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:30,214
Alright, alright.
You got another throw there, pony girl.

8
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:36,360
Wow, Rainbow! Heh. You couldn't hit the
barn door with that kind of a throw.

9
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:41,850
Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest
throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.

10
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,070
Yeehaw! It's a ringer.

11
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,409
That's how you do it down here on the farm.

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,805
I lost.

13
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:57,158
Oh, don't feel bad, Rainbow.
It's all in good fun.

14
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,237
I hate losing.

15
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,206
Besides, you're a mighty good athlete.
I'm just better, heh heh heh...

16
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:07,397
Alright, Applejack! You think you're
the top athlete in all of Ponyville?

17
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:11,857
Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria,
but that might be gilding the lily.

18
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:15,444
And I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it!

19
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:16,498
Prove what?

20
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:20,315
I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition.

21
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,892
A series of athletic contests to decide
who's the best once and for all!

22
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,419
You know what, Rainbow? You're on!

23
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,029
So you two are doing what now?

24
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,346
-An Iron...
-Iron Pony competition.

25
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:22,109
See, we've set up a bunch of events
to decide which one of us is...

26
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,514
The most athletic pony ever!

27
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:26,953
And I'm here to...

28
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:31,477
Uh... I don' know! Why is she here?

29
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:33,375
To be our judge and keep score.

30
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:38,710
Right, heh! Somepony's gotta record
my awesomeness for the history books.

31
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,901
Hello everypony and welcome to
the first annual Iron Pony competition!

32
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:49,847
Uh... Spike? Who are you talking to?

33
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,108
Um... Them!

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,940
Let the games begin!

35
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:03,235
Ready, set, go!

36
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:10,707
Dagnabit!

37
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:12,327
Time, Spike?

38
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:13,759
17 seconds.

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,052
You're kiddin'. That breaks my
record from last year's rodeo.

40
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:20,957
But you got a five second
penalty for nudging the barrel.

41
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,813
Nuts n' screws!

42
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,983
Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby.

43
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:30,818
Hey, don't be nervous.
Remember, it's all in good fun.

44
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,887
Now git on up there!

45
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,425
Ready, set, go!

46
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:44,317
Whoo! That was some fancy
hoofwork there, Rainbow!

47
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,894
Thanks! But I couldn't have been as fast as you.

48
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:49,517
What was the time on that, Spike?

49
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:51,507
18 seconds!

50
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:53,728
18 seconds?!

51
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,034
Rainbow, are you sure you're
not secretly a rodeo pony?

52
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:59,757
Rainbow Dash wins the Barrel Weave!

53
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:03,504
I can't believe I won!

54
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:06,392
Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it!

55
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:18,571
Mighty respectable, but let me
show you how it's really done.

56
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,953
Years of applebuckin'.

57
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:32,146
Why me?

58
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,591
Go!

59
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,957
Ready for another pony ride?

60
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:45,857
No...

61
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:46,978
Go!

62
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:53,035
Rainbow Dash wins the Bronco Buck!

63
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:55,926
And I lose...

64
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:09,463
How I get roped into these things...

65
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,438
Does this count?

66
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:54,210
Fillies and gentlecolts!

67
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,708
At the halfway point our
competitors are tied at 5 and 5!

68
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,529
Who are you talking to?

69
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:02,693
Them!

70
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,638
95...

71
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,367
96...

72
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,399
97...

73
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:13,458
98...

74
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,368
99...

75
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,076
-A hundred!
-Yes!

76
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,361
Be a good sport, Applejack.

77
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:59,861
All right, you two. This is the final event.
Give it all you've got!

78
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:08,225
Looks like the workhorse might
come out ahead in this one.

79
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:15,961
[That's not fair! You can't use
your wings to help you win!]

80
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:18,124
[You're cheatin'!]

81
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,524
[I can't understand you with
that rope in your mouth.]

82
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,767
I SAID...! Uh-oh.

83
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:29,406
I win by a landslide!

84
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:32,539
Or mudslide in your case.

85
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:36,980
I am the Iron Pony!

86
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,773
Only 'cos you cheated!

87
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:39,894
What?

88
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:44,370
You used your wingpower to help
you win over half those contests!

89
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,493
Sounds like sour apples to me.

90
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:49,285
Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?

91
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:53,044
Well... no. But you never said
I couldn't use my wings.

92
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:56,261
I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.

93
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,814
I still would have won even without my wings.

94
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,383
Hah! Prove it.

95
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:02,479
Gladly. How?

96
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,020
Tomorrow's the annual Runnin' of the Leaves.
I challenge you to race me in it!

97
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:09,881
Heh! Easy shmeasy.

98
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:11,024
Hold on!

99
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:17,306
There is one condition: the point is to *run*.
So no wings allowed!

100
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:18,707
No wings?

101
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:20,695
No problem!

102
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:37,220
Twilight, hurry up!
We're gonna be late for the race.

103
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,612
Why are you so excited about the race?
It's only for ponies.

104
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:43,070
Yeah, but I'm hoping I can
be the announcer again.

105
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:45,830
Just listen: Fillies and gentlecolts...

106
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:48,650
Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves!

107
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:53,429
This is Pinkie Pie, your official
eye-in-the-sky announcer.

108
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,004
Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken.

109
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:02,390
As everypony knows, the Running
is very important tradition...

110
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:06,027
...for without it, the autumn leaves
of Equestria would never fall.

111
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:10,873
So get ready, ponies. The Running of
the Leaves will begin in 5 minutes.

112
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,052
Pardon me! Excuse me!

113
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:21,413
Make way for the Iron Pony!

114
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:23,265
The Iron Phony, you mean.

115
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:27,389
So, Applejack. You ready to win second place?

116
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,926
I'm ready to run a good, clean race!

117
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,243
Yeah, yeah...

118
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:33,943
You are not allowed to use your wings!

119
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:37,614
I could win this race with both
wings tied behind my back.

120
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:45,829
Trussed up like a turkey.
Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.

121
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,231
Very funny.

122
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:50,203
'least now we know we're racin' fair and square.

123
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:53,249
Racers! Please take your position.

124
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,269
Um... Pinkie Pie?

125
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,900
Hey, Spike! What's up?

126
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,979
Oh wait, it me! I'm up!

127
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:03,554
Uh, yeah, uh... I know you're doing
the announcing today and stuff and...

128
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:07,047
I'm sure you're gonna do a great job
and all, but... I was just wondering...

129
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:07,920
What?

130
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,743
Uh... Forget it!

131
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,048
Spike!

132
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:16,079
Would you like to be my co-reporter?
We could comment on the action together!

133
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,168
We could?

134
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:19,542
Climb on up!

135
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,492
Twilight? What in tarnation
are you doin' up here?

136
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:27,739
I'm racing!

137
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:31,982
Good one, Twilight!

138
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,727
I'm not joking.

139
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:34,692
What?!

140
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:39,012
You're not an athlete, you're a...
well... you're an egghead.

141
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,575
I am not an egghead! I am well read.

142
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:42,976
Egghead.

143
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,390
But ha... have you ever run a race?

144
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:51,113
Well, no. But I do know a lot about running.

145
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:52,822
And you know this from...

146
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:55,462
Books. I've read several on the subject.

147
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:01,607
What'd you read?
The "Egghead's Guide to Running"?

148
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:06,134
Di... di... did you stretch out
your eye muscles to warm up?

149
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:08,116
HA HA HA HA!

150
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,784
Get it? Eye muscles!

151
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:15,366
Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running
of the leaves is a Ponyville tradition.

152
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:19,585
And since I'm here to learn, I've
decided I should experience it myself.

153
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:22,856
Well, I think that's just
dandy, Twilight. Good luck!

154
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,746
Yeah! See you at the finish line!

155
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:28,147
Tomorrow.

156
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:33,886
All right, ponies! Are you ready?

157
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:35,287
Get set!

158
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,259
And they're off!

159
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,002
Welcome to the official coverage
of the Running of the Leaves.

160
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:46,701
You know, Spike, despite its name, the
leaves don't do any of the actual running.

161
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:49,203
No, that's left to My Little Ponies.

162
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:53,640
Why... Yes, Pinkie. It's the running of the
ponies that causes the leaves to fall.

163
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:57,396
Ugh... Those lazy, lazy leaves.

164
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:01,998
But his year, the run is
about more than the weather.

165
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:05,325
It's about the race to the finish
and the two runners want to win it.

166
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,464
Applejack and Rainbow Dash.

167
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:11,333
You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit
of a grudge match they're trying to settle.

168
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,820
Trying to prove who's the most athletic.

169
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:16,831
Yes and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".

170
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:19,437
Yes, it... does. What?

171
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,644
And I like fudge. But if I eat too much
fudge, I get a pudge and then I can't budge.

172
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,131
So... no fudge?

173
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,845
Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast.

174
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:31,276
Let's check in with our two competitive
ponies: Applejack and Rainbow Dash.

175
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,370
Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack
and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched...

176
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:35,647
...running neck and neck.

177
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:39,794
But what's this? Applejack is making
the move, she's now ahead by a nose.

178
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:44,124
But Rainbow Dash pulls Applejack up and
takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose.

179
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:48,237
Or maybe three quarters of a nose.
No, about 63.7% of a nose...

180
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,469
Roughly speaking.

181
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:54,118
Applejack sees this move and pushes
forth with her strong workhorse legs...

182
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,760
...slinking ahead by 350 noses!

183
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,140
Not so easy without wings, is it?

184
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:03,146
Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash!

185
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:09,951
Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash
is catching up the frontrunner Applejack.

186
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:13,714
What an upset! I thought
Applejack had this in the bag.

187
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,250
You didn't think I was gonna let
you off that easy, did you?

188
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:26,858
I don't believe it!

189
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,226
I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?

190
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:33,071
Not the scenery, Twilight.
Rainbow Dash just tripped me.

191
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,227
She did not.

192
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:35,258
She did too!

193
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:36,402
She did not!

194
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:39,419
And if you slowed down and looked
where you're going, like me...

195
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,595
...you'd see that you tripped over a rock.

196
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:44,275
What? Oh, hayseed!

197
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,154
Now I got a lot of ground to
make up to catch Rainbow.

198
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:49,881
Just be careful!

199
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,202
See you at the finish line!

200
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,347
I don't believe it!

201
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:07,019
After a huge setback, Applejack is
back at the front of the pack.

202
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,528
She's the head of the pack, all right.
The pick of the litter! The CAT'S PYJAMAS!

203
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:16,838
Oh, wait! Why would Applejack take some poor
kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.

204
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:20,222
Oookay... Let's get back to the race.

205
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:24,725
Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet.

206
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:26,157
It is for you.

207
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:39,943
I don't believe it! Applejack tripped me.

208
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:41,884
Don't you ponies ever look where you're going?

209
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:44,211
You tripped on a stump. See?

210
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:47,281
Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.

211
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:50,889
Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat.
It was just an accident.

212
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,335
Sure it was.

213
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:56,271
I mean... Yeah! I'm sure it was.

214
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:58,880
Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.

215
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:02,131
Yes. But the rules have changed.

216
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,630
And two can play at that game.

217
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:11,231
Welcome back, Ponyvillians! It's me, Pinkie Pie.

218
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:12,344
And Spike.

219
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,322
Looks like Rainbow's doing her best to catch up.

220
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:17,955
I'm not sure how ketchup is
going to help her in this contest.

221
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:21,458
Now, in a hot dog eating contest it
can make them doggies nice and slippery.

222
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,819
But personally, I prefer mustard.
How about you, Spike?

223
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:26,858
Uh... I like... pickles?

224
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:32,206
Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself
in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.

225
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:35,357
Look, ma! No wings!

226
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:40,660
As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail
Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.

227
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:49,616
Hey! Rainbow!

228
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:54,540
Why, that little cheater did that on purpose!

229
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:57,112
It's on!

230
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:00,720
Nice one, Rainbow.

231
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:01,523
...Later!...

232
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:48,784
Oh my! Whitetail Wood is just lovely.

233
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,744
Hey, Rainbow! Shouldn't you be up ahead?

234
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,625
I'm sure I'll win now.

235
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:58,426
Except that all the other racers just passed you.

236
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,776
Oh horse apples...! See ya!

237
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,860
Applejack! What are you doing up here?

238
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,419
There aren't even any trees.

239
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,093
Uh, no, but the sign's pointed this way...

240
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:13,187
Rainbow!

241
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,584
Mind giving me a lift?

242
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,496
What a hay?! You said no flying!

243
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:23,683
No. I said no wings.

244
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,668
I must say, Spike, that this has been...

245
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:30,200
...the most interesting Running
of the Leaves in Equestria history!

246
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,679
With the most interesting announcing...

247
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:39,038
But it isn't the running that's been fascinating.

248
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,720
It's the lack of running!

249
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:25,869
Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete...

250
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,218
...but shouldn't the Running of
the Leaves actually involve running?

251
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:32,077
You know, I think Twilight's right.

252
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:33,312
You do?

253
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,521
Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better...

254
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:38,186
RUUUN!

255
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:44,564
Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are
neck and neck, jockeying for position.

256
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:47,115
Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow...

257
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:50,283
...it's Applejack, it's
Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack!

258
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,089
Oh no, she di'int!

259
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,024
Oh yes, she di'id!

260
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:02,328
Cut it out!

261
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:03,702
No, you cut it out!

262
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:05,294
You started it!

263
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,270
And now I'm gonna finish it.

264
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,360
Oh no, you won't!

265
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,371
Oh yes, I will!

266
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:23,167
That's it! All bets are off.

267
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:26,186
Oh no, you don't!

268
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:35,911
It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash,
it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash!

269
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,270
I won!

270
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,579
No! I won!

271
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,501
I won!

272
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:45,902
You tied!

273
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,300
Tied?!

274
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:48,288
For first?

275
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:49,713
For last!

276
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:50,949
LAST?!

277
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,568
Then who won?

278
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:55,451
YOU?!

279
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,973
Oh, no. But I did get fifth place.

280
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:01,745
Which is rather good, considering
I've never run a race before.

281
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:04,175
What?! How's that even possible?

282
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:07,848
You ran so slow. And looked at the scenery.

283
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:11,433
Exactly! I paced myself, just like my book said.

284
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:14,029
Then at the end, when all
the other ponies were worn out...

285
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,461
...I sprinted to the finish.

286
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:21,011
I don't believe it. Twilight beat us!

287
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:24,429
Well, with all your horsing
around, it was quite easy.

288
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:29,209
You're right, Twilight.
Our behavior was just terrible.

289
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:31,946
We weren't very good sports.

290
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:34,893
Sounds to me like an important
lesson was learned.

291
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:37,014
PRINCESS CELESTIA?!

292
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:39,342
Wh... What are you doin' here?

293
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:41,514
Fall is one of my favorite seasons.

294
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:43,947
So I came to celebrate
the Running of the Leaves.

295
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:47,615
I'm sorry you had to see us being
such poor sport, Princess.

296
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,411
That's all right, Applejack.

297
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:52,960
Anypony can get swept up in the
excitement of competition.

298
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:57,893
It's important to remember that the friendship
is always more important than the competition.

299
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,033
Exactly, Twilight.

300
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:03,638
Now, unfortunately, because the two
of you were busy tricking each other...

301
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:08,649
...instead of shaking down leaves, many of
the lovely trees in Equestria are still covered.

302
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:12,634
Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those
leaves down for you lickety split.

303
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:15,808
Whaddya say, friend?
Wanna go for another run?

304
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:18,592
I'd love to stretch my legs!

305
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,874
