00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,330
Discord: Oh ho! But
that's not all!

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,700
When I went to look for them
again, they were on the ceiling!

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, Discord, I've never known
anypony as funny as you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,320
I love that story about the
time you tried to train your right paw...

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,000
...to fetch your left leg!

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,080
Oh, I do love our Tuesday Teas.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,120
And I can't wait for you to
meet my friend, Tree Hugger.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,050
She's going to love you, too.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,600
Tree Hugger? Ah ha ha!

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,020
I met her on a trip
to see the Breezies.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,070
She's a member of the Equestrian Society
for the Preservation of Rare Creatures.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,800
How nice for you.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,720
[crunch]

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,770
We're all going to have so much fun
together at the Grand Galloping Gala!

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,570
Oh! I was wondering when
you were going to ask me!

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,520
I'd love to!

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,570
Oh! Oh no.

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,470
Um. I'm afraid I've already
asked Tree Hugger.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,450
I'm sorry, Discord.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,270
I assumed you'd have your own ticket since
you and Princess Celestia are friends now.

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,030
Were you not invited?

22
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,620
Who, me? It probably got
lost in the mail.

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,950
No BIGGIE, as the foals say.
Well, gotta go!

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,820
But we haven't had any
of our Tuesday Tea cakes.

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,950
Well, I guess we're just goingto have to
EXCLUDE them from our party this time!

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,920
Oh! Oh, did I say that out lou--

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,450
I mean, ta ta.

33
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,170
Uh, she's in Canterlot, helping
Princess Celestia with the Gala.

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,350
I wouldn't miss this for
all the jewels in Equestria!

All right y'all, keep it down.

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,000
This is going to be
the best night ever!

47
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,670
Aaaah!

48
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,600
I don't suppose that uh, these adorable
little cutie pies have their own tickets

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,500
to the Gross Gruesome
Gala, do they?

50

[raspberry]

51
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,300
To answer your
rather rude question,

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,050
they're going as
our dates.

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,670
Our plus ones!

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,450
We're plus ones!

55
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,200
We're plus ones!

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
Yes, yes, yes.

57
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
I believe I got that!

58
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,220
Yeah!

59
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,500
Have a wonderful,
special, fantastic day!

60
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,350
Oh, hi Discord!
Want some cake?

61
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,450
I can give you a list of all
of the flavors we have

62
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,500
in order of most delicious

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,120
to incredibly,
unbelievably delicious!

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,570
Actually, Pinkie Pie, who
are you taking to...

65
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,950
I mean, do you...

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,670
Oh, you know what?
I AM famished!

67
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,300
I'll take all the cakes!

68
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,870
ALL OF THEM? HE WANTS
ALL OF THE CAKES!

69
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,820
Well, I'll need all my energy
when I'm dancing at the Gala...

70
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,570
IF I decide to go, that is.

71
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,300
Oh, by the way, are
you bringing anypony?

72
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,850
Oh, of course!

73
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,150
I WAS going to ask my mom
because she's, you know, MY MOM,

74
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,450
but it turned out she
didn't want to go,

75
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,620
so I started asking around and
around and around

76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,320
and I couldn't think of anypony and
I was about to just go by myself

77
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,800
but then I realized OF COURSE!

78
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,820
Who loves fancy, exciting
affairs more than anypony else?

79
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,470
My sister MAUD!

80
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,300
You know what?

81
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,120
Cancel my order!

82
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,750
You want NONE of
the cakes now?

83
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,420
Oh my, you are funny.

84
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,480
I guess every being in
Equestria is funny today.

85
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,650
Oh, how rude of me.

86
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,520
Tree Hugger, this
is Discord.

87
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,220
Discord, Tree Hugger.

88
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,850
Radical to meet you.

89
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,020
Really digging your vibe.

90
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,600
My vibe?

91
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,490
It's a compliment.

92
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh well, I'm
sure it is!

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,920
Well, I must be off!

94
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,950
It has nothing to do with
seeing you or not seeing you,

95
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,750
you can rest
assured of that!

96
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,600
Have fun at the Gala!

97
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,520
Righteous.

98
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,850
Oh, Tree Hugger, you're
such a great friend!

99
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,870
So much funnier than
unfunny old Discord!

100
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,050
No no, here, take my plus one!

101
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,700
I insist!

102
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,670
Before somepony else
thinks he's my friend

103
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,250
and expects to be
asked instead!

104
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,850
What's that?

105
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,870
You're worried Discord
might be upset?

106
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,620
Not a problem!

107
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,020
I can make more new
friends any time I want!

108
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,370
It's not as if any of
this actually mattered!

109
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,220
I don't even want to
go to the Gala anyway!

110
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,370
[screams from outside]

111
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,870
Are you perhaps looking for ME?

112
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,670
Are you...

113
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,120
..."Discord or
current resident?"

114
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,850
I can't find any street
numbers in this place.

115
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,370
My ticket to the
Grand Galloping Gala!

116
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,820
I WAS invited after all!

117
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,220
Why is this so late?

118
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,100
Well, I got a little lost after
I escaped the flying badgers.

119
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,270
Can you point me in the
direction of the bottomless pit?

120
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,870
I think I can make my
way back from there.

121
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,520
Oh, over there somewhere.

122
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,730
Just, just go over there.

123
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,200
Looks like I'll see you at the
Gala after all, Fluttershy.

124
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,800
But I can't show up alone.

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
She'll think that
she's my only friend!

126
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,870
Who could I bring on
such short notice?

[laugh]

128
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,300
I must say, it's been very nice
having you take over some of the

129
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,800
planning responsibilities
for this year's Gala.

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,370
Anything I can do to
make it easier on you.

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,600
Thank you, Twilight.

just enjoying the Gala for once.

What if you had a friend that you could
discuss chaos-based magic with?

355
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Would that mean we
weren't friends anymore?

356
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,300
No, I suppose not.

357
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,850
It would just mean that
I'd have different friends

358
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,950
for different things. Oh!

359
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,120
Oh dear.

360
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,120
It looks like I've perhaps
overreacted just a skosh.

361
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,750
More like a lot of skoshes.

362
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,600
Tree Hugger, could
you give us a minute?

363
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm just so new at this
whole friendship thing!

364
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,750
It's so much more
complicated than it looks.

365
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you think maybe you
owe somepony an apology?

366
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,620
Not ME!

367
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,500
Oh, oh.

368
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,520
Ahem, Yes, right.

369
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,970
Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you
got caught in the middle of my,

370
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,520
you know, wrath.

371
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,500
Oh, it's all groovy.

372
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,950
Um, I need like a few minutes
to clear out my chakras

373
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,220
before I can hug you from a
place of authenticity.

374
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,620
Oh, your chakras, yes.

375
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,370
Fair enough.

376
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,170
I owe you an apology, Smooze.

377
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,450
I spent the whole evening
thinking about my own feelings

378
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,500
and never thinking about yours.

379
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:37,950
Well, friends!

380
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:44,675
I think I may actually grow to
like this multiple friend thing!

381
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
I like it too.

382
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:49,750
Hey, it's not a party until
somepony spreads magic-resistant

383
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,075
ooze uncontrollably
over the ballroom!

384
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,950
Come on, Smoozinator,
let's dance!

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,125
♪♪

386
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,225
I'm sorry,
Princess Celestia.

387
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,600
I thought I could give
you a break tonight,

388
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,875
but it turns out I
was in over my head.

389
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:08,750
You have nothing
to apologize for.

390
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,350
This has been the most
fun Gala in years!

391
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,625
I know, it
was a-- WHAT?

392
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,925
But there was ooze
all over the place...

393
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,350
and one of the guests threatened to
send somepony to another dimension.

394
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,400
I know!

395
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,975
Can you imagine how dull it would
have been if I hadn't invited Discord?

396
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,375
Come on!

397
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,450
The night is still young!
