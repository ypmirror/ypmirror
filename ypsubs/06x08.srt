Hey, Starlight! Ready
to celebrate your first

37
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,360
Hearth's Warming Eve
here in Ponyville?

38
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,250
I was thinking I
might just skip it.

39
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,648
Derpy is Best Pony!

40
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,650
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies

41
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,430
SKIP HEARTH'S WARMING EVE?

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,250
I just find it all
a little silly.

43
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,930
It's mostly a day dedicated to
presents and candy, isn't it?

44
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,520
And why would you deny
yourself presents and candy?

45
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,870
That's crazy talk!

46
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,020
I THINK what Spike
means to say is,

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,950
Hearth's Warming is about
more than presents and candy.

48
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,340
It's a time to spend
with friends and family

49
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,260
when we celebrate a
very important day

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,680
in Equestria's history.

51
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,510
I think to most ponies,
it's just an excuse

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
for silly songs and fun,

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,370
not a day to remember
some old story.

54
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,670
Maybe you just haven't
heard the right

55
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,510
Hearth's Warming
Eve story yet.

56
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,310
Earth ponies, pegasi
and unicorns sing songs

57
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,690
around a hearth to fight
back an eternal winter

58
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,470
caused by the
mythical Windigos?

59
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,050
Every foal and fill
 knows that story.

60
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,280
Not THAT one. My
favorite holiday story.

61
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,000
A Hearth's Warming Tale.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Oooooo! I love that one!

63
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,600
This is the story of a powerful
unicorn named Snowfall Frost

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,570
who hated Hearth's
Warming Eve!

65
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,580
It all began many moons
ago in Canterlot...

66
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,920
Every home in Canterlot was
filled with Holiday spirit.

67
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,550
Every home except one.

68
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,670
It was said of Snowfall that
she was almost as studied

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,930
as Starswirl the Bearded.

70
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,650
Almost, since everypony knows
that Starswirl was an expert

71
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,500
at everything from
transfiguration,

72
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,960
Dimensional Calibration,
Teleportation--

73
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,390
We get it.
Starswirl's awesome.

74
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,610
Right. The point is, Snowfall
was also a powerful unicorn.

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,670
She wanted to be perfect.

76
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,200
Anything that got in the way
of that was a waste of time.

77
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,330
Ugh!

78
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,070
Well, that batch is
ruined. SNOWDASH!

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,780
Snowdash was Snowfall's
loyal assistant.

80
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,110
What do you need?

81
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,570
Get this mess cleaned up.

82
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,410
Those foolish ponies were
ringing those blasted bells

83
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,070
outside the window and
I lost my concentration.

84
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
Whoa. Ponies
actually enjoying

85
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,130
Hearth's Warming Eve. Where
did they get that crazy idea?

86
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,300
Today is nothing
to celebrate.

87
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,260
Hearth's Warming
Eve is a menace,

88
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,950
a dangerous day for
all of Equestria.

89
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,280
Dangerous? It's awesome!

90
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,980
It's the day we remember
how unicorns, pegasi,

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,010
and earth ponies came
together in friendship

92
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,880
to defeat the Windigos!

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,230
That silly legend
is the problem!

94
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,630
Telling everypony that
singing songs and being nice

95
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,200
will solve anything? I've
spent years studying magic

96
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,250
and that's not how it works.

97
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,810
I think you might be
missing the point.

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,140
Work hard, learn and use your
skills to better Equestria.

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,460
THAT'S a worthy
goal for anypony.

100
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,470
But by all means, if you
want to go home early,

101
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,090
ignore all of the work you
have and spend the rest --

102
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,250
SWEET!

103
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,000
Ugh.

104
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,250
I HATE Hearth's Warming Eve!

105
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,670
All of Equestria
would be better off

106
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,160
if we just skipped
the day all together.

And they'll have
me to thank for it!

146
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,750
Wait a minute.

147
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,160
Snowfall doesn't like
Hearth's Warming Eve

148
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,500
so she decides to cast a spell
to get rid of it all together?

149
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,540
That seems a little extreme.

150
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,390
Says the pony who tried
to make everypony the same

151
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,870
by replacing their cutie
marks with equal signs.

152
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,630
I THINK what Spike is trying
to say is that everypony

153
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,020
has their reasons for doing
things. Even Snowfall.

154
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,200
And if I could
continue the story,

155
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,180
we might just find
out what they are.

156
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,590
Proceed.

157
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,520
Snowfall was all set to cast
her spell that would erase

158
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,500
Hearth's Warming
Eve for all time

159
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,100
when a voice from the hearth
caught her attention.

160
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,530
You SURE you wanna
go through with this?

161
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,220
Who's there!

162
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,100
The Spirit of Hearth's
Warmin' Past, that's who.

163
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,130
And you and me have got
to have us a little chat.

164
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,300
A spirit! I didn't cast any
spirit-summoning spell.

165
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,250
What are you doing here?

166
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,360
You don't think a spell
like that would get by

167
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,320
without some powerful
forces noticing?

168
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,920
You've got our attention,
Snowfall Frost

169
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,430
and we've got some
pretty strong opinions

170
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,760
on this spell of yours.

171
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,590
We?

172
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,290
They'll be along in a bit.
For now it's just you and me.

173
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,690
Let's get a move on.
We got a ton to see

174
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,070
and barely any time
to see it.

175
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,190
I'm not going anywhere.

176
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,760
I've got a spell to cast. And
I don't need a history lesson

177
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,330
about Hearth's Warming Eve.

178
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,590
We aren't goin' to the past
to learn about the holiday.

179
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,410
We're goin' to
learn about you.

180
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,370

Looks like you're
not too upset it's

192
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,490

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,520
Just what do you think
you are doing, Snowfall?

198
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,720
Decorating the classroom
for Hearth's Warming Eve,

199
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,900
Professor Flintheart!

200
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,100
You said you wanted to learn
to be a powerful unicorn,

201
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
did you not?
I do!

202
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,830
And what is the way that one
becomes a powerful unicorn?

203
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,340
Work hard, learn
and use your skills

204
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,730
to better Equestria.

205
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,900
And how do these help
you to learn magic?

206
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,200
I want to be strong enough to
stop Windigos and help ponies!

207
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,770
That's just a story
we tell little ponies.

208
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,400
Real magic takes
time to learn.

209
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,450
It's your choice.

210
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,590
Spend your time learning to
become a powerful unicorn,

211
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,430
or play with your toys and
make nothing of yourself.

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,400

Spirit?
What am I supposed to--

226
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,970
SNOWFALL FROST! IT IS I,

227
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,330
THE SPIRIT OF HEARTH'S
WARMING PRESENTS!

228
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,160
Um, don't you mean
present, like, the time?

229
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,140
No. Toys, Hearth's Warming
dolls. Here! Want a cupcake?

230
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,610
Fine. Presents. All of
the pointless things

231
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,410
that ponies waste
their time on.

232
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,650
Oh Snowfall. It's not what
the gift is that matters,

233
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,570
it's what the gift MEANS!

234
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,810
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just stuff.

235
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,800
Exactly! Sometimes a
cupcake means I love you!

236
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,750
Or a toy means Hi!
How ya doin?

237
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,830
And sometimes a book means,
"Your mane looks AMAZING!"

238
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,260
And sometimes a scarf means...

239
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,060
well, a scarf usually
means you look cold.

240
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,490
That one's easy.

241
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,180
I don't understand
anything you're saying.

242
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
Whoa, whoa!

243
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,120
What's happening to you?

244
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,560
My Spirit of Hearth's Warming
Presents-sense is going off!

245
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,050

You know you're doing your
Pinkie Pie voice, right?

279
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,010
I was not...

280
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,000
So what happens next?

281
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,660
Well, the party was--

282
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,550
WAIT! Can we take
a quick break?

283
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,490
I need to refill my cocoa!

284
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,010
Fine.

285
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,190
But hurry up! We're
almost to the best part!

286
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,950
OK. I'm ready.

287
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,750
The party was in full swing.

288
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,300
Snowdash!

289
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,720
Hey, Merry.

290
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,480
Why, whatever is
the matter, darling?

291
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,780
Was it the eggnog?

292
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,350
I knew I put in too
much cinnamon.

293
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,350
Oh, no! The eggnog was
awesome, Flutterholly.

294
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,810
I'm just mad at somepony
who was complaining

295
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,890
about how awful
Hearth's Warming Eve is.

296
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,030
I don't suppose that pony's
name starts with "Snow"?

297
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,950
And ends with "frost"?

298
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,490
She said Hearth's Warming Eve
is just an excuse to party

299
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,130
and we'd all be better
off spending time working

300
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,250
to make Equestria
a better place.

301
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,080
Boo!

302
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,480
What does Snowfall think a
better Equestria looks like?

303
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,410
Ponies working hard.

304
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,190
Learning.

305
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,430
And using their abilities for
the benefit of Equestria.

306
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,351
Yeah!

307
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,260
It looks like we've got
everything on Snowfall's list

308
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,400
right here.

309
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,160
I think a perfect
Equestria looks a lot like

310
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,940
a Hearth's Warming Eve party.

311
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,590
Me too. Too bad it's going
to be the last one EVER!

312
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,830
Ever...ever...ever.

313
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,380
Spirit? What do you mean?
What's going to happen?

314
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,540
Who are you?

315
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,840
I am the Spirit of Hearth's
Warming Yet to Come.

316
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,240
Are you here to show me

317
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,400
what future Hearth's
Warming Eves are like?

318
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,130
No. For there are no more
Hearth's Warming Eves

319
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,220
for me to show.

320
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,450
Why not?

321
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,960
You will succeed in erasing
the holiday as you wished.

322
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,670
And what happens?

323
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,310

filly's story!

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,870
They are all too
real, Snowfall.

338
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,530
And your actions will
allow them to return.

339
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,970
The future of Equestria
shall be bathed in a blanket

340
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,460
of eternal snow.

341
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,440
No! I never meant for this to
happen. I didn't understand!

342
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,580
I didn't see how important
Hearth's Warming Eve was!

343
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,610
Please, spirit! I haven't
cast the spell yet!

344
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,890
Is there still time?
I'm sorry!

345
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,290
There's still time!

346
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,580
Oh my.

347
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,420
Snowfall Frost?

348
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,810
I was hoping I wasn't
too late for the party.

349
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,530
I brought gifts.

350
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,750
Boss?

351
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,493
I was wrong earlier. About
Hearth's Warming Eve.

352
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,040
It's not all about
singing and presents.

353
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,800
The singing and presents
are all about celebrating

354
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,310
the ponies in our lives.

355
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,790
The ponies we should listen
to more often. Our friends.

356
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,470
Wow.

357
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,060
Dragon toenail? Uh...thanks?

358
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,560
I was in a hurry. I'll
do better next time.

359
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,180
You kidding?

360
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,700
No one's ever given me
dragon toenail before!

361
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,410
It's awesome! Now
come get some eggnog!

362
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,180
<i> And from then on it</i>

Well, that's it. Thanks for
letting me read you the story.

367
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,300
Guess you can call
it a night.

368
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,220
Spike and I are
heading downstairs.

369
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,090
And if you wanted to, you'd
be welcome to join us.

370
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,890
Welcome to the party. Happy
Hearth's Warming Starlight.

371
