1
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:36,039
Perfect.

2
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,569
Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity.

3
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,839
Don't you all care about nothin'
other than prettifyin'?

4
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:48,566
Somepony has to.

5
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:52,153
You are making an absolute mess
of the town square, Applejack.

6
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:55,113
Yeah, well, the storm's gonna
make an even bigger mess...

7
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:58,843
...if we don't prune all these loose branches
so they don't tumble down on anypony.

8
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,754
I simply cannot imagine why the pegasus ponies
would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening...

9
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:06,527
...and ruin what could have been
a glorious sunny day.

10
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:10,624
Think more practical-like, will ya?

11
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,837
They accidentally skipped
a scheduled sprinkle last week, so...

12
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:16,415
...we need a doozy of a downpour
to make up for it, is all.

13
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,158
Oh no! My wonderfully styled
mane shall be ruined!

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,847
You shoulda hurried up and
finished the job, already.

15
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:27,828
It's coming down too fast!

16
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:30,093
Help me!

17
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:37,807
There. Hunker down to your heart's content
whilst I finish this.

18
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:43,320
Ooh, no no nooo!

19
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:45,893
What now?

20
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:48,240
I'd prefer not to get my hooves muddy.

21
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:51,532
Gah. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there?

22
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,471
Everything's gotta be just so.

23
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:57,354
Well, and how does muddying my hooves
serve any useful purpose?

24
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:59,787
You wouldn't know useful
if it came up and bit you.

25
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,132
That doesn't even make any sense.

26
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,561
-Does so.
-Does not.

27
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:04,989
-Does so.
-Does not.

28
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,401
-Does so.
-Does not.

29
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:08,522
Does so infinity. Hah!

30
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,632
Does not infinity plus one. Heh.

31
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:20,253
What's say we go our separate ways before
one of us says something she will regret?

32
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:24,201
I reckon y'all are gonna say
something you'll regret first.

33
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:28,985
On the contrary. I believe it shall almost certainly
be you who says something you will regret first.

34
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:31,734
-I'm not sayin' anythin'.
-Nor am I.

35
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,698
-You'll just be on your way then?
-After you.

36
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,117
Perhaps we should stick together
for now and find some shelter.

37
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,321
Uh-huh. Perhaps we should.

38
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:48,374
And fast.

39
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,859
Nice and dry under here.

40
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,786
Sorta.

41
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:40,214
Ooh! Unacceptable.

42
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:42,736
Applejack! Rarity!

43
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,273
Applejack! Rarity!

44
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:49,241
Twilight?

45
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,503
Come inside, girls, quick.

46
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:57,653
Whoa, Nelly.

47
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,870
Is inside a tree really the best place
to be in a lightnin' storm?

48
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:04,098
It is if you have a magical lightning rod
protecting your home like I do.

49
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,314
Come on in.

50
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,685
We are most grateful for your invitation.

51
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:11,613
Thank ya kindly for your hospitality.

52
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:15,882
Uh...

53
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:19,127
Do be a polite houseguest and
go wash up, please, von't you?

54
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:24,191
If I gotta spend one more second
with that fussbudget Rarity today...

55
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,643
...I can't be held responsible
for what I'm gonna do.

56
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:28,139
Some storm, huh?

57
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,168
The pegasus ponies sure have
outdone themselves this time.

58
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,941
I hope you and Applejack
don't have any trouble getting home.

59
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:36,649
It may indeed be a problem.

60
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,118
Well, you're welcome to stay if need be.

61
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,301
Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business.

62
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:42,964
I'm home all alone tonight.

63
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:46,340
You and Applejack should totally sleep over!

64
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:49,251
We'll have a slumber party.
I've always wanted one of those.

65
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,884
Oh! Oh, goodness.

66
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:56,073
Uh... I do believe I have another
engagement scheduled for this evening...

67
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:59,223
...that completely slipped my
mind until just now, hahahah.

68
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:02,456
Oh, silly me. I can't possibly stay here all night...

69
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,028
...with Applejack.

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,268
"Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know
About Slumber Parties (But Were Afraid to Ask)"

71
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:22,963
My own personal copy.
It's a fantastic reference guide.

72
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:24,664
You should see the table of contents.

73
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:28,210
I've been waiting for a chance to use it
and today is the day.

74
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:30,306
This is gonna be so great!

75
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:32,987
Yes, uh... Great.

76
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,493
What in tarnation?!

77
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,186
Now wait just a goll-darn minute.

78
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:02,340
You made me wash the mud off my hooves...

79
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:04,755
...but it's okay for y'all
to have mud all over your faces?

80
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:08,059
Silly. This is called a mud mask.

81
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,795
It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.

82
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:13,318
We're giving each other makeovers!

83
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,912
We have to do it. It says so in the book.

84
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,042
"Slumber 101: Everything You..."

85
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,685
Oh, hay. Would you look at the time.

86
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:27,421
I gotta skedaddle on home quick,
I'm powerful late for, uh...

87
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:28,253
...somethin'.

88
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,208
Uh, g'night!

89
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,956
Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell.

90
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:38,382
Hurray! Slumber party!

91
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:47,824
What in the world is this for?

92
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,157
To reduce the puffiness
around one's eyes, of course.

93
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,936
Puffiness-shmuffiness.

94
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:56,895
That's good eatin'.

95
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,742
Isn't this exciting?
We'll do everything by the book.

96
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:05,714
And that will make my
slumber party officially fun.

97
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,007
Did you hear that, Applejack?

98
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:13,271
You certainly would not want to do anything that
would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party...

99
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:14,629
...would you?

100
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:16,940
Of course not.

101
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,799
'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?

102
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:20,761
So do we have an agreement?

103
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,309
You betcha.

104
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,517
Oh! Gross!

105
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:29,725
You know, there's messy
and there's just plain rude.

106
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,251
You know, there's fussy and there's
just plain gettin' on my nerves.

107
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:39,442
Fortunately, I can get along with anypony,
no matter how difficult she may be.

108
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:40,568
Oh yeah?

109
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,750
Well, I'm the get-alonginest pony you're ever gonna meet.

110
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:45,598
That's not even a word.

111
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,660
This is gonna be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!

112
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,115
Yay.

113
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,380
Sooo...

114
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,710
How are you "getting along" over there, Applejack?

115
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,983
Just fine, Rarity

116
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,608
This is so awesome.

117
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:10,561
Makeovers: check.

118
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:18,071
Ooh! It says here we have to
tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?

119
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:19,195
Me!

120
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,119
I'd like to tell y'all a terrifying tale
of the prissy ghost...

121
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:27,867
...who drove everypony crazy
with unnecessary neatness.

122
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:33,083
I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one.

123
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:36,056
Never heard of it. But I have a much better one.

124
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:41,896
It's the horrifying story
of the messy, inconsiderate ghost...

125
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:46,292
...who irritated everypony
within the hundred miles.

126
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:51,082
That's not a real story. You made it up.

127
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,079
It is a ghost story. They're all made up.

128
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,313
I've got one!

129
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:03,374
This story is called
"The legend of the Headless Horse".

130
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:07,449
It was a dark and stormy night...

131
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,366
...just like this one. And three ponies
were having a slumber party.

132
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,439
Just. Like. This one.

133
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:22,279
...and just when the last pony
thought she was safe...

134
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:26,111
...there, standing right behind her.

135
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,566
Just inches away was...

136
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,842
The Headless Horse!

137
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,641
Ghost story: check.

138
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:45,761
Now, who wants s'mores?

139
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:50,745
...then you place one marshmallow
on the top of the chocolate...

140
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:52,339
...and be sure it's centered - that's critical...

141
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,838
...and then carefully put another
perfectly square graham cracker on the top.

142
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,369
Aaand... done! Ta-da!

143
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:02,616
Nah, you just eat 'em.

144
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:13,391
You could at least say "excuse me".

145
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:16,390
Oh, I was just about to
but you interrupted me.

146
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:18,337
Pardon.

147
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:20,853
S'mores: check.

148
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:23,315
Now, the next item of fun we have to do is...

149
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:24,623
...Truth of Dare.

150
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:29,675
I dare Applejack to do something
carefully and neatly for a change.

151
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:33,013
Oh yeah? Well, I dare Rarity to lighten up...

152
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:37,413
...and stop obsessin' over every
last little detail for a change.

153
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,651
I think the truth of the matter...

154
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:43,424
...is that somepony could stand
to pay a little more attention to detail.

155
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:47,652
And I think the truth is somepony
ought to quit with their fussin'...

156
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:49,701
...so the rest of us can get things done.

157
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:52,599
Um... I don't think this is
how the game's supposed to work.

158
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:57,758
"You have to give an honest answer to any question
or do whatever anypony dares you to do."

159
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:00,552
I dares you to step outside...

160
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:03,968
...and let your precious
tidy mane get ruined again.

161
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:07,527
You have to. It's the rule.

162
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:08,314
HA!

163
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,322
Fine!

164
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,379
Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress up...

165
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,958
..in a frou-frou glittery lacey outfit.

166
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:34,423
Happy?

167
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:35,529
Very.

168
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,124
Um... do I ever get a turn?

169
00:11:38,524 --> 00:11:41,411
I dare you to enter the next rodeo
when it comes to town.

170
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:44,611
I dare you *not* to enter the next rodeo
that comes to town.

171
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,473
I dare ya to not comb your mane
a hundred times for a bit!

172
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,598
And I dare you to comb yours just once!

173
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:53,383
I, uh... I think we should check off
Truth of Dare and move on.

174
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:56,161
Let's see what our next
fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we?

175
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:58,348
Hm... What does this mean?

176
00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:59,749
Pillow fight?

177
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:05,460
Oh, please. I am not at all interested
in participating in something so crude.

178
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:11,547
IT... IS... ON!

179
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:37,285
Oh, I get it!

180
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:39,392
Pillow-fight.

181
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:40,443
Fun!

182
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:47,503
Uh... girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch.

183
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:49,827
I will if she will!

184
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:51,848
She started it!

185
00:12:57,374 --> 00:13:00,310
Maybe we should just call it
a night and get some sleep.

186
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,500
Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.

187
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:10,944
My hooves ain't muddy.

188
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,814
They were. There might still be a little on them.

189
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,591
There ain't. See?

190
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,521
Now who's bein' inconciderate?

191
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,133
I have to make the bed again
so the blanket will be right.

192
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:28,814
Get up!

193
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:29,878
Hey!

194
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,066
Uh-uh-uh.

195
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,630
You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this.

196
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:50,424
Yeah... that's not gonna happen.

197
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:52,033
GERONIMO!

198
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:53,235
Hey!

199
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,609
You did that on purpose.

200
00:13:57,821 --> 00:13:59,358
Um.. yeah.

201
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:01,286
Get up so I can fix it again!

202
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:03,632
Can't hear ya, I'm asleep.

203
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,603
I ain't budgin'.

204
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:13,044
[You will if you want any blanket.]

205
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:17,158
[Give it back!]

206
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,344
[I will not!]

207
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:19,458
[Yes, you will!]

208
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,325
-[Won't!]
-[Will!]

209
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:22,920
-[Won't!]
-[Will!]

210
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,152
-[Won't!]
-[Will!]

211
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,833
ENOUGH!

212
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,777
It says right here that the number one thing...

213
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:31,583
...you're supposed to do at a
slumber party is have fun!

214
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:34,394
And thanks to you two I can't check that off.

215
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:37,343
I've been tryin' my darnest to get along!

216
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,477
No, it is I who have been trying *my* best.

217
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,527
-No, it was me!
-No, it was I!

218
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:43,622
-Me!
-I!

219
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,361
*I* hope you're happy. Both of you.

220
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,214
You've ruined my very first slumber party.

221
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:51,014
The makeover, the s'mores,
Truth of Dare, the pillow fight...

222
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,858
I mean, is there anything else
that could possible go wrong?

223
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:58,986
Sorry I asked.

224
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:16,554
You see? That's why we needed
to take down all those loose branches in town.

225
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,093
Not spiffy 'em up.

226
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:18,504
But I...

227
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,997
Out of my way, missy. Time's a-wastin'.

228
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,179
Wait! Stop! Don't!

229
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,771
No waitin'! No stopin'! Doin'!

230
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:33,817
And that, my friends, is what
we call gettin' 'er done.

231
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,995
I tried to tell you it would
come crashing down in here.

232
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,310
Well, you shoulda tried harder.

233
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:01,888
I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.

234
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,688
It's... well, it no okay!

235
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:08,297
It's a giant tree branch
in the middle of my bedroom!

236
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:12,180
And the book doesn't say anything about having
a giant tree branch in your slumber party.

237
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:14,084
Or at least I haven't found that entry yet.

238
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,677
What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?

239
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,176
Cleaning up this mess somepony made.

240
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:25,146
Who was that again? Oh, right. That's you.

241
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,584
We gotta do somethin'!

242
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:35,719
Baking... BFFs... Brothers...
There's nothing in here about branches!

243
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,492
Rarity, for pony's sake!

244
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:47,500
Stop sweatin' small stuff
and help me get rid of this thing!

245
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,121
I said hussle over here and help me!

246
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:55,400
Look...

247
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:57,938
I'm sorry, alright?

248
00:16:58,265 --> 00:16:59,232
What was that?

249
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,271
I said I'm sorry!

250
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:05,121
I shoulda listen to you when you noticed
where this here branch would end up.

251
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:09,258
You annoin' attention to detail
woulda save us from this whole mess.

252
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:14,089
But right now, you need to stop being so dang
fussy, pickin' up all those little things...

253
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,385
...and help me move the one big thing in here
that actually matters.

254
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:19,871
Please!

255
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:25,876
But I'll get all icky!

256
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:27,471
Consarnit...!

257
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:29,982
What a... You... I mean... Yes.

258
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,546
Ickiness is often a side effect of hard work.

259
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:37,274
But y'all need to get over it on account of
I just can't fix this mess I made myself.

260
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:39,591
I need your help.

261
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:46,835
Let's do this!

262
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:52,275
Well, they do have a section
about backyard slumber parties.

263
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:55,254
Is that what we're doing right now?
Does this count as camping?

264
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,653
I look awful.

265
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,176
Better?

266
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:42,302
Thanks.

267
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,647
Oh, pretty. Where did these come from?

268
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:54,469
They're not in the book either.

269
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,411
Is it bigger than a barn?

270
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,506
Nope.

271
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,307
Is it smaller than a saddle?

272
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:09,848
No. Only three of your twenty questions left.

273
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:13,511
Oh, we're never gonna guess
what you're thinkin' of. It could be anythin'.

274
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,346
Are we getting warmer?

275
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,766
Why? Is it too cold in here for you?
I can turn up the heat.

276
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:22,095
She means are we gettin'
any closer with our guesses.

277
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,365
Oh...! No.

278
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:27,743
And that technically counted as a question,
so only two more left.

279
00:19:29,054 --> 00:19:30,790
Is it...

280
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,967
...a sixed-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted
mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?

281
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:38,214
Who flies through the air all over
the world to hide magic sparkly eggs?

282
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,240
That's it!

283
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,922
It is?

284
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:43,845
No.

285
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:46,479
It's that.

286
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:51,255
But it was just so nice to see
you two finally getting along...

287
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,688
...I wanted you to be able to win together.

288
00:19:57,853 --> 00:20:01,417
See? We could have been
having fun like this all along.

289
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,272
If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.

290
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,168
Well, maybe she wouldn't have been
if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.

291
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:15,215
Sorry for bein' just a pain in the patootie.

292
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,660
Oh no, I'm sure I was much worse.

293
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:20,341
That's kind of you to say,
but I'm the one who's sorry.

294
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,373
Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.

295
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,126
-Are not.
-Are too.

296
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:25,602
-Are not.
-Are too.

297
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,250
-Are not.
-Are too.

298
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:34,614
I declare my first slumber party a success!

299
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:39,231
Have fun: check.

300
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:42,616
Now take two steps your left.

301
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,605
Uh, no. My left.

302
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:46,355
Whi... Which is it?

303
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,186
That mess is your fault, not mine.

304
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:54,281
Sorry.

305
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:55,994
"Dear Princess Celestia."

306
00:20:55,995 --> 00:21:01,132
"It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem
to have so little in common could ever get along."

307
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:04,275
"But I found out that if you embrace
each others differences..."

308
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:07,894
"...you just might be surpriced to
discover a way to be friends after all."

309
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,094
So...

310
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,421
Who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night?

311
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,159
How about a week from Thursday?

312
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:23,683
Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday?
A month from now?

313
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:33,876
