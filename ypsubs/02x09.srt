1
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:14,294
Here? I get to stay here?

2
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:17,216
Twilight Sparkle said you were
coming to Canterlot for a visit...

3
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,135
...and asked if
I might accommodate you.

4
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:21,378
Thank you so much, princess.

5
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,689
You're very welcome.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,801
No, really. This is so nice of you.

7
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:27,358
It's nothing, really.

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,331
Oh, but it isn't nothing.
It's everything.

9
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:31,891
I-I just don't know what to say
but thank you, thank you!

10
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:36,817
Thank you... Thank you...
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

11
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,700
-You are very welc...
-Thank you!

12
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:45,293
Your luggage, mademoiselle?

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,708
I'll leave you to get settled.

14
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:50,075
Your highness...

15
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,348
Enjoy your stay.

16
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:54,485
Thank you!

17
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,131
Where would you like me to put these?

18
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:02,435
That's perfect.

19
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:46,634
Opal, do you know what
I love about Canterlot?

20
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:51,022
Everything!

21
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:55,089
I may have been born in Ponyville,
but I am a Canterlot pony at heart.

22
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:58,598
Now I know that we are here
to pick up some fabrics for the shop...

23
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,255
...but Twilight was such a dear
to get me that suite at the castle...

24
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:04,535
...I simply must make her something
to express my gratitude.

25
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:06,922
Ooh!

26
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:10,318
An outfit for her birthday party
this weekend! Perfect!

27
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,946
Don't you just love it
here, Opalescence?

28
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,737
Please excuse our interruption.

29
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:23,995
I'm Jet Set and this
is my wife, Upper Crust.

30
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:27,515
We saw you from across the café
and just have to find out...

31
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:30,969
Where did you get that
simply marvelous chapeau?

32
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:34,061
Huh, this old thing?
Oh, it's just something I...

33
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,471
Rarity!

34
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:37,880
Hey, Rarity!

35
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:43,627
It's me! Hayseed Turnip Truck!

36
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:46,177
We met at the big hoedown
in Ponyville last month.

37
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:49,652
Oh... Yes... Of course. How are you?

38
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:51,833
Good! Real good!

39
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,515
You're from... Ponyville?

40
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,475
Well, ye... yes, but...

41
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:03,836
She sure is! She's a real big time
fancy pants dressmaker there.

42
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:06,682
Probably made that real purty
thing she's got on her head.

43
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:09,885
I thought it looked a little... country.

44
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:13,760
I told you it wasn't something you
could get here in Canterlot, dear.

45
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:19,586
Well, they seemed real nice.

46
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:27,154
"Looked a little country."

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,225
"Not something you could
get in Canterlot."

48
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,192
I'll show you something
worthy of Canterlot!

49
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:42,489
I have to get started right away.

50
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,344
This new design is very ambitious...

51
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:46,074
...and I've already written
to Twilight to let her know...

52
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:48,932
...she'll have something beyond
fabulous to wear to her party.

53
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,921
Fancypants?

54
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,814
I say, that's one way
to make the introduction.

55
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:02,828
Oh, goodness!

56
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:06,909
I am so sorry. I didn't see you there.
I've just got so many bags...

57
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,810
...and I was trying to get back
to my suite at the castle and...

58
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,029
You're staying at the castle?

59
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,007
Wh... The princess invited me
to stay in one of the suites.

60
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,273
You know the princess?

61
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:20,655
Hmm... A pony with
expensive taste, I see.

62
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,673
Oh... It's for an ensemble
I'm making for a friend.

63
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,552
Her birthday is in a few days.

64
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:28,888
Again, I am really sorry
I bumped into you.

65
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:30,705
I'm not.

66
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,350
You are obviously somepony
worth bumping into.

67
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,645
Uh, listen. I have a VIP box reserved
at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon.

68
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,453
Would you... Would you be so kind...

69
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:44,691
...as to join me and a few
of my companions there, hmm?

70
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:45,411
Me?

71
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:46,735
But of course, my dear.

72
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:49,997
Well, I'm... uh... I'm not sure.

73
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,332
We'd love to see you there, uh...

74
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,584
Rarity.

75
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,451
...Rarity.

76
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:04,101
Pro: seeing the derby from a VIP box
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

77
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:06,533
Con: going to the derby cuts
into the amount of time...

78
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,249
...I have to finish Twilight's outfit.

79
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,114
Pro: Fancypants is *the* most
important pony in Canterlot.

80
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:14,767
His stamp of approval could
mean big things for me here.

81
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:18,122
Con: Twilight's party might not be
as sophisticated as a derby...

82
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,959
...but that doesn't mean
I shouldn't put all of my energy...

83
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,641
...into creating her birthday ensemble.

84
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,637
My Ponyville friends will appreciate
my hard work more than anypony.

85
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,055
I hate to let them down.

86
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,146
And I won't.

87
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:36,310
Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts
Derby as a guest of Fancypants.

88
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,510
Pardon me.. Excuse me... Excuse me...

89
00:05:55,675 --> 00:06:00,303
Rarity! Jolly good to see you!
So glad you could make it.

90
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,178
Everypony, this is Rarity.

91
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:13,883
She is staying at Canterlot Castle.

92
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,023
Fillies and gentlecolts!

93
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:21,464
Welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby!

94
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,727
The competitors are taking their
places at the starting line...

95
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:26,574
...and the race will begin momentarily.

96
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,685
I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course.

97
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:31,157
He's sure to take home the grand prize.

98
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:34,799
I don't think he has
a chance against Fleetfoot.

99
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,344
And it's Fleetfoot by a nose!

100
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:53,151
Bravo, Rarity!

101
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:56,116
I say, how did you know
Fleetfoot would be victorious?

102
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,577
My friend Rainbow Dash
talks about her all the time.

103
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:01,863
She says what Fleetfoot lacks
in size, she makes up for in speed.

104
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:05,639
And who is this Rainbow Dash?

105
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,551
Why... she's...

106
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:16,009
She's the... the Wonderbolts'
trainer, of course.

107
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:22,124
Staying at Canterlot Castle AND she knows
the pegasus training the Wonderbolts!

108
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,297
I told you all this was
an important pony.

109
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:32,990
Three cheers for Rarity,
my new favorite party guest.

110
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:38,620
Hip hip, hurray! Hip hip, hurray!
Hip hip, hurray!

111
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,793
...and then I said: "Please,
that isn't a hat, darling."

112
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:46,495
"That's a natural disaster, that
somehow landed atop your head!"

113
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:54,050
Oh, you are a delight, Rarity.
An absolute delight.

114
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:57,785
You simply must attend my
art gallery opening this evening.

115
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:00,434
Oh. I'd love to, but I...

116
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:04,124
And let's not forget my charity
auction tomorrow morning.

117
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,797
That sounds wonderful, but I...

118
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:09,850
And of course there's a seat for you
at my dinner party tomorrow night.

119
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:12,324
I'm flattered. Really.

120
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,399
It's just I have a project I really
need to get started on and...

121
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Oh, but Rarity!

122
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:21,715
I may as well close down the whole
gallery if you can't attend!

123
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:25,088
My auction is for charity,
dear. For charity!

124
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,278
And my dinner party will be
a disaster if you don't come.

125
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,422
Of course I'll be there.

126
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:35,416
-Wonderful!
-Disaster averted.

127
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,297
Looks like we'll be spending a few
more days here, Opalescence.

128
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,336
Turns out bumping into
Fancypants like that...

129
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:46,991
...was the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

130
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:48,934
Of course finishing
Twilight's dress in time...

131
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:51,983
...for her birthday party
is still my top priority.

132
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,557
But I can't possibly disappoint
the Canterlot elite...

133
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:57,697
...by rejecting their
invitations, now can I?

134
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:09,872
<i>I'll be the toast of the town,
the girl on the go</i>

135
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:13,899
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

136
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,836
<i>I'll be the one to watch,
the girl in the flow</i>

137
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:22,005
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

138
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:26,538
<i>Becoming as popular
as popular can be</i>

139
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:31,149
<i>Making my mark, making my mark
in high society</i>

140
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,778
<i>I'm the belle of the ball,
the star of the show, yeah</i>

141
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:40,035
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

142
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:45,037
<i>See how they hang on
every word that I speak</i>

143
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:49,039
<i>My approving glance
is what they all seek</i>

144
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,792
<i>I'm the crème de la crème,
not just another Jane Doe</i>

145
00:09:53,793 --> 00:10:00,160
<i>And the type of pony
everypony should know</i>

146
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,239
<i>At home, at the opera,
on a fancy yacht</i>

147
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,117
<i>Becoming the talk,
the talk of all of Canterlot</i>

148
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:12,883
<i>I'm the crème de la crème,
not just another Jane Doe, yeah</i>

149
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:20,099
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

150
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:27,498
<i>Because I'm the type of pony</i>

151
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:31,168
<i>Yes, I'm the type of pony</i>

152
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:46,282
<i>Yes, I'm the type of pony
everypony should know</i>

153
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:51,646
Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.

154
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,733
Me... too...

155
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:56,243
We better get going.
I must get back to Ponyville...

156
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:58,757
...with enough time
to finish Twilight's ensemble.

157
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:02,246
For me?

158
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,508
"Dearest Rarity, your
presence is requested..."

159
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:07,565
"...at the Canterlot Garden
Party tomorrow afternoon."

160
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,903
"Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust."

161
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,929
The Canterlot Garden Party!

162
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,685
Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is
*the* premier event of Canterlot!

163
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:21,285
Ooh. But if I go,
I'll miss Twilight's birthday.

164
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,321
But if I don't go, my new
reputation in Canterlot...

165
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:27,507
...as a Very Important
Pony might be ruined!

166
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:31,139
I might never be invited to another
high society event again!

167
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,367
Friend's birthday – Very Important Pony...

168
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,431
It's just too important.

169
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,343
"My dear Twilight. I am afraid..."

170
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:46,994
"...I won't be able to make it
to your birthday party tomorrow..."

171
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,437
"...because..."

172
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:51,387
Because poor Opal is quite ill!

173
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:55,815
And she is in no condition to make
the long journey back to Ponyville.

174
00:11:55,816 --> 00:12:01,370
"I do hope you understand.
Your friend, Rarity."

175
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:04,597
I suppose this means you don't
need me to bring down your bags?

176
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,430
No.

177
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:08,127
But I will need some
help unpacking them.

178
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:13,566
What do you think? Too much?

179
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,121
You're right. Too little.

180
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:20,045
Garden party, here I come!

181
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:22,596
SURPRISE!

182
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:29,653
And SWOOSH! And right before
she hit the ground, SHOOM, she...

183
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:30,574
Hi again!

184
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:33,645
W-What are you...
How did you... Why are you...

185
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:37,293
Listen to her. She's so excited
to see us, she can hardly talk.

186
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:40,461
What I mean to say is,
what are you all doing here?

187
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:43,205
When I got your letter saying
you were stuck in Canterlot...

188
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,693
...I asked Pinkie Pie if it
wouldn't be too much trouble...

189
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:48,739
...to move my birthday party here,
so you wouldn't have to miss it.

190
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,607
Balloons are super easy to pack.

191
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:58,964
Wow. First you get me a suite
at Canterlot Castle and now this...

192
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,426
I don't know what to say, Twilight.

193
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:05,533
How about you start by saying what
you're doing in that fancy getup.

194
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,147
This? Uh.. Well, I...

195
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,150
I always put on something a little fancy
when Opal's feeling under the weather.

196
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:14,539
Cheers her right up.

197
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:19,389
Oh, poor Opal.
Where is the sick darling?

198
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,258
Oh, uh... she's...

199
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,459
Hold on a minute.

200
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:28,894
I am so sorry about this.

201
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:37,925
She's resting on the bed.

202
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:41,762
Poor baby. She looks awful.

203
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,146
Is that my dress?

204
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,631
Yes...

205
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:52,003
It's so simple. So practical.

206
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:53,649
So... ME!

207
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,212
It's the perfect dress
for my birthday party!

208
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:57,771
I love it!

209
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:02,171
You don't know how glad
I am to hear you say that.

210
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:08,703
When I told the princess that I was
moving the party to Canterlot...

211
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:12,442
...she was kind enough to offer us
the Canterlot Castle ballroom.

212
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:15,775
Isn't it fancy pants?

213
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,063
Fancypants!

214
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,334
Where?!

215
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,306
I... mean...

216
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:24,801
...where did you find the time
to put up all these decorations?

217
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:30,149
Oh, I never leave home
without my party cannon!

218
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,310
Ta-da!

219
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:37,209
I thought about having
my birthday outside...

220
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,411
...but they're having another party
on the castle grounds today.

221
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,687
LET'S PARTY!

222
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:19,250
No reason I can't at least
make an appearance.

223
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,097
I'm here!

224
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:35,073
Darling, I'm so glad you made it.

225
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,358
Rarity! So happy to see you here.

226
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:41,021
I wouldn't have missed
this for the world.

227
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,971
I say, what is that
scent you're wearing?

228
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:48,310
It smells like...
Is that cake frosting?

229
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:53,098
Yes, I always dab a little frosting
behind my ears before I go out.

230
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:58,070
After all, who doesn't like
the smell of cake frosting?

231
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,444
I know I do.

232
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:05,441
Well, all this talk about cake
has made me hungry.

233
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,962
Think I'll go and see what's
on the hors d'oeuvre table.

234
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:09,733
If you'll excuse me...

235
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,584
-I must say, you do look like a...
-Oh, yes, darling.

236
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:52,161
I think I left the bath water
running in my suite.

237
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:55,051
I really should go check on Opal.

238
00:16:55,302 --> 00:16:57,297
Is that Princess Celestia?

239
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:59,454
I need to use the little filly's room.

240
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:01,107
Can I get anypony more punch?

241
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:03,561
I... have to go to do the...

242
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,904
...thing with the... stuff, you know.

243
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,406
Uh... What's with the croquet mallet?

244
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,552
-[What croquet mallet?]
-Duh! The one in your mouth.

245
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:16,359
Oh, that croquet mallet.

246
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,808
I... well, I... you know,
the truth is... the truth is...

247
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,149
Were you at that other
party in the garden?

248
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,902
I... I... I...

249
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,657
Rarity, I'm surprised at you.

250
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:30,571
Twilight, let me explain! I...

251
00:17:30,572 --> 00:17:33,309
I hadn't realized you were
such a savvy businesspony.

252
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,592
You must understand! I...

253
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:37,827
All of those ponies look so posh.

254
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:40,074
And with the Grand
Galloping Gala coming up...

255
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:42,907
...I bet you could totally get
some of them to buy your dresses.

256
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:44,721
Very smart.

257
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:48,297
Wh... wwwhyyy, yes! Uh...

258
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:50,867
I didn't want you to think
I was being rude...

259
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:53,508
...so that's exactly
the reason I didn't tell you.

260
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,644
The one and only reason.

261
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:59,065
Oh, well. You didn't have to do that.

262
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,330
You should totally go
over there and mingle.

263
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:06,248
Twilight, you really are the best
friend a pony could ever ask for.

264
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:09,826
I don't know why I ever thought
you wouldn't understand.

265
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,005
Understand what?

266
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,085
Nothing!

267
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:13,383
See you girls later!

268
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,863
Hey, wait up!

269
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:19,505
We're your friends. I'm sure they won't
mind if we check out the party too.

270
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:23,787
Come on, you guys! Let's show 'em
how to party Ponyville style!

271
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,993
Oh no!

272
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,289
How come y'all aren't
doin' any gardenin'?

273
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,694
This is a garden party, isn't it?

274
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,514
Can you believe what
that pony is wearing?

275
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,047
It's just so plain.

276
00:19:10,043 --> 00:19:10,959
Yeah...

277
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:16,805
Excuse me. Might I ask where
you got you ensemble?

278
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:18,804
Why, yes. Yes, you may.

279
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:22,798
A very, very close friend of mine
from Ponyville made it for me.

280
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,403
Ponyville? You don't say.

281
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:30,652
I do say. Her name is...

282
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,053
Fancypants! Come with me.

283
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:34,897
I'd like to show you...
this thing that's over there.

284
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:36,261
On the other side of the room.

285
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,876
In a moment, my dear.

286
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:41,527
This lovely filly from Ponyville
was just about to tell me...

287
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,255
...who made her charming dress.

288
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:46,668
That dress? Oh, come now.
Who cares? It's just a plain old...

289
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,268
Oh, don't be so modest.

290
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,428
This dress you made is beautiful.

291
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,071
We all think so.

292
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:59,913
You know these ponies?

293
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,033
Yes. Yes, I do know them.

294
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:18,475
They may not be as sophisticated
as some of you Canterlot ponies...

295
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:21,889
...but they are my best friends
and they are without a doubt...

296
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,689
...the most important ponies I know.

297
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:28,845
"Important ponies"? These ruffians?

298
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:31,226
Don't make me laugh.

299
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,354
I, for one, find them charmingly rustic.

300
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:40,734
And I think the dress you made
for your friend is lovely.

301
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:44,908
I dare say every mare
in Canterlot will be wanting one.

302
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:48,050
Oh, I'd like to place my order right now.

303
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:50,186
I think you should get two, hmm?

304
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:52,829
Uh, yes. Now then...

305
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,184
How about you introduce me
to your friends?

306
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:58,062
With pleasure.

307
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:01,431
"Dear Princess Celestia."

308
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:05,880
"I wanted to tell you about the important
lesson I learned during my visit."

309
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:08,255
Now that I would like to hear.

310
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:11,178
I learned that no matter
where you go in life...

311
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,997
...you should never forget that you are
the product of your home and your friends.

312
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:18,881
And that is something always
to be proud of, no matter what.

313
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,748
A very valuable lesson to have learned.

314
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,076
It certainly is...

315
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:27,755
...but might I ask that
we hurry things up a bit?

316
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:29,706
Oooh nooo!

317
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:36,413
