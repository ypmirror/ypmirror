1
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:11,683
You look nervous. There's
no reason to be nervous.

2
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:14,758
Nothing to worry about.
Everything's gonna be fine.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,874
Twilight, tell those butterflies
in your tummy to "beat it!"

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,323
Making new friends
is always fun!

5
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:21,676
Oh!

6
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:24,708
They're probably just
as nervous as you are.

7
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:27,066
You've been planning
this shindig for weeks.

8
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:30,217
You know everything about these
fellers. It's gonna be dandy.

9
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:35,432
You're right. Remember,
Equestria and Yakyakistan

10
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,657
haven't opened their borders
for hundreds of moons.

11
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,712
In fact, Yakyakistan is so far
north of the Crystal Mountains,

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,483
nopony's even BEEN there.

13
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:45,260
Imagine the look on
Princess Celestia's face

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,832
when she finds out we made
friends with a Yak Prince!

15
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:48,327
Ha ha!

16
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:50,822
I'm calm. I'm calm.

17
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,398
PONIES! GREETINGS, PONIES!

18
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:11,817
Prince Rutherford, Your Majesty,

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,091
on behalf of all of us, I
welcome you to Equestria.

20
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:19,481
Me honored. Yaks hope
for great friendship

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,500
between Ponies and Yaks.

22
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:23,889
Friends for a thousand moons!

23
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,325
You must be hungry
after your long journey.

24
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:32,906
We've prepared a banquet
of traditional yak foods.

25
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:37,580
IF THINGS NOT
PERFECT, YAKS GET MAD!

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,944
YAKS ALWAYS GET MAD
WHEN THINGS NOT PERFECT!

27
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:52,430
THIS NO TASTE LIKE YAK FOOD!
FAKE PONY FOOD MAKE YAKS MAD!

28
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,295
Is it OK to be nervous now?

29
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:19,400
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

30
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,868
Them yaks sure have a
funny way of saying howdy.

31
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:56,617
They're different, that's all.

32
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:58,560
Very different.

33
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,304
I think they broke my record

34
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:02,460
for Most Stuff Broken
in Under a Minute.

35
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:04,777
I mean, they even
broke the trophy.

36
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,184
All we have to do is show them

37
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,036
how great it can be
to have friends before

38
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,649
Princess Celestia arrives for
the friendship party tonight.

39
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:14,914
Now, who read the seven-volume
cross-indexed history

40
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,655
of Yakyakistan I recommended?

41
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,824
I - I had a thing.

42
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,556
I did! I did! Did you know
they live so far North

43
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,754
of the Crystal Empire that
it's cold all the time?

44
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:27,135
Yaks have yak fur
to keep them warm!

45
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,754
Pretty sure that's what fur's
always for, Pinkie Pie.

46
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:33,474
I KNOW! YAKS ARE SO COOL!

47
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:37,432
Pinkie Pie, can you
show them around town?

48
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:39,649
I know you have to plan
the friendship party too,

49
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,729
but it would really help
make them feel welcome.

50
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,243
Don't worry. They'll be
in good hooves with me.

51
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:47,649
Remember, we want to make sure
Equestria feels like home.

52
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:49,565
That means doing
everything we can

53
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:51,805
to make this place
feel like Yakyakistan.

54
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:53,158
No problem!

55
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,590
Good. Let's get out there
and make some new friends.

56
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,876
We know y'all are noble warriors

57
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,161
who avoid the
so-called finer things,

58
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,516
so me and my family'd be honored

59
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:10,228
if you rested here in the
barn during your visit.

60
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,540
Applejack and I made hay beds

61
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:14,681
like you're used to
back in Yakyakistan.

62
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:18,160
HM. THIS PERFECT.

63
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,304
You can snooze
here all afternoon

64
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,390
cause you're gonna need a lot
of energy for my party tonight.

65
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:25,619
That wasn't so hard.

66
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:26,674
WAIT!

67
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,630
THIS NOT YAK HAY!

68
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:33,211
Well, we didn't have actual
hay from Yakyakistan,

69
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:35,828
but we tried our best to
make it just like yours--

70
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:38,952
NOT PERFECT! YAKS DESTROY!

71
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,443
Pinkie Pie, what do we do?

72
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,870
And now, for your
entertainment pleasure,

73
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:55,588
presenting, "Animals,
Yakyakistan Style."

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,613
ANIMALS CUTE!

75
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,746
OH. Thank goodness.

76
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:12,838
WAIT. THESE ANTLERS A LIE!
THESE NOT YAKYAKISTAN ANIMALS!

77
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:14,735
YAKS SMASH!

78
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:26,190
OK, well, there's still other
things we can do...I think.

79
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:31,291
Yes, these are some of my
favorite materials, very rare,

80
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:32,864
imported from the Crystal Empire

81
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,483
to match your Northern
sensibilities.

82
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:36,125
I hope you'll find them...

83
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:39,980
delicious.

84
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,411
This no taste like yak fabric!

85
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,114
YAKS DESTROY!

86
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,066
Everything's gonna be fine;

87
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:57,337
you just make it
up to them somehow.

88
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,504
Listen up! Tell your faces
to hold onto their frowns,

89
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:04,426
cause they're about to
get turned upside down.

90
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,674
HOLD YOUR FROWN, FACE!

91
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,207
Hit it, Rainbow Dash!

92
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:15,131
Just like Yakyakistan
snow, right?

93
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:18,220
Because snow is snow, no
matter where it comes from.

94
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,742
THIS NOT YAK SNOW!

95
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:28,948
Seriously?

96
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:30,586
Seriously?

97
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:38,586
You know? It's going OK.

98
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:40,792
Satisfactory, I'd say.

99
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,880
It could be better.

100
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,226
It's not very good.

101
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,375
It's a disaster!

102
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:50,232
Pinkie Pie. Tonight's
Yakyakistan-theme party

103
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:51,615
is more important than ever.

104
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,883
You'll make them forget all
about this afternoon, right?

105
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:57,828
Because if it's not perfect,

106
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,680
they're going to
smash everything,

107
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:02,895
and I'm not sure how much more
smashing this visit can take!

108
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,348
I definitely will,
I think... maybe?

109
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:10,278
You're the best gosh-darn
party planner in Equestria.

110
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,262
You'll show 'em a good time.

111
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:13,923
You can do it.

112
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:17,249
We have absolute confidence in
your abilities, Pinkie Pie.

113
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:21,013
It's going to be my most
happy-tacular party ever...

114
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,897
I hope!

115
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,304
Why are your eyes
darting around like that?

116
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:29,840
It's what I do when I'm not
nervous! Hahahahahahaha!

117
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,470
Pinkie Pie, I don't know
what we'd do without you.

118
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:34,739
Me either! GOTTA GO!

119
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:46,510
Gummy! What am I gonna do?

120
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,666
I have all this amazing
stuff planned for the party

121
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,706
but they're going to hate it!

122
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,196
There's no way to make Equestria
feel like Yakyakistan.

123
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,137
They're just too sensitive.

124
00:07:56,491 --> 00:08:01,996
Even Fluttershy made
them mad. FLUTTERSHY!

125
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:05,306
Oh, I need a new idea,
and I need it now.

126
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:08,449
How am I supposed to make this
party feel like Yakyakistan

127
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:11,200
without actually going there
and bringing something back?

128
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:17,043
Gummy, you're a genius!

129
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:21,961
And this is Sugarcube Corner.

130
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,207
They're working hard to make you
a traditional Yakyakistan cake.

131
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,163
VANILLA EXTRACT
BALANCE VERY TRICKY!

132
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:32,838
Do you mind, um, waiting
here for one moment?

133
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:35,481
How's tonight's party coming?

134
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm doing what I can, but it's
really up to you at this point.

135
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:43,756
Pinkie? Where are you?

136
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,127
Did you find her?

137
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,371
Angel and I searched
the forest, but...

138
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,963
Aerial recon turned
up nothing, either.

139
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:02,445
I searched the farm inside
and out. No Pinkie Pie.

140
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,100
But I did find a set of
Granny Smith's dentures

141
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,662
under the house. So...not
a complete loss.

142
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:10,540
She's simply vanished!

143
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:14,057
But the party, it's all we have
left. What are we going to do?

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,179
"Don't worry. I'll be back
in time for the party.

145
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,893
Love, Pinkie Pie."

146
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,577
If Pinkie Pie says she'll be
back in time for the party,

147
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:28,365
she'll be back.

148
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:32,198
We have to trust her. Right?
No reason to FREAK OUT.

149
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:34,483
Don't worry, Twilight.

150
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:35,763
When it comes to parties,

151
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,714
I think she knows
what she's doing.

152
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:42,647
You're right, let's just focus
on keeping the yaks happy

153
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:43,466
till she's back.

154
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,146
Piece of cake.

155
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,241
The cake!

156
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,493
One bite and you'll
be transported

157
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:53,123
right back to
Yakyakistan. Ha ha!

158
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,068
I hope.

159
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:03,299
PONIES TOO HEAVY ON
VANILLA EXTRACT! BWAR!

160
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,769
We've never needed
a party so badly.

161
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:15,584
Next stop, Crystal Empire!

162
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:20,377
And so my quest begins.

163
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,984
I know what you're thinking:

164
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,933
"Why go to Yakyakistan
alone, Pinkie Pie?"

165
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:27,428
Because I'm the party planner.

166
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:32,099
This burden falls on my
rump, and my rump alone.

167
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:33,855
If I want a great party,

168
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,784
I gotta climb the mountains
North of the Crystal Empire,

169
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,203
find Yakyakistan, and come
back with something authentic.

170
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:42,780
Know what I mean?

171
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:49,794
Did we go the wrong way?

172
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:51,939
Where's all the snow?

173
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,975
Please tell me this is
magical sand-colored snow!

174
00:10:56,518 --> 00:11:00,144
Pthew! Nope! Sand.
Definitely sand.

175
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,020
Dodge City. End of
the line, I'm afraid.

176
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:06,430
All trains had to stop. Sheep
decided to sit on the tracks.

177
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:09,782
CURSE YOU, SHEEP!

178
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,653
Thanks for your help, Conductor.

179
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,161
Cherry Jubilee!

180
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,609
Pinkie Pie? I reckoned
I eyeballed you

181
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,060
crossin' my way right now.

182
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:25,344
How ARE you? You look
amazing! I need help!

183
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:28,666
I'm dandy as a daffodil
and fit as a floribunda.

184
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,125
What can I do ya for?

185
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:31,992
Have you heard of Yakyakistan?

186
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,958
Do you have ANY idea
how I could get there?

187
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:35,542
Mark your calender, missy,

188
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,680
cause this right
here's your lucky day.

189
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:41,203
I'm headin' north to the Crystal
Empire myself for a delivery.

190
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,916
I oughta warn you, though. Me
and the boys are powerful tired

191
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:48,312
cause we was up all
night countin' cherries.

192
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,156
Hey there! Wake up!

193
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,784
Counting cherries? How many?

194
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,640
Four hundred and
seventeen thousand,

195
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:57,630
two hundred and
thirty-four. YEE-HAW!

196
00:11:57,664 --> 00:11:58,434
Whoa!

197
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:03,714
And so my quest resumes.

198
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,780
As I stare across
the endless desert,

199
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,365
I tell myself I will soon
triumphantly enter the homeland

200
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:13,032
of our noble guests
and return with a prize

201
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,550
to make the best party
they've ever seen.

202
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:16,849
You know what I mean?

203
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:19,390
Cherry?

204
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:28,045
RAVINE! RAVINE!

205
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,297
WAKE UP!

206
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,160
WAKE UP!

207
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,396
STOP!

208
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:53,813
Whoa! I was dreamin'
about a ravine.

209
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:58,392
RAVINE!

210
00:12:59,074 --> 00:12:59,881
That's what I said!

211
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:22,777
MUSIC BEAUTIFUL! MUCH SOUL!

212
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,036
Phew.

213
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,984
When Twilight told me to
stall, I mean,entertain you,

214
00:13:30,003 --> 00:13:32,316
I thought "there's
NO way I could--"

215
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,758
Huh?

216
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:39,546
Spike!

217
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,560
PIANO PLAY ITSELF?

218
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:46,201
MUSIC A LIE! BWAR!

219
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:55,554
WE DEMAND PARTY! PARTY
NOW, OR YAKS NO FRIENDS!

220
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:58,175
No! Just a little longer!

221
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,872
NO MORE LONGER! WE LEAVE NOW!

222
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:04,339
YAKS GO GET TRAIN!
RETURN WITH MORE YAKS!

223
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,779
WE DECLARE WAR!

224
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,927
No Pinkie Pie? What's this?

225
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:23,916
Heh heh. We panicked and
tried to plan our own party.

226
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:27,512
It's sorta panic-themed.

227
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,104
The yaks are going
home! This is awful!

228
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:33,961
I wanted to surprise
Princess Celestia.

229
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,935
Now the only surprise is that I
may have just started a war.

230
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,022
There we were, face to face
with Falling Pony Ravine.

231
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:48,407
Down! Down! Down! And
then suddenly-- POW!

232
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:50,468
We were rescued MID-AIR
by the Wonderbolts!

233
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,179
And then they gave me
a ride to Manehattan

234
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:53,413
where I joined a travelling band

235
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,459
and we played some shows
here and there, got popular,

236
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,036
almost made it big until
creative differences

237
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:57,988
tore us apart.

238
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:01,120
And that's when I knew I had
to get back on with my journey

239
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:04,579
to the Crystal Empire, the
gateway to Yakyakistan!

240
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:08,464
And so, here I am! It
was a major adventure

241
00:15:08,537 --> 00:15:10,678
that took most of the afternoon.

242
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:12,091
You know what I mean?

243
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:16,022
This is it: the northern
boundary of the Crystal Empire.

244
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,400
Beyond lies Yakyakistan.

245
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:21,820
Nopony who's attempted this
climb has ever returned.

246
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,965
Are you sure you
have to do this?

247
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:25,093
I do.

248
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:27,009
Good luck, Pinkie Pie.

249
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:35,192
How could she be so late to the
party? This isn't like her.

250
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:37,855
I'm sure she's trying her best.

251
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:40,247
Pinkie Pie's tougher
than she looks.

252
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:43,699
I know you're right,
but...I wish she was here.

253
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:47,813
I put too much pressure on
her. I let everypony down.

254
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:50,175
And Princess Celestia
will be here any minute

255
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:54,354
and see that I haven't made new
friends. I've made new enemies.

256
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,247
Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie!
I'm looking for Yakyakistan.

257
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,683
You know: faraway land, lots of
yaks. Maybe you've heard of it?

258
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:23,470
Whoa, slow down, I can't
understand a word you're saying.

259
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:33,020
There it is! Yakyakistan!

260
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:58,533
Noooooooo!

261
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:00,834
Is everypony all right?

262
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,470
I can't tell if my eyes
are opened or closed.

263
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,462
I think I can
see a little bit.

264
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:07,889
Nope.

265
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:16,316
Ooooooooh!

266
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,575
Look at these. Pinkie Pie's made
files for everypony in town.

267
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,676
With exactly what kind
of parties we like.

268
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:31,085
Pinkie Pie has a Secret Party
Planning Cave! How cool is this?

269
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:33,702
Twilight Sparkle likes
vanilla ice cream,

270
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,664
red balloons, dancing.

271
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:36,925
That's right.

272
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,462
But she's afraid
of quesadillas.

273
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,409
No I'm not!

274
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,685
They're just so

275
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:45,051
cheesy.

276
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,613
No! I'm all the way
back where I started!

277
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:59,318
Gummy, I was this close
to helping Twilight

278
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:00,255
befriend the yaks!

279
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:03,017
Now I've just let
everypony down.

280
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:12,266
Lookie here.
It's notes for the party

281
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:14,750
she wants to throw for her
folk's 50th anniversary.

282
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:16,438
But they ain't nearly that old.

283
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:19,520
Huh. She's already
plannin' their 100th, too.

284
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,386
And their 500th?

285
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,723
I had no idea she worked
so hard on her parties.

286
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,779
She may be more organized
than you, Twilight.

287
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,455
Let's not get carried away.

288
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,485
I just wish Pinkie Pie were here

289
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:34,434
so we could tell her how much we
all appreciate her hard work.

290
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:40,834
Thank you, thank you! I
love you too, all of you!

291
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:42,220
You're back!

292
00:18:42,777 --> 00:18:45,089
I tried to go to Yakyakistan so
I could bring something back

293
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:47,653
for my party but at the last
second I made a mistake.

294
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,916
I worked harder on this
party than any party ever,

295
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:54,971
but I'm still just
a big failure.

296
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:57,660
Pinkie Pie, you're
not a failure.

297
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:00,297
What matters is
how hard you tried.

298
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,864
Who else would've gone
all across Equestria

299
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,502
to plan one party?

300
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:08,255
You know, the trip
was really hard,

301
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:11,367
but everypony I met along
the way was so helpful.

302
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:14,518
I just wish the yaks could see
how friendly and wonderful

303
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,548
and great Equestria really is.

304
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:23,474
I JUST GOT THE BEST
PARTY IDEA EVER!

305
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,880
It's too late. The yaks
left on the last train.

306
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,066
Um, no they didn't.

307
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:33,424
Trust me, there are a whole
lot of sheep out there.

308
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:41,112
So, do we walk back
up the slide, or what?

309
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,994
YAKS STUCK HERE? WHY
TRAINS NOT WORK? GRRRR!

310
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:51,596
I never thought I'd say
this, but THANK YOU, SHEEP!

311
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,620
And now, if it's OK with
you, it's party time.

312
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:10,361
Wow, Pinkie, this came
together quick, even for you.

313
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:13,074
What can I say? I'm
good at what I do.

314
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,596
Prince Rutherford,
every time we tried

315
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:18,403
to make something in Equestria
feel like Yakyakistan,.

316
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,782
we couldn't get it right.

317
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,982
When I got back from my
adventure, I realized something.

318
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:25,920
We shouldn't try to make
Equestria feel like your home.

319
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:29,398
We should try to make you
feel at home in Equestria.

320
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:32,822
And that means showing
you why we love it here,

321
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,693
so you'll love it too.

322
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:44,826
Pink pony work hard to make yaks
feel at home. Now yaks happy.

323
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:46,986
No declare war.

324
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:54,300
Ponies and yaks. Friends?

325
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,060
For a thousand moons?

326
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,308
For a thousand MOONS!

327
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,662
I am very impressed, Princess.

328
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:08,407
Ha hah. Just doing my
best to spread friendship.

329
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:14,171
And you did a wonderful job
of it. You and your friends.

330
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:17,904
Pink Pony? You
understand yaks now.

331
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,586
Aw, come here, you.

332
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,542
Wow, too strong. OK! OK! OK!
