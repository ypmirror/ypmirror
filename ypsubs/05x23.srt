1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,360
Does every animal have their
copy of "Wuthering Hooves"?

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,070
Hooray! I love Furry
Friends Book Club.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,700
Now let's discuss
the theme of nature

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,380
as it applies to
Hoofcliff's love--

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,740
Did somepony leave a light on?

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,520
Oh, It's me.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,640
OH! It's me!

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,480
We'll continue this
discussion when I get back!

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:01:00,660

10
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,960
You're here!

11
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,040
Isn't this exciting!

12
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,880
Oh, you were called
too! Thank goodness.

13
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,340
I feel so much better
going with a friend.

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,800
I was about to come and get
you but then I got distracted.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,020
Oh.

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,940
Ever since the
map called us,

17
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,480
I've been doing a
ton of research.

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,100
Testing out potential
friendship problems,

19
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,360
diversifying my
solution portfolio...

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,270
"Ever since the map called us"?

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,580
But that happened
five minutes ago.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,880
I know, but I want to be one
hundred percent prepared.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,880
I mean, I'm the
Princess of Friendship.

24
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,080
How would it look if I couldn't
solve a friendship problem?

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,300
Oh, I'm so lucky I'm
being sent with you.

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,860
Speaking of which,
where are we going?

27
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,860
The Smokey Mountains!

28
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh, I've never
been there before.

29
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,560
Neither have I. And there isn't
a lot of information on them.

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,130
All I could find was this.

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,080
"The Smokey Mountains harbor
the most beautiful valley

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,660
in all of Equestria between its
two majestic mountain peaks."

33
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,700
That's gorgeous.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,450
And where there's nature,
there's a ton of animal friends!

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,320
I can't wait to
get started.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,540
I'm a little nervous, since
that's all I could find.

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I usually like to be
a bit more prepared.

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,020
You seem pretty
prepared to me.

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,460
Are those...for us?

40
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,930
Yup! I've prepared our things:
Snacks, books, blankets, books.

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,370
You said books twice.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,480
There are a lot of books.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,310
Oof!

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,720
What do you think our friendship
problem's going to be?

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,720
I don't know.
But I'm sure we'll figure it out.

46
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,100
Do you think it'll be
a problem about lying?

47
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,920
I'm sure we'll find
out when we get there.

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,140
You're right.

49
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,860
Ooh! Could it be about when two
friends just randomly decide

50
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,760
to do something together
but they forget to invite

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
the third friend and the
third friend feels left out?

52
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,300
Or where one friend tells
another friend's secret

53
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,680
after they ask them not to?

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,650
We'll know very, very soon,
since we're almost there.

55
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,860
Here, let me get that.

56
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,990
Oh, thank you.

57
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,260
Sorry I've been a little
scidilly-bopty-boo.

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,040
I just can't believe this
is finally happening!

59
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,480
Whoa!

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
What in
Equestria is happening?

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,040
It's nothing like your
book said it would be.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,360
Oh, boy, I'm feeling
very unprepared.

63
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,020
Where do we even start?

64
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,360
Maybe by figuring out where the
flying pumpkins are coming from?

65
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,620
Ready?

66
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,780
Aim.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,480
Fire!

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,760
Um, hi, hello. Excuse us,
but... what are you doing?

69
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
We're pumpkining our neighbors!

70
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,740
Yes. But, umm, why are you
pumpkining your neighbors?

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,360
Well, because the McColts
are just plain rotten.

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,200
Hey, wait a tick.
Who are you two?

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,060
You're not spies for
the McColts are ya?

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,900
I am Twilight Sparkle, the
Princess of Friendship.

75
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,280
And I am here to solve
your friendship problem.

76
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,920
I'm Fluttershy. And
um, I'm here, too.

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,740
Ma Hooffield.

78
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,630
Pleased to meet you, but
you're wasting your time.

79
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,200
We don't have a
friendship problem;

80
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,360
we have a McColt problem.

81
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,780
And there's absolutely
no friendship there.

82
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,640
Well, maybe there could be if we
figure out what the McColts did

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,720
to make you so mad.

84
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,220
Oh, well they've
done so many things!

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,940
Why just today, they shot
pebbles at our farmhouse

86
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,900
and wrecked it!

87
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,520
See, we're not very
good at building

88
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,600
so all it took was a
little pebble. But still.

89
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,500
Oh, no!

90
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,920
I know what to do. We're
gonna talk with these McColts

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,380
and hear their
side of the story.

92
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,760
Once we have all the facts,

93
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,500
we can put an end to this,
using reason and rationale.

94
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,340
Good plan!

95
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,220
That's why she's the Princess.

96
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,380
In the meantime, could you
please call off the pumpkining?

97
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,900
Oh, all right.

98
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,500
Thanks. Come on, Fluttershy.

99
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,020
State your business.

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,440
Don't even bother.

101
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,100
They're probably spies
for the Hooffields.

102
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,480
Hey wait, you're an Alicorn.

103
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,140
I thought just the three
princesses were Alicorns.

104
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,690
There are four Alicorn
princesses in Equestria now.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,460
I am Twilight Sparkle, The
Princess of Friendship!

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
And I'm Fluttershy.

107
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,180
We have a new princess?
When did that happen?

108
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,630
And, and how did the Hooffields
come by a princess spy?

109
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,500
We are not spies! Why does
everypony assume we're spies?

110
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,850
Because we don't get a lot of
visitors. I'm Big Daddy McColt.

111
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,040
You caught us at a weird time.

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,780
We're in the middle
of a giant feud

113
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,420
with our terrible neighbors!

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,690
Well, actually,
that's why we're here.

115
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,240
To solve your problem
with the Hooffields.

116
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,800
So you're here to help
us get rid of them?

117
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,540
No, that's not what
I meant at all!

118
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,810
Well, if you ain't for
us, you're against us.

119
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,940
<i> We are not</i>
<i> on anypony's side.</i>

120
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,180
We're here to help you
become friends again.

121
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,400
Well, that's gonna be hard.

122
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,300
I don't believe we've ever been
friends with the Hooffields.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,880
But you could be.

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,380
They're just really upset
you ruined their farmhouse--

125
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,780
Wait a hog-wogglin'
minute! We only did that

126
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,640
because the Hooffields pulled
the pin out of our wagon wheel.

127
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
A whole week's worth of food
rollin' down the mountain!

128
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,720
Us McColts are
mighty fine builders

129
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,500
but we don't know the
first thing about farming.

130
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,580
We have to travel a ways
away to buy our food.

131
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,580
And now, we'll be stuck
eating the pumpkins

132
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,740
the Hooffields launched at us!

133
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,240
Pumpkin bread, pumpkin
soup, pumpkin quesadillas,

134
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,720
pumpkin paella, pumpkin cheese,
pumpkin pie, pumpkin fri-ta-tas.

135
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,380
Actually that all sounds
pretty good, but it'll get old.

136
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,060
Have you tried meeting
at a neutral location,

137
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,580
talking about your problems, and
really listening to each other?

138
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,220
What? No. They'd sooner
launch their dinners at us

139
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,200
than listen to us.

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,660
Well, they'll listen to me.
I'm an impartial third party.

141
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,320
Attention,
Hooffields and McColts!

142
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm not on anypony's side, but I
can see you're both wasting time

143
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,320
and resources on being
mean to each other.

144
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,200
Ponies are supposed to help
each other and be kind.

145
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,700
So, let's stop this
senseless fighting.

146
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,140
There. That should do it.
Ready to go home, Fluttershy?

147
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,040
I'd love to, but if we've
solved the problem already,

148
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,460
shouldn't our cutie
marks be glowing again?

149
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,560
Oh, yeah. They should be
glowing any minute now.

150
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,540
Or not.

151
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,880
So much for potential friendship
solution number twenty-eight.

152
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,800
I guess we should find
out why the Hooffields

153
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,160
are launching tomatoes now.

154
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,870
One at a time, Greenhoof.

155
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,940
If you smush them
tomaters in the slingshot,

156
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,720
they won't break on the McColts!

157
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,780
What are you doing? I
asked you to stop fighting!

158
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Oh, is that what you
were hollerin' about?

159
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,140
We thought the McColts
rubbed you the wrong way,

160
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,980
so we tomatered them
for ya. My mistake.

161
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,100
Stop the tomater slingshots!

162
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,120
Reload the tomater slingshots!

163
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,500
We're gonna paint
their mountaintop red!

164
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,370
Well, that didn't work.
I was so sure it would.

165
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,540
It was a good plan, but we
need to think of another one.

166
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,520
And soon.

167
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,920
This fight is really affecting
the animals around here.

168
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,400
Not to worry. I'll just...find
the root of the problem

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,640
and work from there!

170
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,300
Pardon us, Ma, but do you
remember what started

171
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,880
this whole feud in
the first place?

172
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,460
They know what they did.

173
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,300
They know what they did.

174
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,820
I'm starting to think
neither of you know

175
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,060
what either of you have done.

176
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,680
Sure we do. Them Hooffields
did us a grave injustice

177
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,890
some time ago for some reason.

178
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,640
Hear, hear!

179
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,420
O-kay, backup plan
to the backup plan.

180
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,520
Maybe we can find some common
ground that you can bond over.

181
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,740
What do you do when
you're not fighting?

182
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,880
That's easy. Getting
ready to fight.

183
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,980
What do you hope to
get out of fighting?

184
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,710
The satisfaction of winning.

185
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,440
Of winning what?

186
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,700
The fight, of course. To
prove our family is the best!

187
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,260
The best at what?

188
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,190
Winning! Haven't
you been listenin'?

189
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,420
So the only thing they have in
common is that they both want

190
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,680
to win a fight and neither
of them know what it's over.

191
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,260
How can I end this feud if I
don't know what it's about?

192
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,160
Ooh. Maybe somepony just
needs to say they're sorry.

193
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,110
That's a good idea.

194
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,520
And friendship solution
#48, but we can move it up.

195
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,180
I'm so glad you
agreed to do this!

196
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,560
This apology cake
will go a long way

197
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,250
to making amends
between you two.

198
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,520
Which part of my argument
changed your mind?

199
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,580
The part where I said the
benefits of friendship

200
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,960
outweigh the cost of war?
Or the part where I said

201
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,090
forgiveness is an
investment in happiness?

202
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,540
Yeah, yeah, all of it.

203
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,200
Wait, are you even
listening to me?

204
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,230
Who goes there?

205
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,230
It's Ma Hooffield--

206
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,160
Hooffield alert! Arm the canons!

207
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,980
--with an apology cake.

208
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,760
Did you say...cake? As in, cake?

209
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,960
Consider it a gesture of
good will, from us to you.

210
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,260
I haven't had cake in ages.

211
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,830
Open the gates!

212
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,500
It's such a beautiful cake.

213
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,400
Think of this as more
than just a cake.

214
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,240
It's the first step in the
long road to forgiveness.

215
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,260
Nothing says let's be friends
like a cake that says

216
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,600
"let's be friends".

217
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,820
I wrote that in
icing on the top.

218
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,150
For glory!

219
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,800
McColts! Assume delta
force formation!

220
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,940
Ready?

221
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,380
Aim!

222
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,020
Fire!

223
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,480
Ma Hooffield! You planted
ponies in that cake?

224
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,900
Yeah. Wait, were you
serious about apologizing?

225
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,700
Why in Equestria
would we do that?

226
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,940
We didn't do anything wrong!

227
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,540
What are you talkin' about?

228
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,130
You've done so
many things wrong!

229
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,970
Not as many as you!

230
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,040
If you could just
not yell so much,

231
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,640
or maybe stop saying
words altogether...

232
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,010
Agh!

233
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,080
Twilight?

234
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,660
Um, Twilight? We should
probably get back there.

235
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,880
I mean, if you need
a break, that's fine

236
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,460
but I really can't
do this without you.

237
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,970
I don't know if we
can do this at all.

238
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,600
Even if I make things right,

239
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,440
they're just going
to fight again.

240
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,640
Hey, little fellas. That's
OK. You can come out.

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,090
What was that?

242
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,200
Oh, you poor things! There
isn't enough food here for you.

243
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,640
Brr! And you're freezing! I'm
gonna take you all home with me

244
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,070
and get you all hot cocoas. How
do you feel about book clubs?

245
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,280
I don't get it.

246
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,440
This was supposed to be
the most beautiful valley

247
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,000
in all of Equestria.
What happened?

248
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,480
What's that?

249
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,720
Oh.

250
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,960
Uh huh.

251
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,050
Twilight! They know what
happened here!

252
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,480
What?

253
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,880
Stop! You have to listen to me!

254
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,560
EVERYPONY FREEZE!

255
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,360
Fluttershy, you
have to tell them!

256
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,160
It's a lot harder to
freeze an army of ponies

257
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
than just six of them.

258
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,600
Before you keep fighting, there
is something you should know.

259
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,190
Long ago, there were
two best friends...

260
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,760
...Grub Hooffield
and Piles McColt.

261
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,330
When they found the valley
between the Smokey Mountains,

262
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,560
they knew it was
something special.

263
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,760
So they made a promise to each
other to protect and preserve

264
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,920
the valley for all its
adorable furry inhabitants.

265
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,200
But, they disagreed
on how to go about it.

266
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,880
Grub wanted to start
by planting crops

267
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,200
so that everypony would
have something to eat.

268
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
But Piles thought it
would be better to start

269
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,200
by building a shelter to protect
them against the cold and wind.

270
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,220
The two ponies were unable
to come to an understanding.

271
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,960
So Piles went ahead and
built a shelter anyway,

272
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,560
exactly where Grub was
going to start his farm.

273
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,440
Grub was upset, so he
tore down Piles' shelter

274
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,920
so he could plant his crops.

275
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,760
They kept fighting,
back and forth,

276
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,720
until it turned into a feud.

277
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,830
The valley suffered from
the constant destruction

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,880
until finally the
Hooffields and McColts moved

279
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,360
to separate mountains.

280
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,310
Even then, the valley and
all the animals in it

281
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,200
continued to be caught
in the crossfire.

282
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,520
You see, by fighting, you're
destroying the very thing

283
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
that brought you here
in the first place.

284
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,600
So it's time you both put
your differences aside

285
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,840
and come together, if
not for yourselves,

286
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,360
then for the sake of these
cute and cuddly guys.

287
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,300
Aw, shucks. We never meant
to hurt you little critters.

288
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,680
Yeah, we're sorry.

289
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,210
They say they
accept your apology!

290
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,840
Um, Princess? You
can unfreeze us now.

291
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,040
Oh, right.

292
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,690
Ma Hooffield? We promise we
won't fight you no more.

293
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,160
Us too. Except we
promise not to fight you.

294
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,640
I suppose it doesn't matter
who's right. We're both wrong.

295
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,360
That's one thing
we can agree on.

296
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,510
This is wonderful!

297
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,960
I am so proud of you two.

298
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,360
Thanks, Princess.

299
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,400
Though I would just
like to point out

300
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,560
that I was the first
to admit I was wrong.

301
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,230
That may be, but I promised
not to fight first.

302
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,500
That counts for more.

303
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,040
Oh, yeah?

304
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,360
Oh, all right. We don't
have to speak animal

305
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,040
to know what y'all
are sayin'. Truce?

306
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,380
Truce.

307
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,120
Hoo-wee, ain't that
a pretty sight!

308
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
Sure is.

309
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,560
The McColts are going to
help us rebuild our homes --

310
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,240
good ones this time.

311
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,800
And the Hooffields are going
to help us grow some crops.

312
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,200
Not pumpkins!

313
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,310
Thanks for teaching us that
friendship is so much better

314
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,580
than winning a silly argument.

315
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,240
Yay! I told you
we'd figure it out.

316
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,040
We did. And we didn't need my
friendship portfolio to do it.

317
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,000
We just needed each other.

318
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,400
So what do you think
will happen next?

319
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
We've all been called
by the map now.

320
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,080
I'm sure we'll find
out when we get home.

321
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,810
What if it summons all six
of us to another place?

322
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,320
Or another pony we
weren't expecting?

323
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,600
What if it wants us to solve
other kinds of problems like

324
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
quantum physics or why the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree?
