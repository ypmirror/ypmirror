1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,100
Today we have two
special guests

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,090
with a very special
announcement.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,680
Everypony, welcome the Head
of the Equestria Games,

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,380
Ms. Harshwhinny.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,930
Thank you.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,410
Now I'm sure you all
know about the Equestria Games,

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,910
where ponies from all over
the land compete for glory

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,100
in various athletic pursuits?

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,380
Well, now you littlest ones will
have the chance to compete

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,330
for a weighty responsibility
of your very own.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,090
<i>Oh, c'mon! Tell them</i>
<i>the fun part!</i>

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,160
That's right!

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,780
All you gotta do is show
Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest,

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,400
most spectacular,
most rockin' routine

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,270
and you're goin' to
the Games!

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,020
So, who's gonna be
the lucky ponies?

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,970
It's got to be me.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,530
Maybe it's me.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,330
Maybe it's us!

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,300
<i>Maybe it's us!</i>

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,170
Hey! It could happen!

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,240

23
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,560
<i>So the winning team</i>
<i>gets to carry</i>

24
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,240
<i>the Ponyville flag at</i>
<i>the Equestria Games!</i>

25
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,080
Oh, you are gonna LOVE this!

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,110
<i>Miss Dash!</i>

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,330
Will you please curb
your overenthusiastic outbursts!

28
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,020
Now then, let me be
clear on the rules.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,770
You ponies will form teams.

30
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,160
<i>Each team will create</i>
<i>their own flag-carrying routine.</i>

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,120
<i>Everypony will be judged on</i>
<i>grace, style, and originality.</i>

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,480
There's a most complicated
scoring system,

33
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,760
which I will elaborate
upon now. Firstly...

34
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,770
Aw, Get to the
nitty gritty later.

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,110
Tell them the important
stuff: like who's the coach?

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,750
That's right: ME!

37
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,450
And you know why I'm
qualified to coach you?

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,640
Guess who carried the
Cloudsdale flag in the Games

39
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,240
when she was a little filly.

40
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,300
ME!

41
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,220
I'll never forget it.

42
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,320
I burst into the stadium...

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,960
spreading my wings,
the flag flapping in the breeze!

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,670
<i>I did tricks with that</i>
<i>flag the likes of which</i>

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,760
<i>no pony saw before,</i>
<i>and no pony's seen since!</i>

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,950
Professionalism, Ms. Dash,
I must insist.

47
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,910
If you want to keep your job
as coach of these ponies,

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,700
you must maintain a
professional attitude

49
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,730
and keep your
emotions in check!

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,120
Am I making myself absolutely,
100% crystal clear?

51
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,320
Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny.

52
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,050
You know, professionalism
is my middle name.

53
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,460
Rainbow
"Professionalism" Dash.

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,360
Hmph! Well, in
three days' time,

55
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,000
Ms. Dash will accompany anypony
competing to the Crystal Empire

56
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,320
where you will demonstrate
your routines for me

57
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,920
and the other judges.

58
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,510
Who will judge you
very professionally.

59
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,690
Ahem! Yes, quite,
quite correct!

60
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,100
In the meantime, get
ready to train and train hard!

61
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,610
Because I know this Opening
Ceremony is the single most

62
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,940
<i>important thing that will ever</i>
<i>happen in your young lives.</i>

63
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,690
But I know you're up
for the challenge!

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,090
And so am I!

65
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,620
WA-WAHOOOO

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,890
AHEM!

67
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,160
Meet me after school tomorrow
at 1500 hours, sharp.

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,780
And show me
your flag-carrying skills.

69
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,220
I am outta here!

70
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,000
Professionally!

71
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,600
See how professionally?

72
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,080
Ponies, the most
important thing is this:

73
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,140
<i>your routine needs to show</i>
<i>what your town means to you.</i>

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,010
<i>So do Ponyville proud!</i>

75
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,660
Work hard. Be bold. Wow me.

76
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,540
That is all.

77
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,260
So what do you say we come
up with the perfect routine

78
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,360
and win this thing?

79
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,580
I'd say that's rootin'
tootin' terrific!

80
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,150
<i>But there's one problem!</i>

81
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,780
I bet everypony in class
is planning to compete.

82
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,630
Listen, somepony in our class
is gonna carry that flag.

83
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,290
So it might as well be us!

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,820
Crusaders, are you in,
or are you in?

85
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,070
Cause I'M in.

86
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,240
Me too!

87
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,030
Me three!

88
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,420
All right, the winning
routine needs to show

89
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,390
what's important about
Ponyville, right?

90
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,180
Right!

91
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,220
So what's special
about Ponyville?

92
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,620
It's...It's...

93
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,730
I've got it!

94
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,770
It's a place where
different kinds of ponies

95
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,350
live together as friends.

96
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,090
Earth Ponies, like me!

97
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,690
Unicorns, like me!

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,990
And Pegasi, like me!

99
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,830
So somehow we gotta figure out
a way to show that in our act.

100
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,550
We're gonna
need a plan.

101
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,220
And a lotta
hard work.

102
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,640
And a whole bunch
of practice.

103
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,730
But take it from me: We
may just be little ponies,

104
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,860
but we have hearts as
strong as horses!

Whoa!

133
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:41,620
Oof!

134
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,800
If that's the best you've got,
we're going to win for sure!

135
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,370
We already have the most
divine routine planned.

136
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,870
It's absolutely
sure to crush everyone else.

137
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,520
And I mean CRUSH!

138
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,920
But we're winners,
and we have heaaaarts...

139
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,060
Sure, but you know
what you don't have?

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,900
<i>YOUR CUTIE MARKS!</i>

141
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,900
Blank Flanks! Blank Flanks!
Blank Flanks!

142
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,000
What does that have to
do with flag-carrying?

143
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,050
Having Cutie-Mark-less
ponies represent Ponyville

144
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,000
would be unthinkable!

145
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,170
And we, of course,
already HAVE our Cutie Marks.

146
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,940
So we know who's going
to be in the winner's circle.

147
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,790
Listen you two: Cutie Marks or
no Cutie Marks, you'll see:

148
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,900
the Crusaders are going to
carry that flag at the Games.

149
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,470
May the best ponies win!

150
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,540
GAME ON!

151
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,300
Show me what you got, Cutie Mark
Crusaders. And make it good.

152
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,940
Don't worry, we will!

153
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,840
<i>Now, this is just a</i>
<i>little something</i>

154
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,740
we threw together.

155
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,550
<i>It's not perfect</i>
<i>yet. Not even close.</i>

156
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,900
Let's watch the Cutie
Mark GOOF-saders

157
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,790
do their sad
little routine.

158
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,880
They're gonna be
a hot mess.

159
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,760
<i>Since the dawn of recorded time,</i>

160
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,360
<i>in one town of amazing</i>
<i>amazingness...</i>

161
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,630
three types of
ponies coexist.

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,730
We are Earth Ponies...

163
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,700
We are Unicorns...

164
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,640
We are Pegasi!

165
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,510
<i>And the town where friendship</i>
<i>reigns is our home.</i>

166
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,280
<i>Now welcome to the stadium</i>

167
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,890
<i>the flag of the place</i>
<i>we love best...</i>

168
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,790
<i>PONYVILLE FOREVER!</i>

169
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,540
<i>YAY!</i>

170
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,080
It's kind of a
work in progress.

171
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,690
So, what did you think?

172
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,410
That.

173
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,170
Was.

174
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,200
AMA...

175
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,640
Wait. Hold on now.

176
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,570
<i>Gotta stay calm,</i>
<i>cool, and collected.</i>

177
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,540
To give a calm,
clear analysis...

178
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,820
Wait! You whipped that
act together just yesterday?

179
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,600
That...

180
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,250
is...

181
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,970
<i>Professionalism, Dash.</i>

182
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,950
<i>Keep those emotions in check.</i>

183
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,000
Overall it was kinda sorta...

184
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,770
Overall it was OK.

185
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,100
Keep working hard,
who knows?

186
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,380
You might have a
shot. Gotta go.

187
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,730
Do y'all think she liked it?

188
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,060
I'm not really sure.

189
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,420
You heard her. If we
keep working hard,

190
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,340
we might have a shot.

191
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,470
So let's keep working!

192
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,790
Trot to it, ponies!

193
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,750
Did you SEE that?

194
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,100
I can't believe I'm saying
this. They could win!

195
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,670
But how do we stop them?

196
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,870
We already called
them Blank Flanks.

197
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,020
Then we need to find a new
way to get under their skin.

198
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,410
Or maybe, get under their WINGS.

199
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,990
Girls, we just wanted to say
your act is quite impressive!

200
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,470
Wait, what?

201
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,570
Um... thanks?

202
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,870
Oh, but of course!

203
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,290
As a matter of fact,
we think you're very brave.

204
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,350
Brave? Why?

205
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,300
Isn't it obvious?

206
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,300
It is to us.

207
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,380
In fact, it's obvious
to everypony.

208
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,660
You're showing all three
types of Ponyville ponies,

209
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,640
yet you have a
Pegasus Pony...

210
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,010
who can't even fly!

211
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,860
What in tarnation does that
have to do with anything?

212
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,800
I'd say
not being able to fly

213
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,580
has everything to do with
everything, doesn't it?

214
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,810
I mean, a Pegasus
pony at your age?

215
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,460
You should have been
flying long ago!

216
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,220
So what if my wings
can't get me off the ground?

217
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,100
Your career as a
flag carrier

218
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,330
isn't getting off
the ground, either.

219
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,320
Ms. Harshwhinny will
never pick a Pegasus pony

220
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,530
who can't fly to
represent Ponyville

221
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,900
in front of all
of Equestria!

222
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,700
Ms. Harshwinny never
said anything about that!

223
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,790
I would've thought
that was obvious.

224
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,990
<i>Well, have fun</i>
<i>practicing anyway.</i>

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,230
Even if your routine
will never...how shall I say?

226
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,870
"Take off."

227
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,730
Don't listen to them, Scootaloo.

228
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,800
Scootaloo?

229
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,900
You OK?

230
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,290
This routine isn't
working how it is.

231
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,460
We've gotta rethink
my part in the whole thing.

232
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,390
WHAT?

233
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,090
Why?

234
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,200
If we want to win, I'm
gonna have to fly.

235
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,560
Is that even possible?

236
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,780
And by tomorrow?

237
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,370
Maybe I can fly if I
work twice as hard.

238
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,200
See?

239
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,430
Oof!

240
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,990
Maybe three times as hard.

241
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,830
<i>Golly, I don't know,</i>
<i>Scootaloo.</i>

242
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,580
I don't think
that's the problem.

243
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,280
Well, I know
this for sure,

244
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,280
flying is the only
way we're gonna win.

245
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,980
So it's back to practice!

246
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,070
Is this a good idea?

247
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,640
<i>Whooah!</i>

248
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,050
I'll just work four
times as hard.

249
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,550
Probably not.

250
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,010
Guys, guys, guys!
Try it again.

251
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,210
We've been rehearsing
all the livelong day!

252
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,850
We're getting tired.

253
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,140
Fine. We'll skip to my big
impressive flying entrance.

254
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,130
So you've done the do-si-do
to the left, then the right,

255
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,290
and there's the hoop.

256
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,580
Then I come in...

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,760
Not quite what I had in mind.

258
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,660
We'll just try that
part again.

259
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,700
I liked our routine
the way it was!

260
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,210
Me too. But all she cares
about now is flying.

261
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,610
Don't worry; I'll be
flyin' high tomorrow

262
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,880
at our final run-through
for Rainbow Dash.

263
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,880
I'm gonna get this, you'll see!

264
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,530
Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders,
this is your final run

265
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,410
before you show it at the
stadium tomorrow.

266
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,260
I know you're gonna
absolutely, positively,

267
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,890
...have a lot of fun.

268
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,760
OK, go!

269
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,800
Ponyville!

270
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,370
home of the um...

271
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,740
Friendship!

272
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,110
Friendship, right!

273
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,810
There are four--no, three
kinds of ponies...

274
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,680
Left! LEFT!

275
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,920
I'm sorry!

276
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,350
I'm just tired.

277
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,090
And then I dip, and
then we turn...

278
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,620
Sorry!

279
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,690
<i>Tada! </i>

280
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,860
So? What'd you think?

281
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,170
That's. Y'know. Good and
all, heh heh.

282
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,100
I just thought maybe
possibly you might wanna

283
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,000
go back to, say, the first
version of the act, which was,

284
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,810
I don't know, what's the word?

285
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,910
Better.

286
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,310
<i>Just do the routine</i>
<i>as it was.</i>

287
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,680
Don't mess with
success, right?

288
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,680
Seriously.

289
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,320
Now I need to go coach
these other ponies.

290
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,640
And don't forget we've gotta
catch the early train

291
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,820
for the Crystal Empire.

292
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,320
<i>See you in the morning!</i>

293
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,790
What are we gonna do?

294
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,160
We're competing tomorrow
and I still can't fly, unless...

295
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm just too tired.
I can't keep going.

296
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,180
Me too!

297
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,040
I'm tired; I'm hungry. And
now I hate this routine!

298
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,170
It feels like it's
all about you now.

299
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,570
<i>She's right.</i>

300
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,410
It's like you don't
even need us anymore.

301
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,310
Of course I need you!

302
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,720
Without you two, who's
going to hold up the hoop?

303
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,150
UGH! You don't
listen to yourself!

304
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,620
Oh, forget it.

305
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,190
<i>I'm going home to</i>
<i>get some sleep.</i>

306
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,890
So? Are you gonna
leave me too?

307
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,690
We've gotta catch the early
train to the Crystal Empire.

308
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,430
I better get some rest.

309
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,400
See you in the
morning, Scootaloo.

310
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,170
Come on, Scootaloo!

311
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,830
Do it for Ponyville.

312
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,400
Just gotta try 20
times as hard.

313
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,240
Thirty - times - as hard.

314
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,240
Oof!

315
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,970
Just a little harder...

316
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,250
I can't fly.

317
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,960
I just...
can't!

318
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,010
Crystal Empire!
All aboard!

319
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,260
Scootaloo?

320
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,170
Where IS she?

321
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,210
She better get here soon. This
here train is about to leave!

322
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,440
<i>Here I am.</i>

323
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,080
We were scared you were going
to miss the train.

324
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,810
I - I'm not going.

325
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,980
WHAT?

326
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,420
I'm the weak link.

327
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,420
If I go and fall, flop,
or do anything but fly,

328
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,220
I'm gonna blow it
for you two.

329
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,160
I can't believe you're
quitting on us!

330
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,310
But you're better
off without me!

331
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,290
But that's not
true, Scootaloo!

332
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,130
Ya know what, Sweetie
Belle? Forget it!

333
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,200
If she's gonna quit, we don't'
want her and we don't need her!

334
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,900
FINE!

335
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,840
Fine.

336
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,650
Fine.

337
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,030
<i>All aboard!</i>

338
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,250
How's my favorite
routine going today?

339
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,720
Oh, I just can't keep it in.

340
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,560
I want you to win so bad!

341
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,290
<i>"BumBUM, bumBUM". </i>

342
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,230
Then Scootaloo does
that KAPOW!

343
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,130
through the hoop!

344
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,170
Well, there ain't gonna be
a Scootaloo. She's staying home.

345
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,180
She's WHAT?

346
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,550
She got it in her head that the
only way to represent Ponyville

347
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,810
was by flying in our routine.

348
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,410
When she couldn't do it,
she told us she was quitting.

349
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,880
And then you tried to stop
her from doing that, right?

350
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,380
Well, actually we
kinda told her...

351
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,490
that we didn't
want a quitter.

352
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,660
Hang on! Are you NUTS?

353
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,890
You're a team and a team
never leaves a friend behind.

354
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,320
Come on!

355
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,530
Sorry you
can't make it!

356
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,350
We'll take a picture for
you from the winners' circle.

357
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,670
I do not like them one bit.

358
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,240
Put on some speed, girls!

359
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,220
<i>Throwing away</i>
<i>your scooter?</i>

360
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,690
Rainbow Dash?

361
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,560
Yup. But not just me.

362
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,930
I don't want to see them.

363
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,860
And what are they
doing here, anyway?

364
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,970
They're supposed to
be on the train.

365
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,500
We're not going.

366
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,300
Not without
YOU, Scootaloo.

367
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,340
What's gotten into
you, Scootaloo?

368
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,330
I didn't want to ruin
their chance to win

369
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,580
just because I couldn't fly.

370
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,510
And who said you had to?

371
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,920
But flying's what Pegasus
ponies are supposed to do!

372
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,320
YOU flew when you carried
the flag in the Games.

373
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,790
But that was me!

374
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,460
You are you!

375
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,360
And it just doesn't
matter if you can fly or not!

376
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,770
<i>Your routine was amazing</i>
<i>'cause it represented</i>

377
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,300
<i>exactly what makes</i>
<i>Ponyville special.</i>

378
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,000
You do still know
what that is, right?

379
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,220
Friendship.

380
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,300
Three kinds of ponies
living together as friends,

381
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,430
just like us!

382
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,470
Earth Ponies...

383
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,640
Unicorns...

384
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,880
And Pegasi.

385
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,380
But Rainbow Dash...

386
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,320
What if...what if my
wings never grow?

387
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,450
What if I never fly?

388
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,320
Listen, Scootaloo:
maybe you'll fly someday...

389
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,690
or maybe you won't.

390
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,960
You're all kinds of
awesome anyway.

391
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,930
