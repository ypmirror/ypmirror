172
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:54,233
[loud music and
rattling machines]

173
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,775
<i> NO! You are</i>
<i> ruining my show!</i>

174
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,375
It isn't just your show
and I'm improving it!

175
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,098
You don't pull a rabbit
out of a hat on a trapeze!

176
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,646
That's the point!
To give the audience

177
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:12,590
something they've never seen
before: acrobatic magic!

178
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:17,187
<i> ♪ TA DA. ♪</i>

179
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,098
It's called "blending
genres" and it's AWESOME!

180
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,246
Shouldn't somepony do something?

181
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:29,809
Ha! They've been doing this
since they started working here.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,775
Too bad, really. If they ever
stopped shouting at each other,

183
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:34,313
we could take the show on tour.

184
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:37,975
They'd be way more successful
than staying at Gladmane's.

185
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,723
Now, that sounds like a
real friendship problem!

186
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,750
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

187
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,372
<i> Stop! What are</i>
<i> you doing?</i>

188
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,141
It's supposed to be a
Pink Prairie Dog Pyramid.

189
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,335
It's alliterative!

190
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:58,744
You said a tower! Why do you
keep changing everything?!

191
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:02,775
I'm not changing anything.
You said pyramid!

192
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:08,689
ARGHHH! You are
driving me crazy!

193
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:12,400
I thought you
two got along.

194
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,649
We used to.

195
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:16,627
But we just can't seem to
agree on anything anymore.

196
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:20,375
We used to perform
all over Equestria,

197
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:22,024
but if we can't
agree on a new act,

198
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,615
we might as well stay
at Gladmane's forever.

199
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,295
[knock knock]

200
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:33,113
Two friendship problems in the
same theater? Now we're talking!

201
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,264
If you count Flim and Flam,

202
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:40,024
that's three big friendship
problems all in the same place.

203
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,969
Well, I don't
count Flim and Flam

204
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,523
since those two not being
friends isn't a problem.

205
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,406
It certainly isn't
for Gladmane.

206
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,701
It sounds like he's better
off with them fighting.

207
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:51,760
Actually, the other
ponies' problems

208
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,876
seem to be good
for Gladmane too.

209
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:57,476
Both the trapeze show and the
animal act would be better off

210
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:01,150
if they left, but everypony is
so busy arguing that they can't.

211
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,040
Do you think he knows?

212
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:06,935
I don't know. But I'm starting
to think we should find out.

213
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:11,396
Of course, Gladmane wants
everypony to get along!

214
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:15,421
He's the nicest, most
genuine pony I've ever met.

215
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,280
Did the director
put you up to this?

216
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:19,630
[whispering noises]

217
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,664
I tell you, if Gladmane
is your friend,

218
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:24,996
you are welcome backstage,

219
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:29,446
but if you are speaking
of him poorly, you leave!

220
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:34,123
Gladmane is the
kindest, most gentle...

221
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,347
...most compassionate
pony I've ever known.

222
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,264
My problem is with him!

223
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,261
I just can't figure it.

224
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,775
The only pony who benefits from
all this feudin' is Gladmane,

225
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,695
but by all accounts
he's the best friend

226
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:52,006
any of these
ponies have.

227
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,920
Well, Bernard, that adorable
bunny from the acrobat's hat,

228
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:59,415
claims that every morning,
Gladmane tells the director

229
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:01,366
that the star wants
control of the show.

230
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:03,458
And every afternoon
tells the star

231
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,415
that the director wants to get
rid of her. But neither is true.

232
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,661
And the Flying Prairinos,
the Pink Prairie Dog family,

233
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,747
say Gladmane keeps
changing their act

234
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:16,584
to make each trainer think
the other is doing it.

235
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,409
So, all his talk
about friendship

236
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,058
is just a load of
apple sauce.

237
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:23,581
He's gettin' them all to fight
with each other on purpose!

238
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,409
But how can we get everypony to
believe that's what he's doing?

239
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:30,732
There must be a way to trick
him into telling the truth.

240
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,230
Gee, if only
there was a pony

241
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:35,360
who knew how to
trick a trickster.

242
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:39,544
[shouted argument]

243
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,806
Or maybe, a pair
of ponies.

244
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:47,083
[sigh]. Fine. I guess bringing
Flim and Flam back together

245
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,298
might be why we're
here. Maybe.

246
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:57,593
Sorry if I don't take the word
of some pony off the street.

247
00:12:57,686 --> 00:13:00,713
Even if that street
is in Ponyville.

248
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:03,716
But Gladmane is behind so many
other friendship problems,

249
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:06,498
how can you be sure he
isn't the cause of yours?

250
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:10,904
Because the only problem I
have is standing right there.

251
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,966
Same here, buster.

252
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,686
Do either of you even know
what you're fighting over?

253
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,338
Gladmane let me know
that ex-brother of mine

254
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,667
thinks I'm just a mouthpiece
without a single good idea.

255
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,827
Gladmane assured me this
former, fraternal foal here

256
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,830
thinks I couldn't sell
heat lamps to yaks.

257
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,556
Sounds to me like neither
of you said those things.

258
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,024
Why'd you believe Gladmane
when he said you did?

259
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,483
Why would he lie?

260
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,049
Because he's afraid that
the two of you together

261
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,578
could move in and
take over his resort.

262
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:42,596
And if I'm telling
you he said it,

263
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:45,009
you know it's the
absolute truth because...

264
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,581
You never lie!

265
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:51,981
Oh, brother of mine, I think
it's time for a little payback.

266
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,298
The "Canterlot Two-step?"

267
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:56,830
We don't have the chickens. How
about the "Baltimare Flare"?

268
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,504
Uh, my flare isn't
what it used to be.

269
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,123
[Gladmane over loudspeaker]
Listen here, y'all.

270
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,086
If you're a friend of
mine, you're entitled

271
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,600
to a free night's stay.

272
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:07,218
And everypony here's a
friend of mine! Thank you.

273
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:08,689
Thank you very much.

274
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:10,387
Are you thinking
what I am?

275
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,910
The "High
Roller Hustle"!

276
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,732
The what now?

277
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:18,030
Trust us, when we're done,
there won't be a pony in town

278
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,061
who doesn't know the
Applejackiest truth

279
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:21,040
about Gladmane.

280
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:24,313
That is, assuming you
two are willing to help.

281
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,153
What size gown
do you wear?

282
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,470
[excited murmurs]

283
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,218
What's all the fuss, now?

284
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,661
It's the grand-matriarch of the
Rich family, Impossibly Rich.

285
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:40,529
She's one of the wealthiest
ponies in Equestria.

286
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,236
Well, why didn't
somepony tell me?

287
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,581
You know how I like to give
VIP guests my personal touch.

288
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,944
Well, she's not
exactly a guest.

289
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,818
Word is she's planning
a resort of her own.

290
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,461
I think she's here to
scout the competition.

291
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,713
Oh, really?

292
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:02,141
And with her bits, she could
take over the whole strip,

293
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:04,553
hire away anypony
she wants.

294
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,901
[snarl]

295
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:08,073
Not me, of course.
I love it here.

296
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,436
My good-for-nothing
brother on the other hoof.

297
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:16,036
Pfft. Impossibly Rich! What
an honor it is to have you

298
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,430
at my humble
five-hoof resort!

299
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:21,015
I'm sure Flam has
done an excellent job

300
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,236
showing you around,
but nothing could beat

301
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:27,316
a personalized tour from The
Mane himself! Ah-huh-huh?

302
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,347
[whispering]

303
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:32,843
You'll have to excuse Ms.
Rich, she saves the energy

304
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,095
other ponies spend talking
out loud and uses it

305
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,720
to make more money.

306
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,920
[whispers]

307
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:42,627
She'd love a personal tour,
say, in uh, about an hour?

308
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,193
Well, that sounds
right pleasant.

309
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,018
And if you can break
away for a moment, Flam,

310
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:51,649
I'd love to see you in my
office so I can get ready.

311
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,892
Are all of you sure
this is a good idea?

312
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,338
Abso-tively!

313
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:03,673
Gladmane is one fish
that's hooked but good.

314
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,704
I sure hope you two
know what you're doing.

315
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,458
Oh don't you worry.

316
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:10,326
When it comes to throwing
ponies off their game...

317
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:12,473
...no two ponies do
it better than us.

318
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:14,701
I can't argue with that.

319
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,600
Hey there boss, Impossibly
Rich is just about ready

320
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:24,516
for that tour. So what did
you wanna see me about?

321
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:27,643
Actually, there's something
I want you to see.

322
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:32,769
The grand plan: Every hotel on
the strip as amazin' as this one

323
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,200
and every one of them mine.

324
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:36,067
[admiring whistle]

325
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:40,609
And all it'll take is a little
salesponyship. Like this.

326
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:43,323
Hey there, friends, ah-huh-huh!

327
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,895
If you think my
resort is fantastic,

328
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:49,267
wait till you see
Poné Fantastique.

329
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:53,138
Tickets are on sale now.
Two for the price of one.

330
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:55,495
Thank you. Thank
you very much.

331
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,455
Now I know Impossibly
Rich has probably

332
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:00,978
made you a tempting offer
to come work for her.

333
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,006
Well, now that
you mention it...

334
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,286
And as your friend, I'd
never tell you what to do,

335
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,061
but no pony is gonna stand
in the way of my plans,

336
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,550
no matter how rich she is.

337
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:14,916
And I sure wouldn't want you
to end up on the losing side.

338
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:17,243
Think you might
consider staying here?

339
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,320
Yeah.

340
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,289
Well, all right, then.

341
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:25,304
They're coming!

342
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:31,126
And last, but not least, Ms.
Rich, the jewel in my crown.

343
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:33,692
[whispers]

344
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,947
Impossibly wants you to
know she's very impressed.

345
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,861
But doesn't think
you can keep a resort

346
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,830
of this calibre
going for long.

347
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,843
Oh, and why is that?

348
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,984
[whispers]

349
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,710
Because you've got the best
talent in the industry.

350
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:52,043
What stops them from just
leaving to join any competitor?

351
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,464
[laugh] Well, you see,
I have a trick for that,

352
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:57,126
I must confess, ah-huh-huh.

353
00:17:57,372 --> 00:18:01,421
And it all has to do with
how I handle my employees.

354
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,027
And how is that?

355
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:07,323
Well... LIKE FRIENDS, of course!

356
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:10,080
And I treat every
one of my employees

357
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,387
with the kindness
they deserve!

358
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:15,593
Oh. That's it?
THAT'S your secret?

359
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,793
There's nothing else?

360
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:21,310
Nope. Just friendship.

361
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:23,975
But you know all about
friendship, don't you...

362
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,418
FLUTTERSHY?

363
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,040
You knew the whole time?

364
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,501
Never try to con a con-pony!
Uh-huh-huh! [mocking laughter]

365
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:42,615
I'd have thought you'd
hit the road by now.

366
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,886
Whether we were able
to fool you or not,

367
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,704
you can't just go on keeping
ponies from getting along.

368
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:49,815
It's just mean!

369
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,520
Now maybe it is, but it's
a meanness that works,

370
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:56,350
unlike your pathetic
little ploy.

371
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,332
I practically invented
the "High Roller Hustle."

372
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,978
But I suppose I
should be impressed.

373
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,575
You're the only ponies to
ever figure out the secret

374
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:06,529
to my success.

375
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:09,476
It takes a lot of work
keepin' everypony fightin',

376
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:12,830
but as long as I keep 'em
convinced I'm their only friend,

377
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,920
all of Las Pegasus will be mine.

378
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:19,532
Oh, you can't trick a confession
out of a pony like me.

379
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,233
I am always one step ahead.

380
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,824
Well, you better
check your hooves.

381
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:27,556
Because... you've just
stepped in a confession.

382
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:31,544
Oh no. Oh no. Wait, wait.

383
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,341
Did that sound OK?

384
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,723
Never better!

385
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:38,375
Flim and Flam told us
you'd see right through

386
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,953
the fake rich pony bit.
And that once you did,

387
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:43,378
you wouldn't be able to
resist gloating about it.

388
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,396
This was all part of the plan.

389
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:50,104
Oh now, now friends! Listen
I can explain everything!

390
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,732
I think you've done
enough of that.

391
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,815
Darling?

392
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:59,409
Oh! I cannot believe we let him
almost ruin our friendship.

393
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:02,978
And our act. Good luck
finding another one.

394
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,510
Wait! No! Y'all COME BACK!
C'mon I'm gonna be ruined!

395
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:12,572
This is Gladmane, y'all!
C'mon you can't do this!

396
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,135
Gladmane has left
the building!

397
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
[crash]

398
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:22,750
I guess the map wasn't
on the fritz after all.

399
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,033
If it weren't for your
history with Flim and Flam,

400
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,520
you never would have be
so determined to find

401
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,676
somepony else to help

402
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:33,403
and we never would have found
out what Gladmane was doing.

403
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:35,784
And if it weren't for you
wanting to show even those

404
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:37,409
two con ponies kindness,

405
00:20:37,507 --> 00:20:40,018
we never would have been
able to trick the trickster.

406
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,756
It must've felt pretty
nice to finally put

407
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,790
all your connivin' and
cheatin' skills to good use.

408
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,086
In fact, we like to think of it

409
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:50,603
as a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

410
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,578
Emphasis on the "once."

411
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,335
What do you mean?

412
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:59,680
While this establishment
undergoes a slight change

413
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:02,707
in management, my brother
and I want to assure you

414
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:05,969
that it remains the pinnacle
of Las Pegasus entertainment.

415
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,630
Which is why we invite
each and every one of you

416
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:14,436
to experience the wonder of
the Poné Fantastique Theater

417
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,360
at half the normal
cost of admission.

418
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,018
And, while you're appreciating
this historic venue,

419
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,913
totally devoid of
performers of any kind,

420
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,812
we invite you to use the wonder
of your own imaginations

421
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:28,369
to fill the space at
no additional charge!

422
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:30,966
[excited chatter]

423
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:32,547
Applejack: FLIM AND FLAM!!
