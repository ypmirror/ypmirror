00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,360
It's just a dash and
a drop and a drip.

183
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,980
And even though Scootaloo
thinks bungee jumping

184
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,160
is the bees knees,

185
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,860
Sweetie Belle would
rather keep bees.

186
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,000
Of course, I'm allergic.

187
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,080
Who'd have thought
it would be so hard

188
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,460
to find something for
us all to do together?

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,400
Well, I know this might sound
crazy, but what if we didn't?

190
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,520
Didn't what?

191
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,160
Do things together. Well,
do everything together.

192
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,400
But we're the Cutie
Mark Crusaders!

193
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,240
And we always will be, but
I really wanna bungee jump.

194
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,660
The speed! The height!
The fall!

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,860
And I know you two
aren't interested,

196
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,720
but I wanna try
crochet.

197
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,940
Isn't there something

198
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,540
you've always wanted
to do on your own?

199
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,620
I don't know.

200
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,400
I guess I figured we'd
always do stuff together.

201
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,940
But bungee jumping
sounds just as scary

202
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,540
as crochet
sounds boring.

203
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,940
That's OK. Sweetie Belle and
I can do the things we like

204
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,710
and you can do
whatever you like.

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,900
Just as soon as you
figure out what it is.

206
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,860
I guess.

207
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,840
Great! Then we
can meet back here

208
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,950
and talk all about
what we've done.

209
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,890
But I don't know
what it'll be.

210
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,520

I can't believe it!

361

It's just what I always
imagined it would be!

362
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,260
And if it weren't for all of
you, I wouldn't even have it.

363
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,600
No problem. It's
what we do.

364
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,600
I only wish I'd realized
what you needed right away

365
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,240
instead of moping
around for no reason.

366
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,160
Well, either way, I
hope you keep dancing.

367
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,250
You know, I just might.

368
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,280
It sure is a lot of fun
and I'm pretty confident

369
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,420
I can only get better.

370
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,360
I'm sorry I was so silly about
us all doing our own things.

371
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,490
If we hadn't, I might have
never even tried dancing.

372
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,440
Or find out I
needed help.

373
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,300
With each of us going out and
trying things on our own,

374
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
we'll be three times as likely
to find ponies to help.

375
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,880
And trying new stuff
might even make us better

376
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,780
at helping them, like how
I used my bungee jumping

377
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,000
to change the sets.

378
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,240
Or my crochet to
make the costumes.

379
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
Well, one thing
is for sure:

380
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,460
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
will never be the same.

381
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,520
We'll be better!

382
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,740
YEAH!
