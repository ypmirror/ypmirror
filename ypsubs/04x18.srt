1
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:07,717
Has anypony heard from
Pinkie Pie since yesterday?

2
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:11,713
I don't see what's
so important

3
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:13,840
we had to meet her
here this early.

4
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,507
Celestia hasn't even
raised the sun yet.

5
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:20,942
I hope everything's OK.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,193
Thank goodness you're all here.
There's no time to lose.

7
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:32,928
Whoa!

8
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,006
<i>Careful.</i>

9
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:37,902
What is all this?

10
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,524
My sister Maud's
going to be here soon

11
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:41,303
and I need your help

12
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,432
taste-testing my
rock candy recipes.

13
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:45,966
Uh, we're happy to help
you, Pinkie Pie,

14
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:48,630
but this seems like an
awful lot of candy...

15
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,208
Even for you.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,024
I may have gone a
teensy bit overboard.

17
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:06,430

18
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:37,947
Everypony ready for more?

19
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,774
My teeth hurt.

20
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:44,193
I think we've had plenty.

21
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:46,755
And shouldn't you be on
your way to pick up Maud

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,806
from the train station?

23
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:50,068
But you've only tried
half of the flavors

24
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,166
and we have to choose
the perfect ones

25
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,248
before she gets here
so I have time to make more.

26
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,492
Maud is your sister;

27
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,551
I'm sure she'll love
your rock candy.

28
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,590
And I'm pretty sure
you've made enough.

29
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,525
She's only staying
for the week.

30
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:08,101
It's not just
for Maud, silly.

31
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,843
I'm making candy
for all of us.

32
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:14,997
It's part of a very important,
super-duper special tradition

33
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,103
that only the closest and
bestest of friends can share.

34
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,295
We're going to make rock
candy necklaces together.

35
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:26,419
<i>It all started when Maud and I</i>
<i>were fillies on the Rock Farm.</i>

36
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,508
<i>She taught me the Pie</i>
<i>family rock candy recipe.</i>

37
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,067
<i>It has a secret ingredient.</i>

38
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,578
<i>It's rocks.</i>

39
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:36,056
<i>And she showed me how</i>
<i>to string the pieces</i>

40
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,397
<i>to make them into a necklace.</i>

41
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,382
<i>And once we were</i>
<i>done, we'd trade.</i>

42
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,387
Maud and I have been trading
necklaces back and forth

43
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:46,435
since I moved to Ponyville.

44
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:48,723
They're a sign that we'll
always be best friends.

45
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,416
Aw, what a great tradition.

46
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:52,599
Hold on.

47
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:54,965
The "secret
ingredient" is rocks?

48
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:55,820
Yeah.

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,864
But these are a special kind
of rock that Maud discovered.

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,344
What kind of a rock are they?

51
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:02,930
I can't tell you that, silly.

52
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,514
It's a secret.

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,020
Now that Maud is heading off
to get her Rocktorate

54
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,863
in Rock Science,

55
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:11,539
this may be our last
chance to trade them

56
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:12,952
for a really long time.

57
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,778
I can't wait for
you all to meet her.

58
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,780
I just know that my best
Ponyville friends

59
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:20,146
and my best sister friend are
going to become bestest friends.

60
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:24,019
We can make bestestest friend
rock candy necklaces together!

61
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,454
She expresses herself through
fashion just like Rarity.

62
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,229
And she's really smart and loves
reading, just like Twilight.

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,453
And she's honest and
loves forest things

64
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:33,211
and is good at games and...well?

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,683
SHE'S AWESOME!

66
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,617
She sounds amazing.

67
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:39,320
But won't she start worrying

68
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:41,451
if you aren't at the train
station when she gets here?

69
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:42,468
She sure will.

70
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,434
I gotta get out of here!

71
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,560
I sure hope Maud
has an appetite.

72
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:56,487
Never met a pony, or a
critter, who didn't love

73
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,300
Granny Smith's
apple-spice muffins.

74
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:00,230
Oh! It's no use!

75
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:03,340
I simply cannot find
anything suitable to wear.

76
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,609
I doubt she'll notice
what anypony's wearing.

77
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,201
So what's the big deal?

78
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,612
The big deal is that it will be
very difficult to show Maud

79
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:15,098
what a strong fashion presence
we have in Ponyville

80
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,971
if the most fashion-forward
pony here

81
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:19,449
can't keep her hat
from falling apart.

82
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:22,961
I think we're all a little
nervous about Maud's visit.

83
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,835
She's Pinkie Pie's sister

84
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,795
and it's obvious Pinkie really
wants us to hit it off.

85
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,476
Being able to make those rock
candy necklaces together

86
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,898
is really important to her.

87
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,664
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

88
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,625
<i>WE'RE HERE.</i>

89
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:40,995
Where's Maud?

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,343
She's coming.

91
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:49,482
<i>you sure?</i>

92
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,406
She's not quite
as fast as me.

93
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:53,865
I asked Gummy to stay with
her in case she got lost.

94
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:04,161
Is she even moving?

95
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,763
WE'RE OVER HERE, MAUD!

96
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:21,937
Hmm.

97
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:23,549
Sedimentary.

98
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:25,278
Huh?

99
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:27,898
This is a sedimentary rock.

100
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:33,276
That's really fascinating,
isn't it, girls?

101
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:36,171
We're just so thrilled you
could come for a visit

102
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:37,281
before your big trip.

103
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:39,773
Pinkie Pie has told
us so much about you.

104
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:43,342
I'm Twilight and this is
Applejack, Fluttershy,

105
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:45,369
Rainbow Dash, and Rarity.

106
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,445
We're ever so
glad to meet you.

107
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,184
We're just gonna
have the best time.

108
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,187
Pinkie Pie tells me you
share my love for fashion.

109
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:59,215
I'm really into expressing
myself through my wardrobe.

110
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,681
And what is the delightful
frock you're wearing now saying?

111
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,064
It doesn't talk.

112
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,332
It's a dress.

113
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,628
Oh! Yes. Of course.
I just meant...

114
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,880
Uh. So this here's Winona.

115
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,034
<i>That's Owlowiscious...</i>

116
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:21,094
Tank, Opal, and Angel.

117
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,138
Pinkie Pie told us
you have a pet, too.

118
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,507
He's in my pocket.

119
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,975
Oooh, You have a pocket pet?

120
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:30,329
Like a tiny mouse?

121
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,678
Or a baby bird?

122
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,313
Or a trained butterfly?

123
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,274
It's a rock.

124
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,650
His name is Boulder.

125
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,946
This is going to be the best,
most awesome, funnest week ever.

126
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,803
I can't wait for us all
to become bestest friends.

127
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:04,501
Maud? Would ya care to
try one of Granny Smith's

128
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:06,037
famous apple spice muffins?

129
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:11,176
Oh, uh, ha, that's not--

130
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:17,455
It's crunchy.

131
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,795
Maud's right. They
are crunchy!

132
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,206
Yum.

133
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:28,310
So, uh, Pinkie Pie
tells us you like games.

134
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:32,520
Boulder and I sometimes play a
game called "camouflage."

135
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:34,599
It's kind of like
"hide-and-seek,"

136
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:37,082
but way more intense.

137
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,580
Awesome.

138
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:45,754
Any luck?

139
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,376
I truly wish I had spent
more time with Boulder,

140
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,835
because I'm having a very
hard time remembering

141
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:51,910
what he looks like.

142
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,751
It's like lookin' for
a pebble in a haystack.

143
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:57,215
More like, "in a pile
of pebbles."

144
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:59,949
Well, you don't have to
make it even harder.

145
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,165
Agh! I give
up.

146
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:03,281
This is impossible.

147
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:05,793
It'll hurt Maud's feelings
if we all stop playing.

148
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,133
Besides, look how much
fun Pinkie Pie is having.

149
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,585
IS THIS IT? IS THIS IT?
IS THIS IT? IS THIS IT?

150
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,593
Just a little longer, OK?

151
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,465
All right. Fine.

152
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,602
<i>Found him.</i>

153
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:20,954
Where was he?

154
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,127
He was hiding in my pocket.

155
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,079
Oh, come on!

156
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:34,236
I don't mean to interrupt,

157
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,708
but we really should get these
little critters home.

158
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,430
It's getting awfully late and
they've had a very busy day.

159
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,125
Maud and I'd better
get going, too.

160
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,643
I want her to taste
the rock candy

161
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:43,689
we're going to use for our...

162
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:46,087
...best friends necklaces.

163
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:47,178
Oh yeah!

164
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:54,963
She sure is different
from what I expected.

165
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,180
We spent all day
digging in the dirt

166
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,951
and he was in her pocket
the whole time?

167
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:02,809
On the bright side, Boulder
seemed really sweet.

168
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:04,723
He's a ROCK!

169
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:06,234
Come on, girls.

170
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,905
I'm sure Maud was just nervous
about meeting all of us.

171
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:11,235
Maybe she was just
acting a little "off"

172
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:12,850
because she's shy or somethin'.

173
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:13,765
Exactly.

174
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:17,086
It must be awfully intimidating
to meet all of us at once,

175
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,884
especially since we're
already such good friends.

176
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,681
Maybe if we spent some
time with her one-on-one

177
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:27,038
to try to get to
know her better?

178
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,025
I'm sure we'll be making those
best-friend rock candy necklaces

179
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:30,874
in no time.

180
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:33,966
<i>Where shall we start?</i>

181
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:36,706
I've chosen a few fabrics
I think would be stunning with--

182
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,679
Choices, choices, choices.

183
00:09:40,977 --> 00:09:43,849
Of course, if you don't see
anything that speaks to you,

184
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,400
I would be happy to suggest--

185
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:46,821
I like this one.

186
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,839
Pinkie Pie didn't tell
us you were so funny.

187
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:56,031
What do you mean?

188
00:09:56,524 --> 00:10:00,335
Oh, well, it's just, I
believe that is a dish towel.

189
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,632
But, it does go very
well with your complexion.

190
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,801
I'm sure I could
work my magic

191
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,491
and turn it into
something fabulous.

192
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,453
Rarity and my sister
working together

193
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,133
to design something amazing.

194
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,660
This is the best day ever!

195
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,982
Perhaps I could sew
all of these together

196
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,412
and make you something
you would like.

197
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,608
No, thanks.

198
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,676
One is enough.

199
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:28,384
Doesn't Maud make
the coolest scarves?

200
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:29,853
Quite.

201
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,720
Hello there, Hummingway.

202
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:41,765
I'm ever so happy to see you.

203
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,141
What's he saying?

204
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:46,138
He says hello, and he's
happy to see us too.

205
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,550
I wish I could
speak hummingbird.

206
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:52,085
Hummmmm, hum, hum,
hum, hummmmmm.

207
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,828
These spiders only
live in Ponyville,

208
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,142
and even though they may
look a teeny bit scary,

209
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,683
they're actually
very sweet

210
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:02,126
and help keep other, more
dangerous insects away.

211
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:04,165
I was looking at
the rock.

212
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:05,785
Oh.

213
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,511
Thanks again, Fluttershy.

214
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,480
Start thinking about which
flavors you want to put

215
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:12,915
in your best-friend
rock candy necklace.

216
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:14,398
Oh, gosh.

217
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,729
I'm not sure we're
even friends yet.

218
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:20,409
<i>Maud is a total bookworm.</i>

219
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:22,011
She loves poetry.

220
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,863
I've got lots of poetry.

221
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:25,779
Do you read anything
by Quill and Ink?

222
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:27,520
Or Flourish Prose?

223
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:30,370
I prefer to read my own poetry.

224
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:33,537
I'd love to hear some of it.

225
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:37,908
Rock. You are a rock.

226
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,079
Grey...

227
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:40,437
you are grey...

228
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,806
like a rock...

229
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:43,404
which you are.

230
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:44,507
Rock.

231
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:48,915
I've written thousands.

232
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,602
She's so prolific!

233
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,324
This next one is about rocks.

234
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:55,681
They're all about rocks.

235
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:59,668
Rocks, these are my rocks.

236
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:00,852
Sediments.

237
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,483
Make me sentimental.

238
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,220
<i>Smooth and round.</i>

239
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:05,925
<i>Asleep in the ground.</i>

240
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,364
<i>Shades of brown. And grey.</i>

241
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,420
You 'bout done peeling them
apples for the cider, Maud?

242
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,625
I think this one is done.

243
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:23,754
Oh, uh, yep.

244
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,240
That's a very interestin'
method you've got there.

245
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:29,986
Should I peel another?

246
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:31,783
NO! I mean, naw...

247
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:33,925
I'm sure there's plenty
apples in it already.

248
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,752
Can we taste it now?

249
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:37,104
Sure, why not?

250
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:45,385
WOW!

251
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,397
That's the best apple
cider I've ever had!

252
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,909
What do you think, Maud?

253
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,000
It tastes like apples.

254
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,850
Told you she was
super honest.

255
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,474
Just like you.

256
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,109
We're practically twins. Heh.

257
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,621
Yeah!

258
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:09,549
Let's see you beat that.

259
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:24,776
THAT WAS AMAZING!

260
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,958
Whoa! How'd you do that?

261
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:28,688
I threw it.

262
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,737
I guess you won
this one, Maud.

263
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:36,899
I'm not really into "winning".

264
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:44,142
Great! You're all here.

265
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,636
Maud is off looking for rocks,
so this is the perfect time

266
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:47,955
for us to set up
everything we'll need

267
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:50,220
to make our best-friend
rock candy necklaces.

268
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:54,263
What's wrong?

269
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,292
Well? I'm not sure it's the
best time to make best-friend

270
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:03,806
rock candy necklaces.

271
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,139
Why not?

272
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:06,099
Uh...

273
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,866
Well, darling, you see...

274
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,228
You're ever so
thoughtful to share

275
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,511
your special bonding
ritual with us, but...

276
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,629
But what?

277
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,706
The truth is, we've all
been trying real hard

278
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:25,075
to get closer to
Maud, but, well,

279
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,287
maybe some
ponies just don't click

280
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:28,273
the way others do.

281
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:32,934
We just wouldn't feel
right making something

282
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:36,409
that means we're best
friends if, well, we aren't.

283
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:42,068
Oh. OK.

284
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,115
If anypony needs me I'll be in
here trying to figure out

285
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:48,507
what to do with 200
pounds of rock candy.

286
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,388
<i>I feel awful,</i>
<i>just awful.</i>

287
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,340
Maybe we should have
just pretended

288
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:04,743
we were friends with Maud.

289
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,419
If we didn't tell Pinkie Pie

290
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:08,801
that we hadn't all become
the best of friends,

291
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,675
I think Maud would have.

292
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,905
Maybe. But who really knows?

293
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,872
That pony is a riddle wrapped
in a mystery inside an igneous.

294
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,555
Don't you mean
"inside an enigma"?

295
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:21,920
Nope. I mean igneous.

296
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:23,510
It's a kind of rock.

297
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,670
Ask me how I know that.

298
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:29,750
I've come up with
just the thing

299
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,980
to bring everypony
closer together.

300
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:50,846
I call it Pinkie-Rainbow-Rari-
Twi-Apple-Flutter-Maud

301
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:51,857
Fun Time!

302
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,990
Huh?

303
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,035
It combines
everypony's interests

304
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,467
into one giant activity

305
00:15:57,596 --> 00:15:58,805
that we can all enjoy together

306
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:01,754
and that will totally bring all
my bestest friends together

307
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:04,033
as bestestest friends.

308
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:05,728
You'll need these.

309
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:09,701
Like I said, "Huh?"

310
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,269
Probably better
for me to show you.

311
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:13,459
Watch this!

312
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:15,295
Applesauce tunnel for Applejack.

313
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,248
Pretty, shiny stuff for Rarity.

314
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,393
Reading material for Twilight.

315
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:24,891
Critter time for Fluttershy.

316
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,066
Cupcakes for yours truly.

317
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,322
And it's a race
for Rainbow Dash.

318
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:35,978
Pinkie Pie, what is that?

319
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:41,131
A rock slide, of course.

320
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,273
For Maud.

321
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:45,248
First you climb, then you slide.

322
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,376
I've got a bad
feelin' about this.

323
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:54,476
Huh?

324
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:01,783
<i>OH!</i>

325
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:03,516
<i>Oh, goodness.</i>

326
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:08,665
Watch out!

327
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:09,449
Huh?

328
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:13,110
Ahhhh! Help!

329
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:33,795
What? How? What?

330
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:40,915
Pinkie Pie, what
were you thinking?

331
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:43,701
I guess I wasn't.

332
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:47,884
I know how important it is
to you that your friends

333
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,293
become my friends.

334
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,564
But I just don't think
it's going to happen.

335
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:54,911
I think it would be best if I
just go back to the Rock Farm

336
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,729
and spend the rest of
the week there.

337
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:00,171
It was nice to meet you all.

338
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:03,225
Makes me happy knowing Pinkie
Pie has such good friends.

339
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:08,803
But we never even got to make
our rock candy necklaces.

340
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,755
Wait, Maud. I'll come with you.

341
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,904
I can't believe Maud
cut her trip short.

342
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:18,318
I can't believe we
nearly lost Pinkie Pie

343
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:20,255
to that ridiculous
obstacle course.

344
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:23,588
Thank goodness Maud was
able to reach her in time.

345
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,976
Did you see how
fast Maud moved?

346
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,385
And the way she smashed
that huge rock into dust?

347
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,982
How in Equestria
did she do that?

348
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:33,465
<i>Pinkie Pie was in trouble.</i>

349
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,382
Maud would move mountains
for her if she had to.

350
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:40,901
That's it! I think
I've finally realized

351
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,708
what we all have in
common with Maud.

352
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,211
Something that just might be
worthy of a very important,

353
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:46,413
super-duper special tradition

354
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:48,878
that only the closest and
bestest of friends can share.

355
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:55,139
Thank you for
coming with me.

356
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,487
I don't know how long I'll be
gone on my rock research trip.

357
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,898
I'm glad I still get to spend
some time with you before I go.

358
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,361
Me, too.

359
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:06,653
I'm sorry I put so much
pressure on everypony to bond.

360
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:10,505
I only wanted my friends to get
to know my amazing older sister.

361
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:22,788
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

362
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,931
Pinkie Pie, we're so sorry
we hurt your feelings

363
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,701
by not bonding with
Maud right away.

364
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:31,319
And Maud, we're sorry that
you felt the only way to spare

365
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:34,165
Pinkie Pie's feelings was
to leave Ponyville early.

366
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:39,006
We've seen how much you care
about Pinkie Pie, first-hoof.

367
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:42,729
Pinkie Pie's happiness means as
much to us as it does to you,

368
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,932
and we're sorry we
couldn't see it sooner.

369
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:47,617
The thing that makes us click
and creates a special bond

370
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,723
between us is how much
we ALL love Pinkie Pie!

371
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,840
Aw, shucks.

372
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:55,992
That's a pretty great thing to
have in common if you ask me.

373
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:57,719
<i>What do you think, Maud?</i>

374
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:00,755
Sure.

375
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,549
What's wrong?

376
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,548
Sorry, darling, I think
we all just thought

377
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,673
she'd be a bit more
excited about this.

378
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:12,800
Are you kidding me?

379
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,990
I've never seen her more
excited in my entire life.

380
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,650
I don't know if you've noticed
but I don't show my enthusiasm

381
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:22,234
for things quite in the
same way my sister does.

382
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,898
Uh, we noticed.

383
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:29,334
And we're totally cool with it.

384
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:41,580
Maud, we'd like to give you
something to take on your trip,

385
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:44,684
so that you remember all
your friends from Ponyville.

386
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:57,972
Thank you.

387
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,381
Try not to eat all the
candy before you leave.

388
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,260
Are those all the
necklaces Pinkie Pie sent you?

389
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:16,314
Mm hm.

390
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:18,839
You haven't eaten any of them?

391
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:20,885
I don't really like candy.

392
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,790
But I do love Pinkie Pie.

393
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:31,377
Mmmmm!
