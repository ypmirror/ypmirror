1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,240
Ahhhhhh!

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,420
Miss Rarity? How much
longer are you planning

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,100
to stay in here, darling?

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,300
Oh, dear, is somepony
else waiting?

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,350
No, no. I just don't
want you to get all,

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,960
what is word, pruney.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,320
Oh. Well, I'm just waiting for
Applejack. It's been so long

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,640
since we've had a relaxing
day at the spa together.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,030
I'm quite certain she'll be
along any moment.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,410
Hey, there, Rarity. I really
tried to get here earlier.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,280
I just can't believe how
much time my chores

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,400
are taking up these days.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,740
At least now we'll
finally get to spend some

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,900
quality spa time
together, right?

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,480
OK fillies, that's it. We're
closing up for the day.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,040
Aw, shucks, Rarity. I guess
I missed the whole day.

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,460
I sure am sorry.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,140
Me too.

20
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,000
Hi, Rarity.

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,740
Morning, Twilight. Spike.

22
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,380
Good heavens that's a
lot of empty pie plates.

23
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,880
Uh, yeah. We were just heading
to pick up some fresh pies.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,720
I don't know why we keep
running out at the castle.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,620
What are you
going to get?

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
Applejack,
actually.

27
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,180
Although I'm quite sure
she'll be too busy once again.

28
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,380
What do you mean?

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,330
Oh, nothing. It's just
that Applejack and I

30
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,870
haven't had one of our
spa days in ages.

31
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,880
You two really should set
aside some time.

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,100
Darling, I have been
trying for moons,

33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,780
but Applejack is so busy these
days, it's next to impossible.

34
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,020
Wow. I didn't realize Applejack
had so much to do.

35
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,440
Hey, Applejack. Another
order of pies, please.

36
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,830
Sure thing, Spike.

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,240
Agh!

38
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,740
I don't suppose those
pies are the last chore

39
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,480
on the schedule for today?

40
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,340
Gah! Land sakes! Is it time
for our spa day already?

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,450
Rarity, why don't you go on
ahead and I'll meet you there?

42
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,540
Ugh! Please, Applejack,
let's not kid ourselves.

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,920
Well, it ain't 'cause
I don't wanna,

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
but the work on the farm
has just been taking up

45
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,100
more and more of my time.

46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,260
I hate seeing you two not
spending time together.

47
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,436
Can't you get somepony
else in your family

48
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,540
to take over for a bit?

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
Wish I could, but Granny,
Big Mac and Apple Bloom

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,840
all have chores of their own
and today they're all busy

51
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,160
taking the harvest
to market.

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,180
I know we're not farmers,
but I'm sure Spike and I

53
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,740
could handle things
for a little while.

54
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,719
Maybe.

55
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
Is there one chore
we could do?

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,520
Well...I suppose if
you two got started

57
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,980
on feeding the pigs,

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,400
I could maybe leave
for an hour.

59
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,220
An hour of
spa perfection?

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,480
I can work with that!

61
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,840
Perfect. You head
off to the spa

62
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,830
and Spike and I will take
care of things here.

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,980
Whoa! Ugh! Whoa!

64
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,360
Uh yeah. We've totally
got everything covered.

65
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,700
OK. This list pretty
much covers everything

66
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
you need to know
to feed the pigs,

67
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,880
but uh, maybe I should go
over it with you just to--

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,620
Applejack, please, if
there's a list involved,

69
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,840
I am one hundred
percent on top of it.

70
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,899
Uh, right.

71
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,800
And don't worry
about things here.

72
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,220
Spike and I have
totally got this!

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,800
I mean, it's just feeding
the pigs. How hard can it be?

74
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,020
Uh... Twilight?

75
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,420
Whoa!

76
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,820
I'm glad we're
doing this, Rarity.

77
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,780
I've been putting work before
our spa time for too long.

78
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,721
I know we've only
got an hour,

79
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,340
but I can't wait
to have a steam.

80
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
A steam is just
the start.

81
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,560
I know exactly
what we'll do

82
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,400
and an hour will
be simply perfect.

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,680
OK, Spike. Ready
with that list?

84
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,080
Ready!

85
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,720
Let's do this!

86
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,300
Step one, open the gate.

87
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,770
OK. Step two, close the gate.

88
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,700
Huh?

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Mmm. That's what it says.

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,140
Step three, walk away.

91
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,850
Walk away? Really?

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,880
I just hope Twilight and
Spike can handle things

93
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,020
until I get back.

94
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,740
Now, Applejack,

95
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,360
if we are really to enjoy
this time together,

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,930
you simply must give
yourself over to the idea

97
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,040
that you are off duty
and try to relax.

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,100
I know. You're right. I really
am glad we're doing this.

99
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,080
And as long as
it's only an hour,

100
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,640
I'm sure everything
will be just fine.

101
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,380
Exactly. Now, kindly step
this way. Relaxation awaits.

102
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,560
Rainbow Dash?
What are you doing here?

103
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,260
Yeah. I didn't think
spa treatments

104
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,790
were your thing exactly.

105
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,890
What?

106
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,320
Oh. They're totally not.

107
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,260
At least, not the
"frou-frou" kind.

108
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,560
Ah.

109
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,100
Yeah, I-uh, I think
I tweaked something

110
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,060
at Wonderbolts practice
the other day.

111
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,980
I just came in for a deep
tissue sports massage.

112
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,200
Ah, Miss Dash? I
am so sorry,

113
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,780
but we are running
just a tad behind

114
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,840
and we're not quite
ready to start your

115
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,840
pampered muzzle massage and
indulgent hooficure just yet.

116
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,280
Oh.

117
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,380
I-I'm pretty sure that
wasn't what I signed up for.

118
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,900
But they are your usuals-

119
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,260
And it seems like you're
really busy today anyway.

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,860
I'll just come back tomorrow.

121
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,960
Uh, see you two
later. Have fun.

122
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,540
But put me down for
the same thing.

123
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,520
Too bad Rainbow
Dash just "hates" those

124
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,540
"frou-frou" spa treatments.

125
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,660
She could have joined
us for a nice steam.

126
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,460
Whoo wee! I can't wait.

127
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,200
Indeed. Although if
they couldn't fit Dashie in,

128
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,640
I wonder just how far
behind things are running.

129
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,720
Obviously we're on a
very tight schedule.

130
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,360
Well, maybe not everypony is
waiting for the steam room.

131
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,380
Oh, no, no, that's exactly
what we're waiting for.

132
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,680
Oh, I hope you're
not in a hurry.

133
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,020
So every pony here
wants a steam bath?

134
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, the solution
is obvious.

135
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,380
We'll simply have to start
our short time at the spa

136
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
with something else.

137
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,620
Huh! Nothin' doin'! I
came here to have a steam

138
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,020
and that's just
what I'm gonna get.

139
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,460
But-but it will take
most of our hour

140
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,910
just to get through
this line.

141
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,010
Rarity! My favorite
customer!

142
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,050
And Appleyack!

143
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,840
Well, it certainly has been
a long time since you two

144
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,140
were here together. So
lovely to have you back.

145
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,280
Well, I wish I
could say the same.

146
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,020
Yes, the wait time
for the steam room

147
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,270
certainly has been
getting worse lately.

148
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,680
But I'm sure we'll be
able to accommodate

149
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,180
your usual treatments.

150
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,010
Not without my steam.

151
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,920
Apparently Applejack won't
consider starting her time

152
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,400
at the spa without a steam
and we only have an hour.

153
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,050
That is a problem.

154
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,680
Applejack, where are you going?

155
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,290
Um... Why are y'all
just standing here?

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,380
Ugh! Just waiting for
the steam to build up.

157
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,800
Without steam, a steam
room's just a room

158
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,120
and I've got plenty
of those at home...

159
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,120
because I live in a mansion.

160
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,280
It has been taking longer
for the steam to reach that

161
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,720
"Ponyville Day Spa" quality.

162
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,060
We even had to add a
warm towel service.

163
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,800
So sorry for the
delay, everypony,

164
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,380
please help yourselves.

165
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,620
So, if you're not
getting enough steam,

166
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,960
that must mean there's
not enough hot water.

167
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,140
Oh Applejack, honestly,

168
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,040
can't we just start
with a hooficure?

169
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,640
We're going to
run out of time!

170
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,940
Hmmm.

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,520
Ha! Now, what do we have here?

172
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
The laundry room, of course.

173
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,620
And at this point, I'm
considering soaking my hooves

174
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
in one of the machines so my
time here isn't a total loss.

175
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,460
The Ponyville Day Spa prides
itself on sanitary conditions

176
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,520
and fresh linens
are integral part.

177
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,260
Well, sure, but have you
always run every single one

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,060
of these here machines
full-bore, all day, every day?

179
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,960
The answer is no...

180
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,620
...but ponies sure do love
their warm towel service.

181
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,180
Hmmm.

182
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,890
You are all wanting towel?

183
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Looks to me like you
don't have any left.

184
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,680
Well, like I said. Warm
towels are big hit.

185
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,280
I think I figured
out the problem.

186
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,300
You've got a small leak
and that means the steam

187
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,150
takes just a little
longer to build up

188
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,340
and while ponies wait,
they get cold.

189
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,060
Cold ponies start wrapping
themselves in towels...

190
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,960
...and all those dirty
towels have to be cleaned...

191
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,160
...because Ponyville Day Spa
prides itself on cleanliness.

192
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,280
Eh. What?

193
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,500
Basically, losing steam
makes you use more towels.

194
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,180
That means you do more laundry
which uses up the hot water

195
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,940
you need to make more
steam so the problem

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
just keeps getting worse.

197
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,700
Oh.That makes sense. I see.

198
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,780
Ah! I had no idea.

199
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,700
Wonderful!

200
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,200
Now that we've solved
the great steam mystery,

201
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,580
we can finally get
back to our...

202
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,000
significantly less than
an hour of relaxation.

203
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,760
Rarity, are you kiddin'?

204
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,860
I can't just leave
things like this.

205
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,900
I'm gonna need my tools.

206
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:22,940
Uh!

207
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,420
Whoo! Now that
that leak's fixed,

208
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,940
ponies won't get so cold

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,140
they use up all those towels
and without all that laundry,

210
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,400
there'll be plenty of hot
water for all the steam

211
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,660
anypony could want.

212
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,240
And I'll only have to be
doing wash once a day!

213
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,200
Wow, Appleyack. Have you ever
considered a career

214
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,920
in the spa industry? I'm sure
I can find something for you.

215
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,720
No thanks. I'm just
relieved I can finally relax

216
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,800
in the steam. What do
you say, Rarity?

217
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,780
Mmm. It sounds lovely,
Applejack,

218
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,620
but unfortunately...

219
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,500
...you spent so much time
fixing the steam room

220
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,280
we don't have any time
left to use it.

221
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,160
Honestly, how in Equestria
did it never occur to you

222
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
to check for leaks?

223
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,640
There's just so many other
things to worry about.

224
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,260
I suppose we get used
to the way things are

225
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,660
and we don't realize
there was problem.

226
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,440
You obviously need an outside
eye to evaluate the situation.

227
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,720
It's lucky for you Applejack
is too stubborn to relax.

228
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,760
Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity.

229
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,620
We'll just have to
do this another day.

230
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,280
Twilight and Spike should be
done feeding the pigs by now.

231
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,010
Twilight is a very capable pony.

232
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm sure she can figure
out what to do next.

233
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,280
Look, I know Twilight's a
princess and an alicorn,

234
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,920
but she isn't a farmer.

235
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,360
I've been doing farm work my
whole life and I'm not sure

236
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,020
it's something you
can just figure out.

237
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,960
Of course. Why don't
we pop back so you can explain

238
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,440
to Twilight what to do next
and then we'll come back here

239
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,620
and pick up where we left off?

240
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,460
Well, I suppose I could try,

241
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,700
assuming everything
went well so far.

242
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,120
Oh, Applejack, honestly!
How could it not?

243
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,350
Wouldn't it be
easier to just fly?

244
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,800
I told you, Spike, we're
following Applejack's list

245
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,380
to the letter and Applejack
doesn't fly--

246
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,040
Aaaaah!

247
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,340
Whoa!

248
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,170
I'm sorry, Rarity,

249
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,540
but I think I'm gonna have to
finish these chores myself.

250
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,540
Twilight, darling, how in the
world did you end up there?

251
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,300
Spike and I were just trying
to follow Applejack's list

252
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,920
as closely as possible.

253
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,300
Mmm...maybe not the best plan.

254
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,940
I'm sorry, Applejack.

255
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,860
But we never even got
started feeding the pigs.

256
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,640
That's all right, Twilight.
I know you did your best.

257
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,360
I guess a list can't really
capture all the ways I have

258
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,370
of doin' things.

259
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,820
At least you two got to spend
some time at the spa together.

260
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,220
Yeah, that must have
been super relaxing.

261
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,360
Well, if watching
Applejack fix plumbing

262
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,280
counts as relaxing, then yes.

263
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,120
What about your hour
of spa perfection?

264
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,000
As it turns out, the Ponyville
Day Spa had a few problems

265
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,700
with their steam room and
somepony refused to relax

266
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,980
until she had fixed them.

267
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't let those spa ponies

268
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,420
go another minute putting
up with problems

269
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,800
they didn't even know they had.

270
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,380
Somehow they just got used to
a huge bottleneck of ponies

271
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,940
standin' around waitin'.

272
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,420
But I took one good
look at that spa-jam

273
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,080
and I knew I had
to do something.

274
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,240
Sometimes the simplest
things can just derail

275
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,260
a whole operation.

276
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,680
Whether it's a leaky pipe
or doing too much laundry,

277
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,180
you can't just stick to the
same old way of doing things

278
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,700
and expect them to get better.

279
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,420
I mean, thinking you can is
just plum ridiculous, right?

280
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,260
It's funny when
you realize the extra work

281
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,600
they were doing was actually
making things worse.

282
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,820
I mean, I guess it's possible
to get stuck in a routine

283
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,120
where you're doing all
this extra stuff

284
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,040
and not realize it,

285
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,260
but I can't for the life
of me think of how.

286
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,200
Why are y'all starin'
at me like that?

287
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,240
Um, are you certain
everything you just did

288
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,720
is entirely necessary
to feed the pigs?

289
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,160
What? Of course! Why would
I be doin' it if it weren't?

290
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,700
See this gate here used
to squeak so loud,

291
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,380
the pigs would run to the
other side of the pen

292
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
and never come out,

293
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,780
so I open and close it to
let them know it's safe.

294
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,680
But it doesn't squeak anymore.

295
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,700
Of course not. I
fixed that ages ago.

296
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,960
Then I realized putting a
little fright into 'em

297
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,400
got them all hustlin'
out of the pen.

298
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,920
They don't look
scared to me.

299
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,880
Well, no, they got
used to it.

300
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,900
Which is why I started doing
the chicken dance to show 'em

301
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,520
that if they didn't get to
eatin' their food,

302
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,700
the chickens would.

303
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,660
Of course, being a chicken,

304
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,120
I couldn't very
well open the gate.

305
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,280
Getting the food bucket to
spill into the trough

306
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,620
was just a happy accident

307
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,640
because one time I left
it there by mistake.

308
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,740
Uh Applejack, it seems like
everything you're doing

309
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,300
is to fix things that aren't
really problems anymore.

310
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,430
Well, I'll be.

311
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,560
Hm. Maybe it isn't so
hard to get stuck

312
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,500
doing extra work after all.

313
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,520
Huh, I wonder if I've been
doing that around here

314
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,500
with anything else?

315
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,160
Well, there's only
one way to find out!

316
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,260
Thanks y'all. I
guess I just got so used

317
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,760
to doing everything
a certain way,

318
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,080
I didn't realize there
were any problems.

319
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,100
Having a friend look
at what you're doing

320
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,220
with an outside eye
can really help.

321
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
Um-hm. And I suppose
if it weren't for our

322
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,540
unsuccessful time at the spa,

323
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,280
none of us would
have realized it.

324
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,620
Well, now that your
chores are streamlined,

325
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,500
what are you going to do
with all the extra time?

326
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,920
I think I have a few ideas.

327
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,480
Think you can come
up with enough things

328
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,940
for us to do now that we have
more time to relax?

329
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,580
Oh please, I could plan a
week's worth of treatments.

330
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,820
Huh. Well, let's
just start with the

331
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,940
rest of the day for now.

332
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,000
After all the work we
just did on the farm,

333
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,100
I am ready for some
serious relaxation.

334
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,720
Thanks for letting me
know there was an opening.

335
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,720
I don't know if I could
make it without my

336
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,580
pampered muzzle massage.

337
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,940
Don't worry about it.

338
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,580
Shall I put you down for
another one tomorrow?

339
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,580
Oh, absolutely.

340
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,900
Sometimes a girl just has to
pamper herself, am I right?

341
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,240
<i>You</i>
<i>certainly are.</i>

342
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,940
Oh. Oh! Hey! I
was just, uh, uh...

343
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,980
Getting a "sports"
pamperin'?

344
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,280
Don't
worry, Rainbow Dash.

345
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,500
We were just heading in for
some pampering ourselves.

346
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,380
You could always join us.

347
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,720
That is if you don't mind
suffering through

348
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,860
one or two "frou-frou"
treatments.

349
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,160
Ah, I suppose I could take
it. You know, for you ponies.

350
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,780
Busted!

351
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,100
Yeah.
