1
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,080
Happy Hearth's Warming Eve!

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,340
Shucks, Twilight, y'all done
it up nice and cozy in here.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,100
We're about to hang our
Hearth's Warming Dolls,

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,180
if you want to join us.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,150
Well, that's mighty
sweet of you,

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,860
but we're just stopping
in to wish y'all

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,560
a happy Hearth's
Warming before we go.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,260
I think it's sweet
that your families

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,730
are spending the
holiday together.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Picture the most funtacular
thing you can think of.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,500
Now multiply that times
infinity! IT'S GONNA BE GREAT!

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,760
That's us! See you later!

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,880
Now can we open presents?

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,680
But tonight is
Hearth's Warming Eve.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,660
Everypony knows you don't
open presents till tomorrow.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,150
When Spike and I spent our first
Hearth's Warming Eve together,

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,490
he couldn't wait all night
to open his presents.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,600
Ever since then, we've always
opened them the night before.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,460
It's kinda like...
our tradition.

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,800
That's not how our
family does it.

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,160
And I reckon it can't be how
Pinkie's does it, is it?

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,860
No, sir-eee!

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,800
To each their own, I suppose.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,960
AH! GOTTA GO! BYE!

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,480
Just what I always
wanted! A book!

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:49,320
Hearing impaired subtitles
by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

27
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,400
Chancellor Puddinghead Puddings?

28
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,900
How about a
Windigo-frosted snow cone?

29
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,860
It's so exciting. Related or
not, it's gonna be a hoot

30
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,780
havin' our families
together under one roof.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,160
Apples and Pies, together again
for the first time, maybe,

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,020
unless we're related,
which maybe we're not.

33
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,720
I think I just
confused myself.

34
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,520
Friends or family, this
here's about togetherness.

35
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,120
Have you tried the
Equestria Flag Crepes?

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,920
The blue is BLUEBERRY!

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,860
And don't tell Granny I saw, but
her trunk is full of presents!

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,220
Now hang
on, Sugarcube.

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,900
You know Hearth's
Warming isn't just about

40
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,560
candy and presents, right?

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,900
Uh oh. That's your boring
sisterly lecture voice.

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,760
'Fraid so. Ahem. A long
time ago, the Earth Ponies,

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,460
<i> Pegasus Ponies,and Unicorn</i>
<i> Ponies weren't friends.</i>

44
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,840
"I don't like you!"

45
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,620
"I don't like
you either!"

46
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,220
<i> But then the icy</i>
<i> chill of the Windigos</i>

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,140
<i> almost iced up everything.</i>

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,890
<i> So the ponies decided</i>
<i> to work together</i>

49
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,960
<i> and their friendship drove</i>
<i> them nasty critters away.</i>

50
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,760
"Beat it, Windigos!"

51
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,540
<i> Triumphant, they raised</i>
<i> a new flag to celebrate</i>

52
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,720
<i> all three tribes, and</i>
<i> Equestria was born.</i>

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
Uh, what happened
to the flag...?

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,880
I don't know.

55
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,880
Is that why we celebrate
with a flag-raising tomorrow?

56
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,200
Mm-hm. And tonight we'll
have the traditional

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Hearth's Warming Eve Dinner

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,380
to remember the shared
bounties of our ancestors.

59
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,990
We do that, too!

60
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,700
Then we'll hang our
Hearth's Warming Dolls

61
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,720
over the fireplace, to remind
us of the warmth shared

62
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,990
on that fateful night.

63
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,400
That's what our family does too!

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,040
And tomorrow, we open presents.

65
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,100
WE DO THAT TOO!

66
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,720
It sounds like the
Apples and the Pies

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,340
do everything the same way.

68
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,200
Of course! We might be related!

69
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,510
Hey, I was going to say that!

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,910
Stop saying what I'm saying!

71
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,560
You stop it first!

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,300
I'm so happy I need to make up
a new word for how happy I am.

73
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,420
What about, "Rooftastic!"?

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,340
Rooftastic?

75
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,040
As in: I gotta get on the
roof and yell to everypony

76
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,200
HOW ROOFTASTIC THIS IS!

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,360
What if our families
don't like each other?

78
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,340
We are friends,
Applejack.

79
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,900
And after tonight, our families
are going to be friends too!

80
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,240
Do you know what
that means?

81
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,658
Number of Apples times
number of Pies is 24

82
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,720
minus my pre-existing
friendships plus 1 for Maud

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,220
and you makes 5 from 24 is--

84
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,880
Nineteen new friendships!

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,880
Maud!

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm so excited to see you,
Pinkie Pie. You too, Applejack.

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,320
I hope you had fun
sledding yesterday.

88
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,970
How'd you know that?

89
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,280
Isn't it obvious?

90
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,460
There's specks of Extrusive
Andesite on your hoof.

91
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,620
It's a mountain rock.

92
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,980
Oh... she's good.

93
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,060
How's school going?

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,080
If you thought Quartz was high
on the Mohs Hardness Scale,

95
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,020
wait'll I tell you
about Corundum.

96
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,280
I missed you so much!

97
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,960
This place looks amazing!

98
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,840
C'mon everypony, meet my
super-mega-funderful family!

99
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,520
Everypony... meet... everypony!

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,420
Surely thy name is
not but Granny Smith.

101
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,020
I am called Igneous Rock Pie,
son of Feldspar Granite Pie.

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,730
Thou shalt know me
as Cloudy Quartz.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,470
May providence favor thee
well and to thou comfort

104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,860
our humble homestead bring.

105
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,500
Y'all gabbin' with
words real funny-like.

106
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,960
What'd ya say them names were:

107
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,300
"Iggy?" And I'm just gonna
call you, "Big Mama Q."

108
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,460
Gaze into the eyes
of Limestone Pie.

109
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,760
Ma and Pa may own this rock
farm, but I keep it running.

110
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,160
Cross me and--

111
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,180
--Aye aye, Captain Grumpy!

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,300
No one's gonna mess
with your precious mine.

113
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,420
Or Holder's Boulder!

114
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,080
Everypony stay away
from Holder's Boulder.

115
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,480
There, you happy now?

116
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,560
And you must be...

117
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,660
This is Marble
Pie, my baby sister

118
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,010
who's only a few
minutes younger than me

119
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,560
but she'll always be a baby
to me, isn't that right?

120
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,460
She's so excited
to meet everypony!

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,060
Oh, and she wishes you all
a happy Hearth's Warming!

122
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,180
Mmm-hmm.

123
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,840
Guess Pinkie Pie always
did the talkin' for her.

124
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,420
ATTENTION!

125
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,440
What'd I say about the boulder?

126
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,680
I'll just be a second!

127
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,940
Everypony, get settled in.
There's plenty of room upstairs,

128
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,260
and then it's time for
Hearth's Warming Eve Dinner!

129
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,100
So far, so good "cousin!"

130
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,940
Hee Hee!

131
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,420
I can't wait to taste
their fresh sweet rolls.

132
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
They're my favorite part of
Hearth's Warming Eve Dinner.

133
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,140
I'm more of a six-layer
bean dip filly, myself.

134
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,220
I love that too! Oh, Applejack,

135
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,580
do you think theirs will
be even better than ours?

136
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,480
Oh, that's a mighty tall order,

137
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,700
but it wouldn't surprise
me in the least.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Are you excited for dinner
time because guess who is?

139
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Spoiler alert: it's ME!

140
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,440
What about hot rolls? And mulled
cider? And double-baked pot-pie?

141
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,660
What about 6-layer bean dip?

142
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,560
We have rock soup.

143
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,140
Potato, po-tah-to!
Double-baked-pot-pie, rock soup!

144
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,640
Dinner is dinner, Am
I right or am I right?

145
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,640
Yeah, um... you know what?

146
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,900
This is what we were
expecting, right everypony?

147
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,420
Heh heh.

148
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,720
Is everything all
right, Applejack?

149
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,340
Of course. I'm just
bein' a rusty fiddle.

150
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,270
Tune me up and let's
get back to dinner!

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,100
More rock, please!

152
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,560
Eat up, so we can get to
our Hearth's Warming dolls!

153
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,980
Now that's somethin'
I know all about.

154
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,500
Who wants a Hearth's
Warming doll?

155
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,220
Are you sayin' that rock
is a Hearth's Warming Doll?

156
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,700
Don't be silly, silly.

157
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,980
Our dolls are these
little pieces!

158
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,640
Isn't that right, Marble Pie?

159
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,380
Mm-hm.

160
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,540
Our dolls... are rocks?

161
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,540
Y'all don't have
traditional crocheted dolls

162
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,060
passed down in your family?

163
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,160
Ohhhh, you're just
a frown factory

164
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,880
because you got a weird rock.

165
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,520
Cheer up! I'm sure
you'll do great in the

166
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,780
Flag-Finding Mission.

167
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,480
What-findin' what-now?

168
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,820
Limestone Pie, you're the judge.

169
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,200
Big Mac? Marble
Pie? You're team 1.

170
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,340
Apple Bloom and
Maud? You're team 2.

171
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Ma? Pa? You're gonna
be with Granny Smith.

172
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,480
Don't think of it as "team old,"
think of it as team three.

173
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,630
And I'm with
Applejack, of course!

174
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,120
Since we might be cousins!

175
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,930
So now that we're all split up,

176
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,600
mind tellin' us
what we're doing?

177
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,740
As everypony knows--

178
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,860
STAY OFF HOLDER'S BOULDER!

179
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,120
Sheesh.

180
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,480
When the three tribes
united to form Equestria,

181
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,040
the first flag was
sewn by Nimble Thimble.

182
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,800
It's tradition to raise a
flag on Hearth's Warming

183
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,980
to celebrate that famous day.

184
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,300
But who gets to put the
flag on Holder's Bolder?

185
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,560
You mean on the flagpole?

186
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,580
No, silly!

187
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,780
It goes on the highest point.
And who's the lucky pony?

188
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,480
Traditionally, it's
the youngest...

189
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,100
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO!

190
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,380
Pinkie Pie, will you please
tell us what's going on?

191
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,440
I'll explain on the way!

192
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,410
Oh!

193
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,080
I still don't understand.

194
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,720
Earlier today, Limestone
Pie hid an obsidian stone.

195
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,340
Whoever finds it gets
to raise the flag!

196
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,580
It's all just so...
complicated. And "rock-based."

197
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,180
Well, how else would we do it?

198
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't know.

199
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,360
I sure hope everypony else
is havin' a better time.

200
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,640
Mmm-hmm.

201
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,140
Eyup.

202
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,560
Mmmmmmm-hmm.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,460
Eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyup.

204
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,240
So, how'd ya meet
this Iggy fella?

205
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,640
We were chosen by
the pairing stone

206
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,810
and betrothed
within a fortnight.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,740
The choosing stone decreed
"thou shalt love one another,"

208
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,120
and lo, it was so.

209
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,040
Hoo-wee. I gotsta look into this
oldfangled choosin' stone thing.

210
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,420
Do you reckon it knows
any Apple farmin' hunks?

211
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,880
Indeed so.

212
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,740
What does the rock look like?

213
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,620
It looks like
something that formed

214
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,540
when volcanic lava
cooled quickly.

215
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,300
Oh.

216
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,780
Have you ever wished you
could turn into a rock?

217
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,960
I had a dream once
I was an apple.

218
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,440
We have a lot in common

219
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,120
when it comes to thinking
about turning into things.

220
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
FOUND IT!
FOUND IT! FOUND IT!

221
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,680
A picture? I been lookin'
for a real stone, Pinkie Pie.

222
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,100
Um, that would be weird. Do
you know what this means?

223
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,180
I get to raise the flag! And now
it's time to hide the presents!

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,470
Y'all hide your presents?

225
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,560
Of course! What's more fun
than getting a present?

226
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,110
FINDING A PRESENT!

227
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,740
Although most years
nopony finds one.

228
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,480
So nopony gets presents?

229
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,050
Not usually.

230
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,980
So let me get all this straight.

231
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,260
You're only allowed to
eat Rock Soup for dinner.

232
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,640
Then, the pony who finds this
rock gets to raise the flag,

233
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,100
but not really cause you
don't got no flag pole.

234
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,680
And to top it off, you
don't even get presents?

235
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,760
Well, it doesn't sound very
fun when you say it THAT way.

236
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Well, how about
you picture this:

237
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,200
both our families, opening
presents, raising the flag...

238
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,140
Picturing it, loving it!

239
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,980
Goodnight, everypony!

240
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,390
Goodnight, Pinkie Pie!

241
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
We gotta do something, y'all.

242
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,030
Pinkie Pie's family's never
had a real Hearth's Warming.

243
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,100
Is that really what she said?

244
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,500
Well, I'm sure it's
what she meant.

245
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,870
These are their traditions.

246
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,640
Eyup.

247
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,260
I know they have their
traditions and we have ours,

248
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,760
but I just want them to see how
much better theirs could be.

249
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,720
Hearth's Warming!

250
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,460
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming!

251
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,320
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming!

252
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,780
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Wa-

253
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,560
Oh, my, oh my.

254
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,800
What. Happened. To. My. Farm.

255
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,720
It's Hearth's
Warming, Apple style!

256
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,600
We've been doing
everything your way.

257
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,460
I thought we could
mix it up a bit.

258
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,820
Marble Pie, you could raise the
Equestria flag up this pole,

259
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,460
because you're the youngest Pie.

260
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,340
Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up
a meal you'll never forget.

261
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,840
And look, we all get presents
without having to find 'em!

262
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,290
Yeah! This is going to be great!

263
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,700
All the stuff she
said. Right, everypony?

264
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Pinkamina Diane Pie, truly thou
do not favor this madness?

265
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Well, I want to
be one big family.

266
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,640
But what about
what we usually do?

267
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,340
I, um, well? I don't know!
Don't make me choose!

268
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,450
I didn't mean to cause a fuss.

269
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,040
Why don't we just open
presents around the flagpole.

270
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,720
It'll be fun, you'll see.

271
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,550
Excuse me. You planted
your pole on a fault line.

272
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,180
NOOOOOOOO!

273
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,300
Oh boy.

274
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,100
You didn't have to
ask them to leave.

275
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,380
They wanted to go.

276
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,380
We don't need anypony forcing
their way into our family.

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,100
This was all a
misunderstanding, everypony.

278
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,320
I know Applejack,

279
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,940
and she'd never do
anything bad to anypony.

280
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,940
Look around, Pinkie Pie.

281
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,230
It's gonna take me ages to get
this rock farm back on track.

282
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,500
And how're we gonna
lift Holder's Boulder?

283
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,470
This is all her fault.

284
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,680
Then it's my fault too.

285
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,680
Probably best if we head
back to Sweet Apple Acres.

286
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,820
Maybe in time we'll
be friends again.

287
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,450
But for the now it's best if
we give them a little space.

288
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,760
I wish we didn't have
to. I really like Maud.

289
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,060
She's sweet once you get
to know her. They all are.

290
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,600
Worst Hearth's Warming ever.

291
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,400
Has anypony seen Applejack?

292
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,780
I really cracked
the corn this time.

293
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,600
I really popped the
piñata this time.

294
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,620
Pinkie Pie?

295
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,680
Ah! What are you
doing here?

296
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,160
What are you
doing here?

297
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,880
I came here to think.

298
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,220
You did? So did I!

299
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,030
I'm too ashamed to
go back up there.

300
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,080
Your family, my family?

301
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,500
They all must think
I'm such a nincompoop.

302
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,120
Aw, no one thinks that.

303
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,520
Pushy, aggressive, mean.
Oh I'm not helping, sorry.

304
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm sorry I forced my
traditions over yours.

305
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,280
I don't want you to have to
choose between the family

306
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,020
you were born into, and the
friends who love you like one.

307
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,090
I really hoped we could be
one big family. I guess not.

308
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,460
Don't say that!

309
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,400
I wish I could stay but
I have a train to catch.

310
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,740
Hap... hap... happy
Hearth's Warming.

311
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,080
You, too.

312
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,200
You wanna know why Holder's
Boulder's so dangit important?

313
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,100
Well, now, their great great
great great great grandfather,

314
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,060
Holder Cobblestone, he found
that boulder in a Dragon's nest,

315
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,940
older than time itself.

316
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,520
He built the family
farm around it,

317
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
even though it was just
an ordinary rock.

318
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
It's always brought
them good luck.

319
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,960
Crickets! That is important.

320
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,660
I got so caught up in the
things they were doin',

321
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,460
I never asked why they did 'em.

322
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,500
"To Applejack, from Pinkie
Pie. ...cousins forever."

323
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,680
You just found your first Pie
Hearth's Warming present ever!

324
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,280
Only Pinkie Pie could hide a
present on a moving train.

325
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,120
What a great tradition!

326
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,260
STOP THE TRAIN!

327
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
C'mon, you boulder, c'mon!

328
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,020
I'm pushing as
hard as I can, too.

329
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,980
Oh, it's hopeless.

330
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,660
Need a
little help?

331
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,380
Apples!

332
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,960
What do you want?

333
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,040
I wasn't trying to take
your traditions away;

334
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,080
I was trying to share ours.

335
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,200
I was so focused on us
bein' one big happy family,

336
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,720
I thought we needed the
same traditions right away.

337
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,840
What I shoulda done
is learn about yours

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,320
and teach you about ours.

339
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,620
And over time, we'd make
new traditions together.

340
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,740
I'm sorry, y'all.

341
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,720
Well, don't just stand there.

342
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,380
We got a boulder
to move!

343
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,620
And I'm in charge!

344
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,660
I think we just invented our
first combined tradition!

345
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,240
Pushing Holder's Boulder
out of the Quarry!

346
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,700
I can't wait for
Applejack to knock it over

347
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,200
next Hearth's Warming!

348
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,000
Marble Pie, you want to wish Big
Mac a happy Hearth's Warming,

349
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,430
don't you? And you
too, right, Big Mac?

350
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,520
Mm-hm.

351
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,180
Eyup.

352
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,720
Uh, let me see here.
"If thou asketh me...

353
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,610
Thou two art OK-eth in my book."

354
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,720
"Yee...haw?"

355
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,650
Happy Hearth's Warming.

356
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,700
Happy Hearth's
Warming, Pinkie Pie.

357
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,080
Attention, everypony!

358
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,300
Maud wants to sing some Hearth's
Warming carols that she wrote!

359
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,480
The first one is about rocks.

360
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,680
They're all about rocks.

361
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,860
Hearth's Warming is great,

362
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,780
like Calcium Silicate.

363
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,340
What a wonderful day,

364
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,560
as good as Mica or Clay...
