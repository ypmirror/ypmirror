1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,335
This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!

2
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,038
Awesome!

3
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:16,416
You know, this shower only happens
once every 100 years.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,360
A centennial celebration!

5
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:20,884
We better get a move on!

6
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:22,485
Don't wanna be late!

7
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:26,912
There.

8
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,977
Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?

9
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:30,089
Check!

10
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:31,197
Scrolls?

11
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:32,240
Check!

12
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:35,453
I've also packed a telescope,
apples, bananas, fruit punch...

13
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:39,465
...and my freshly baked home-made
triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!

14
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:41,765
I can see that.

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,452
Once again you read my mind, Spike.

16
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:49,766
And that is why you are my number one assistant.

17
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:52,545
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,416
That is why you are my number one assistant.

19
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,213
Missed that! Huh...?

20
00:00:58,515 --> 00:00:59,746
I said...!

21
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:03,943
Come on, let's get going.

22
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,162
Wait! I almost forgot.

23
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:09,873
I wanna bring the "Astronomical Astronomer's
Almanac to All Things Astronomy".

24
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:12,403
The Astronomo-lomo homono what?

25
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:17,339
You know that really old big blue book
on stars, moons, planets, the Universe...?

26
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:18,870
Right. Check!

27
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:40,614
Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?

28
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,795
I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back.

29
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:28,986
The book would have helped me identify
different planets and stars tonight.

30
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,307
Well... Maybe someone borrowed it?

31
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:34,723
Besides, you don't need that book.

32
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:37,908
You can already name
all the planets and stars, cause...

33
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,204
...you're super smart and...

34
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,622
...astronomically awesome!

35
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:43,563
Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.

36
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,173
Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.

37
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:48,060
And a number one assistant, right?

38
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,959
Check!

39
00:02:56,779 --> 00:03:00,029
Wow, Twilight! You're lucky
to have such a rad assistant.

40
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:02,239
I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.

41
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,382
Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me!

42
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,506
I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!

43
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:08,775
Oh yeah, pipsqueak?

44
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,860
How about taking out the trash?

45
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:12,050
Yes, ma’am!

46
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:16,544
Do we have Spike to thank again
for this amazing spread?

47
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,356
Isn't he simply amazing?

48
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,676
Oh, come on.

49
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,682
I said come on.

50
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:26,603
Little Spikey-wikey!

51
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:30,509
Who knew that big ferocious dragon
started off so cutesy wootsy?

52
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:35,727
Spike, you are such a little star,
that I had to make a little bow tie for you.

53
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:41,739
Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it.

54
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,071
Twilight, your turn.

55
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,740
Spike, that's enough.

56
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:47,427
All right. That's enough.

57
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:49,649
Hey, everypony! The show is starting!

58
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:09,794
Wow...

59
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:13,884
Huh?

60
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:32,918
Wow! These cookies are deeleesh!

61
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:34,288
Spike made them.

62
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:37,275
Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch?

63
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:39,882
Spike?

64
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,033
Ooh, poor little thing.

65
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,937
Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.

66
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:49,601
And now the punch has been...

67
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:50,984
...spiked!

68
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:59,378
Goodnight, Spike.

69
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:05,585
Sweet dreams, number one assistant.

70
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,874
"The Study of Comets."

71
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:15,373
"Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies..."

72
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:19,139
"...that are made of non-volatile grains
and frozen gasses. They..."

73
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:40,250
"...have body structures
that are fragile and diverse..."

74
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:47,484
Shoot!

75
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,833
Oh... This is a job for Spike.

76
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,222
If only he were awake...

77
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,281
Hoo!

78
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,045
Wait! Don't go!

79
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:06,175
Don't be afraid.

80
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,826
Thank you for returning my scroll.

81
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:10,154
Hoo! Hoo!

82
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:12,472
Uhoo.

83
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:14,353
Gosh, it's cold tonight.

84
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:18,142
Say, would you like to relax in here
and keep me company while I work?

85
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:20,659
Hoo! Hoo!

86
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:21,990
Now, where was I?

87
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:26,665
Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with
a surrounding cloud of material called a coma..."

88
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,547
"...that grows in size and brightness
as the comet approaches the sun..."

89
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,211
I overslept!

90
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,160
I know it's already ten, but...

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,445
...I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed...

92
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:41,933
...and ready to work twice as fast.

93
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,065
Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight.

94
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:44,472
And what do you want for breakfast? Oatmeal?

95
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,250
How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?

96
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,902
Spike, don't worry.

97
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:49,652
But my morning chores...

98
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:52,712
It's okay. Owloysius did them for you.

99
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,118
Who?

100
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:55,966
He's our new junior assistant.

101
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:59,542
He's gonna help out with your chores
so you won't be so tired all the time.

102
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,312
Wha... Wh...

103
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:02,942
What do we need a junior assistant for?

104
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,762
I'm not tired. I do fine on my own.
I don't need sleep, I...

105
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:09,192
Spike, don't worry.
He's just here to help out a little.

106
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:12,596
Now, I have to go out. So why don't you
introduce yourself to Owloysius?

107
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:13,999
He's in the library.

108
00:07:14,462 --> 00:07:16,669
Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried.

109
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:17,574
Who's worried?

110
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:21,852
Hello?

111
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:23,575
Hellooo!

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,562
Whoa!

113
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:30,196
Dude, that's creepy.

114
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:32,252
Uh... Hi there!

115
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,415
I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight
has told you all about me...

116
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:36,658
Hoo.

117
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:39,198
Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?

118
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:39,981
Hoo?

119
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:41,955
I'm Spike!

120
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:44,487
And who are you? And what are you?

121
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:45,330
Hoo!

122
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,563
-Who?
-Hoo!

123
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:47,809
I thought your name was Owloysius!

124
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:48,326
Hoo?

125
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:51,297
Okay, "Who", "Owloysius", whatever.

126
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,639
I'm Spike, okay?

127
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,498
Look! All you need to know
is that I'm number one...

128
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,276
...and you're number two. Got it?

129
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,059
Hoo?

130
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:02,819
So, a man of mystery, huh?

131
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,889
I'm keeping my eye on you!

132
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,799
I've got eyes in the back
of my head too, you know?

133
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:13,285
Well, not really, but...

134
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,530
You know what I mean!

135
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:18,012
That bird is out for my job.

136
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:19,451
He wants to be number one.

137
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:22,438
I'll prove to Twilight that
I deserve to be number one.

138
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:24,203
Not Freaky Feathers over there.

139
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,899
I won't let him have my job
if it's the last thing I do!

140
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:39,294
Oh, what a fantastical,
fluffelicious feathery little friend!

141
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,682
I'm... HOOked!

142
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,314
He's just wonderful.

143
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,496
"He's just wonderful."

144
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:50,844
Uh, yes. Wonderful.

145
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:51,981
He's quite...

146
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,435
...the charmer.

147
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:56,583
And Owloysius's just such a star...

148
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,133
...I just had to make this little bow for you.

149
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,480
What's he all saddle sore about?

150
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,122
He's probably just jealous of Owloysius.

151
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:15,526
Maybe Spike feels threatened
or worried that Owloysius will replace him?

152
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,155
Replace him? Hah! It's crazy!

153
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:20,555
Spike knows he can't be replaced.

154
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:22,677
They're trying to replace me!

155
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:25,612
I better step it up and make sure
that Twilight and Owloysius...

156
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,550
...know that I'm still number one...

157
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,321
Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book
called Two-headed Myth...

158
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,103
...Mythological Mysteries!

159
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:39,229
I know where it is.

160
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:45,032
Thanks, Owloysius.

161
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:46,938
Hey, Spike, no worries.

162
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:49,102
Owloysius flew up and got the book for me.

163
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:51,877
Oh, and gee!

164
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,076
I guess I need Ferrets of Fairyland too.

165
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:56,057
Hey!

166
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:59,491
Climb down from there before you fall.

167
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:07,300
Shoot!

168
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:08,537
Yes, sir!

169
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:11,003
My last writing quill. It's broken.

170
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:14,177
Never fear, Spike, your
number one assistant, is here.

171
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,028
Quill... quill... Where is it?

172
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:18,014
Not here...

173
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,253
Quill...

174
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,804
Quill, where is it...?

175
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,001
Hoo.

176
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,535
Where am I gonna get a quill?

177
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:34,803
Spike, wait! Wait!

178
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:40,024
But the store is called "Quills and Sofas".

179
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:42,102
You only sell two things!

180
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:44,884
Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday.

181
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,516
Need sofa?

182
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,913
I swore I had one here somewhere.

183
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:52,483
Ah, here it is!

184
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:53,635
A quince!

185
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,558
Not a quince. A quill!

186
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:57,422
Right. A quail?

187
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,680
A quilt!

188
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:01,259
A quesadilla?

189
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:03,127
Aha!

190
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,753
A quiche!

191
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:07,262
Not a quiche. A quill!

192
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:09,766
Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.

193
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,506
Shoot.

194
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,116
Come on, chicken!

195
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:17,243
Here, chicky chicky chicky!

196
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,764
Here, chick chick chick chicky!

197
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:19,973
Come here!

198
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,798
Come here!

199
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,874
Spike...

200
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,284
...to the rescue.

201
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:44,219
Oh, Spike.

202
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:47,310
I was calling out for you when you were
turning this place upside down.

203
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,086
Owloysius gave me one of
his feathers to use as a quill.

204
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,150
That's just great.

205
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,034
Perfect!

206
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,074
Sweet!

207
00:11:58,627 --> 00:11:59,926
I think I'll just, uh...

208
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,664
...finish up the rest of my chores!

209
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:03,947
Or did Owloysius already do them?

210
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:06,526
Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.

211
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:09,663
Well, that's fine. Because I can just
stay up all night and finish...

212
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:14,902
Poor Spike.

213
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,542
He'll come around.

214
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,446
He's genuinely a good little guy.

215
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:27,725
Spike. What is this?

216
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,563
You said this book was missing.

217
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:32,076
Well, Owloysius found it right where it belongs...

218
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,470
...but like this.

219
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:35,117
How did it get this way?

220
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:37,213
Uh... Well, um...

221
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:38,394
You see, I...

222
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:41,884
I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh...

223
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,065
Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?

224
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:45,965
I've seen a dragon lie.

225
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,381
I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.

226
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,178
You set me up!

227
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,489
Well, two can play that game.

228
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:56,472
Hoo!

229
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:58,747
Not "who"! Two!

230
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:04,662
Owloysius is out to take my place. I just know it!

231
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:06,276
I've gotta stop him.

232
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:07,738
But how?

233
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:14,829
Ah...

234
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:27,614
Come along, Opal.

235
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:29,882
Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.

236
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,038
So lifelike.

237
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,894
And when Twilight discovers it
shredded up on her floor...

238
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:57,277
...she'll think mouse-eating Owloysius is to blame.

239
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:59,587
And I'll be number one...

240
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,284
...again!

241
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,075
That poor little field mouse!

242
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,947
Torn to pieces!

243
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:51,627
It must have been Owloysius!

244
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:53,867
You know, since owls eat, you know, mice.

245
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,706
What a terrible, terrible bird!

246
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,102
He must be punished!

247
00:14:58,505 --> 00:14:59,153
Right?

248
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,663
Spike! I don't know what upsets me more.

249
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:05,223
That you deliberately tried to set up Owloysius...

250
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:08,101
...or that you actually thought
this pathetic attempt would work!

251
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:11,047
You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike.

252
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:12,944
I am truly disappointed.

253
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:16,048
This is NOT the Spike I know and love.

254
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:23,670
She...

255
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,562
She doesn't love me anymore.

256
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,431
Twilight hates me.

257
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:35,928
I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely.

258
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:37,844
Could it get any worse?

259
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:43,708
I guess that's a yes.

260
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,929
Hello?

261
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:54,976
Hello!

262
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,146
What is that?

263
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,833
If this is what running away is all about...

264
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,237
...I never wanna go home!

265
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,627
Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!

266
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:24,080
Even if my tummy's full...

267
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,226
...the rest of me is still empty.

268
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,188
I miss Twilight and the pony gang.

269
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,657
But she doesn't love me anymore.

270
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:33,987
So, I'm better off here.

271
00:16:34,442 --> 00:16:35,988
All by myself.

272
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:40,376
Wow. Seems to be getting warmer.

273
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:44,198
The steam is great for my complexion...

274
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,402
...but it's sure getting hot in here.

275
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,696
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY CAVE?

276
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:57,280
AND WHY ARE YOU EATING MY GEMS?

277
00:16:58,998 --> 00:16:59,937
Heyah bro!

278
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:01,907
I didn't know this was your cave.

279
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,704
And I didn't know these were your gems, but...

280
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,026
...we're cool, right?

281
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:06,029
Whoa, whoa!

282
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,536
Hey... We're like brothers, you know?

283
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:11,176
I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon...

284
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,797
It's us against the world, right?

285
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:17,783
You don't scare me!

286
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:19,003
So you're big.

287
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,780
Really big.

288
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,614
And your claws are super sharp.

289
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:26,713
Tail...

290
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:29,239
...extra spiky.

291
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,358
But, uh...

292
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,442
You don't scare me! Ha!

293
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:35,627
How'd you like that?

294
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:41,533
Uh...

295
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,376
I'd love to stay, but gotta go!

296
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:44,941
See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

297
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:05,722
Uhoo!

298
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,522
Spike! Over here!

299
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:28,170
Am I glad to see you!

300
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,910
Hurry! Hop on!

301
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,942
It's too dark! I can't see!

302
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,967
Hoo. Hoohoo!

303
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,840
Spike. We were so worried about you.

304
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,593
*I* was so worried about you.

305
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,224
Why did you run away?

306
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:15,724
I thought you didn't need me anymore.

307
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,967
And that you didn't love me anymore.

308
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,805
Spike. Sure, I was disappointed...

309
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:23,988
...but you are my number one assistant!

310
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,344
And friend.

311
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,097
And you always will be.

312
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:29,902
It's just that sometimes I need some help at night.

313
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,216
I can't ask you to stay up late.

314
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:35,113
You're a baby dragon and you need your rest.

315
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:38,982
Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owloysius to help.

316
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,878
But not to take your place.

317
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:44,289
No one could ever replace you, Spike.

318
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:47,322
Not even when you are being a jealous numskull.

319
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:49,542
I'm sorry, Twilight.

320
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,430
I've never should have been so jealous.

321
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:53,916
And I'm sorry too, Spike.

322
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:55,739
I should have been more sensitive.

323
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:58,273
And Owloysius...

324
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,518
I know now that you weren't out to take my job.

325
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,014
Forgive me?

326
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:03,938
Hoo?

327
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,116
Me. Forgive me, Spike.

328
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:07,054
Hoo!

329
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,570
He forgives you, Spike.

330
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:15,406
Hey! How did you guys know where I was?

331
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,436
It was your ketchup covered feet.

332
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:21,120
Owloysius discovered your footprints and
we followed them all the way to the cave.

333
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,291
Oh yeah, the ketchup.

334
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:23,969
It looked pretty real though, didn't it?

335
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:27,005
Uh...

336
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:34,239
I know Princess Celestia will wanna
read about what happened today...

337
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:35,576
I'm ready when you are.

338
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:40,550
Hey, Spike. Why don't you
write to Princess Celestia?

339
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,430
And tell her what you've learned?

340
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:43,547
Really?

341
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:45,927
Why, that's a big responsibility!

342
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:47,093
I know.

343
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,942
But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.

344
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,975
"Dear Princess Celestia."

345
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,013
"This is Spike, writing to you
about my adventures."

346
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,685
"This week I've learned that being jealous..."

347
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,536
"...and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship."

348
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:05,860
"I also learned that there's plenty of love
for every friend to share."

349
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:09,364
"So from here on out,
I promise, that I, Spike, will..."

350
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,531
Oh, Spike.

351
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:18,509
Hoo?

352
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:21,669
Who? Spike! You kno...

353
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,308
Oooooh...

354
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:32,732
