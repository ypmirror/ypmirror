1
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,648
The timber wolves are a-howlin'!

2
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:17,694
The timber wolves are a-howlin'!

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,544
Eyup.

4
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:23,323
The Zap Apples are comin'!

5
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:25,300
The Zap Apples are comin'!

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,889
Yay!

7
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,794
The Zap Apples are comin'!

8
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:30,777
That's what I said.

12
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,377
Hey, silly goose!

13
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,764
Quit your gawkin' and move your caboose!

14
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:22,719
Ready, Granny!

15
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,245
Ready for what?

16
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:27,390
For makin' Zap Apple Jam!

17
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,671
Darn tootin'!

18
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:32,812
It's time for some good old-fashioned
Zap Apple Jammin'!

19
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,587
Yes mam, I can't wait mam!

20
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:38,112
Wait for what?

21
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,403
To make Zap Apple Jam with you!

22
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:41,446
Of course!

23
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:44,668
Now I been doing this
ever since I was a little pony.

24
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:48,903
So be warned, pickle pear,
there's a whole mess steps in this process

25
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,372
and you got to get
each one of them just right.

26
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:53,958
Or no Zap Apple Jam.

27
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:55,345
Take this.

28
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:59,380
Is this one of your gazillion secret herbal
ingredients for the Zap Apple Jam?

29
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:01,892
That there's a broom.

30
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:03,843
Now get sweepin', pipsqueak!

31
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:06,740
Now while you sweep, I'll get to...

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,224
Oh ponyfeathers!

33
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:14,232
Bet I'd forget my mane if
it wasn't attached to my head.

34
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,583
There's the Zap Apple leaves.

35
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:36,942
Right on schedule!

36
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:55,394
Well, howdy-doo there, Filthy Rich!

37
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:56,895
Hello, Mrs. Smith.

38
00:02:57,045 --> 00:03:01,109
Did I hear right that there's a
Zap Apple harvest coming in a few days?

39
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,486
Four days, to be exact.

40
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:04,971
Excellent news!

41
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:08,074
And as usual,
I get your first hundred jars?

42
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:09,560
'Course, Filthy.

43
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,263
I prefer Rich?

44
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:16,778
Oh, you poor, poor thing...

45
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:20,375
Having to make all that
Zap Apple Jam with Granny Smith.

46
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,759
Actually, I been looking forward to
making Zap Apple Jam for years!

47
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,513
I'm not talking about the jam,
I'm talking about Granny Smith!

48
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:33,754
You must be sooo embarassed.

49
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,531
What do ya mean?

50
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:42,119
You know, with all her silly ways,
how she forgets things,

51
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,043
and makes you wear
these ridiculous costumes?

52
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,930
Granny said that the water needs-

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,072
Thank goodness
you're here on the farm

54
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:52,156
and not in town where
everypony could see you.

55
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,710
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

56
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:56,726
"Silly ways"?

57
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,117
Thank you kindly, Filthy!

58
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,484
Shake a leg there, slowpoke!

59
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:09,778
We got a gaggle's worth of goods
to gather before the harvest.

60
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,137
Come on!

61
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:13,968
Gonna make Zap Apple Jam, oopsie ooh!

62
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:16,072
Gatherin' the goodies now, oopdie hee!

63
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:25,695
They don't make 'em like they used to.

64
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,246
Hey, you bite it, you buy it!

65
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:47,798
Why hello bees, Beatrice, Beecher!

66
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:51,219
You've all been busy little bees,
haven't you?

67
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,569
Granny, isn't there a less silly way
to get the honey?

68
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:05,947
Isn't this just precious?

69
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,385
Please stop!

70
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:11,214
And it is perfect for makin'
our Zap Apple Jam!

71
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:13,672
Stop it, Granny!

72
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,059
Granny, please!

73
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,424
Those ponies over there are watchin' me!

74
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:21,871
What? Are those fillies your friends?

75
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,710
Hello, Half-pint's friends!

76
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,968
Hi, Granny Smith!

77
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,590
Hi, Half-pint!

78
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:33,533
What dolls.

79
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:37,502
Why, when I was little,
ponies didn't come that purdy.

80
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:39,235
Are we done shopping, Granny?

81
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:41,589
'Cause I'd like to get back
to the farm, fast.

82
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,312
Hold on, snellybelly.

83
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,573
And by capturing
the whole sale market,

84
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:57,433
purchasing in bulk
and slashing all prices,

85
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,830
we undermine every other
gift market in town.

86
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,691
And that's how Rich's
Barnyard Bargains

87
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:06,863
became the cornerstone
of retail in Ponyville.

88
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,697
Well, thank you, Mr. Filthy-

89
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,604
I mean, Mr. Rich.

90
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:15,631
What a wonderful day of sharing!

91
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:19,432
And thank you for being a part of
Family Appreciation Day!

92
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,410
Now, let's see who will be
bringing in a family member

93
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,124
for next Monday's
Family Appreciation Day...

94
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:28,673
Apple Bloom!

95
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:32,738
But Miss Cheerilee,
Monday is Zap Apple harvest day!

96
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:36,365
And Applejack and Big Macintosh
will be too busy to come and speak.

97
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:39,618
Well, is there anypony else
in your family that could-

98
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,585
Miss Cheerilee!

99
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,729
Apple Bloom's Granny Smith
isn't working harvest...

100
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,778
She could come.

101
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,270
Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn't-

102
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,340
That's a splendid idea,
Diamond Tiara!

103
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,851
Apple Bloom, you shall bring in
Granny Smith on Monday.

104
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:59,481
Have a great weekend,
everypony!

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,478
Granny Smith?

106
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,037
Come Monday?

107
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:07,056
I'll be the laughing stock of Ponyville!

108
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:16,755
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom.

109
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,401
I already told you that we just
can't take a break from harvest

110
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:20,552
to come to your school.

111
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:22,502
You know what'll happen.

112
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:23,703
I know...

113
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:27,123
After the fifth day,
the Zap Apples disappear...

114
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:41,022
Look! The third sign!

115
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,428
Right on time!

116
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:45,678
Hot diggity!

117
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,129
Alright, you lazy daisies,
move your caboose!

118
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:05,474
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom,
but don't you fret.

119
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:09,202
Granny Smith's got no shortage
of entertainin' stories to tell.

120
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:12,191
I know. That's what
I'm worried about...

121
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,124
I'll be embarrassed,

122
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:18,342
shamed,

123
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:19,530
disgraced,

124
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,688
mortified,

125
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:21,998
humiliate-

126
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,221
What are you, a dictionary?

127
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,780
Snap out of it,
we're here to help you!

128
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,847
After all, we are
the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

129
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:32,558
We'll figure out a way
to postpone your presentation.

130
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:34,853
But how?

131
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,940
All this worry is makin' me sick!

132
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:40,983
Sick?

133
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:43,868
That's it!

134
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,416
C'mon!

135
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:49,424
Ten-hut!

136
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,250
Now listen here, troops!

137
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,950
I don't want any whinin', or cryin',
or crackin' under pressure!

138
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,086
Do I make myself clear?

139
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:02,948
Court-martial!

140
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:11,058
Stay still, Apple Bloom!
You have to look sick!

141
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:17,645
Hey, this is hot!

142
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:20,606
What in the hayseed is going on
in there, silly billy?

143
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,127
Oh, Granny Smith!

144
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:28,058
We were just about to come get you!

145
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,655
Apple Bloom's sick!

146
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:33,066
Looks like she may have
to stay home all week!

147
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,680
Perfect as a Piccadilly pear!

148
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:43,078
Now what?

149
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:47,175
It's already almost sundown!

150
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,926
Tomorrow is Sunday

151
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,626
and I only have one more day
to figure something out!

152
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,181
Hey! Look!

153
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,200
That's the fourth sign!

154
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:13,635
The Zap Apples have appeared!

155
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:16,194
And that gives me an idea!

156
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:28,674
We can't move Family Appreciation Day,
so let's move harvest day instead!

157
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:31,511
They don't look... quite ripe.

158
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:33,858
Harvesting apples early
never hurt an apple.

159
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:34,940
I don't know...

160
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,351
Zap Apple trees aren't like
normal apple trees.

161
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:39,685
They're magic.

162
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,813
How different can they be?

163
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:51,781
Well if we can't buck 'em,
let's just pick 'em!

164
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,492
Any other bright ideas?

165
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:16,430
Granny Smith,

166
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,069
it's Miss Cheerilee!

167
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,209
Apple Bloom said you wanted
to speak with me?

168
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:25,439
Hello?

169
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:26,607
Granny Smi-

170
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:30,736
Well hello there! Howdydoo!

171
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:33,490
Hi... Granny Smith.

172
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,616
Is everything okay?

173
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:38,953
Of course it is!
Why wouldn't it be?

174
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:47,263
Excuse me.

175
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:49,955
Pickles always give me the hiccups!

176
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:58,649
I need to tell you that I can't make
the presentation on Monday after all!

177
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,294
Oh no, is that so?

178
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,278
No doubts about it!

179
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:06,981
I gotta shear the flowers
and water the sheep!

180
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:08,149
I mean...

181
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,402
I have to water the flowers
and shear the sheep!

182
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,465
That's too bad.

183
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:14,906
We can reschedule.

184
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,191
Where am I?

185
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:24,040
Well howdy, Miss Cheerilee!

186
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,872
You window shopping?

187
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:30,005
No, you asked me to come here

188
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,300
to tell me that you wouldn't be making it
to Family Appreciation Day?

189
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,651
Fiddlesticks!

190
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:39,221
I wouldn't miss it
for all the tea in Canterlot!

191
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,381
But, didn't you just say...

192
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,569
See you Monday!

193
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:52,165
I can't believe she woke up
from her nap.

194
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:55,239
She never wakes up from her nap!

195
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,597
I wish I could just run off and hide!

196
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:01,989
Well, you can't run off...

197
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:05,433
But maybe somepony else can!

198
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:33,692
The Zap Apple harvest has begun!

199
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:39,615
And tomorrow we'll be making up
some Zap Apple Jam!

200
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:43,322
Miss Granny Smith?
Telegram.

201
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,456
Well, bust my buttons.

202
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:50,751
Uncle Apple Strudel wants me
to pay him a visit.

203
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,922
And you can just make the 8am train.

204
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:54,612
I already packed you a bag!

205
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:56,882
Well that was considerate.

206
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:58,868
But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet!

207
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:01,762
I'll be back in time to make that jam!

208
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:05,418
That train ride takes all day.

209
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:06,911
I'm safe.

210
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,855
For today's Family Appreciation Day,

211
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,590
we are pleased
to welcome Granny Smith.

212
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:18,645
Apple Bloom?
Is Granny Smith here?

213
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:21,518
I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee,

214
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:26,017
but she got called out of town
on account of a family emergency...

215
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,882
Well howdy, my little ponies!

216
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,353
Howdy, y'all!

217
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:39,940
I'm as happy as a pig
in a fresh mudpile to be here!

218
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:43,778
What are you doing here?

219
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,367
Did you miss the train?

220
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,490
No, it came.

221
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,540
And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it.

222
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,788
Ooooooh, noogie noogie noggie!

223
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:58,701
I can't wait to hear
Granny Smith's presentation...

224
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,700
If she can remember any of it.

225
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:08,302
Long ago, when I was a little pony,

226
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:12,874
things were very different
here in Ponyville.

227
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:17,508
'Cause there was no Ponyville!

228
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:21,107
<i>That's right, my little ponies.</i>

229
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:25,861
<i>Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk
back when I was a little filly.</i>

230
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:28,322
<i>We ventured far and wide,</i>

231
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:30,712
<i>collecting new seeds
and sellin' them on.</i>

232
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:35,454
<i>But my pa was the finest seed collector
in all of Equestria.</i>

233
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:40,033
<i>Then, one day, the Smith family
found themselves in the most brilliant,</i>

234
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:43,364
<i>most grand, most magnificent
of all cities.</i>

235
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:45,321
<i>A place called...</i>

236
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,479
<i>Canterlot.</i>

237
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:49,977
<i>Why, I bet your hooves to hindquarters that</i>

238
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:52,952
<i>I had never seen anything like it
before nor since.</i>

239
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:56,433
<i>And as if the beauty of
that city wasn't enough,</i>

240
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,036
<i>suddenly, she appeared.</i>

241
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:00,688
<i>Princess Celestia.</i>

242
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:03,412
<i>The most regal of all ponies.</i>

243
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,293
<i>When lo and behold,</i>

244
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:09,738
<i>she stopped and look at
my pa's seed collection.</i>

245
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:13,078
<i>Then Princess Celestia saw that
we were plumb-tuckered</i>

246
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,494
<i>and hankerin' to find
our forever home.</i>

247
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:17,945
<i>And bein' a royal Princess and all,</i>

248
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:22,005
<i>she knew exactly the place for us
to lay down our stakes.</i>

249
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:25,045
<i>My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks.</i>

250
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:29,728
<i>We quickly found that land
near the Everfree Forest,</i>

251
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:32,178
<i>and we built our first home.</i>

252
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:34,602
<i>Next, we planted our first orchards.</i>

253
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:37,391
<i>But an orchard don't grow overnight,</i>

254
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,186
<i>and we were getting
mighty short on food.</i>

255
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:46,222
<i>Now mind you, we were
cautioned about the forest,</i>

256
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,527
<i>and we knew that
it was not fit to enter.</i>

257
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,628
<i>But I knew there was
critters livin' there,</i>

258
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,972
<i>so there must be somethin' to eat.</i>

259
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:56,934
<i>It was dark and musty,</i>

260
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,587
<i>and I won't lie, it was scary.</i>

261
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:02,625
<i>But every inch was covered in plant life.</i>

262
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,710
<i>And before I knew it,
wasn't I standin'</i>

263
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,212
<i>in front of the most incredible...</i>

264
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,585
<i>apple trees!</i>

265
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:15,095
<i>I had never seen anything before
this kind of colorful fruit!</i>

266
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:18,355
<i>I started picking apples,
quick as a whip!</i>

267
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:31,695
<i>I turned, and there before me stood...</i>

268
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,884
<i>the timber wolves!</i>

269
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:39,411
<i>I'd never run so fast in my life.</i>

270
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:43,332
<i>I did the only thing I could think of.</i>

271
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:59,765
<i>My pa and I planted
those special apple seeds</i>

272
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:02,434
<i>and before our eyes
they grew like wildfire.</i>

273
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:09,241
<i>Well, we had full grown trees faster
than you could say lickety split.</i>

274
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:12,557
<i>Then each year,
I paid close attention to</i>

275
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:15,489
<i>the signs of the Zap Apple
special harvesting times.</i>

276
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:18,158
<i>How the weather affects
the Everfree Forest,</i>

277
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:22,094
<i>how the timber wolves howl when
the Zap Apples first start growing,</i>

278
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:25,958
<i>and how they zapped away if
you didn't pick 'em all in one day!</i>

279
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:30,296
<i>And the fruits of our labor were
the best fruit we ever tasted.</i>

280
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:34,008
<i>Soon enough I was mixing up
batches of Zap Apple Jam.</i>

281
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:37,259
<i>Just like harvestin' the Zap Apples
had its special rules,</i>

282
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,118
<i>so did makin' Zap Apple Jam!</i>

283
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:43,352
<i>I learned that you gotta be
extra friendly with the bees,</i>

284
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:47,701
<i>otherwise their honey won't taste rightly
sweet to mix in with the Zap Apples.</i>

285
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:51,854
<i>Who'd'a thought that glass jars
needed talking to?</i>

286
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:56,447
<i>Or that Zap Apples
like pink polka dots?</i>

287
00:18:56,597 --> 00:19:00,026
<i>But magic is as magic does.
Just funny that way.</i>

288
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:03,871
<i>Then ponies started comin' to
our farm from far and wide,</i>

289
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:06,413
<i>just to get a taste
of my Zap Apple Jam.</i>

290
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,097
<i>Some of them decided to stay,
like Stinkin' Rich,</i>

291
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,211
<i>Diamond Tiara's great grandfather.</i>

292
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,495
<i>Matter of fact,
the first thing he ever sold</i>

293
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,532
<i>was my Zap Apple Jam.</i>

294
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,588
<i>And before we knew it,
we had ourselves a nice little town.</i>

295
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:23,049
<i>Bustling with all kinds of ponies.</i>

296
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:28,570
<i>And that is how Ponyville was founded.</i>

297
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,571
Thank you kindly, little ponies.

298
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:48,582
Now now, let's settle down.

299
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:50,927
So if it weren't for you
and the Zap Apples,

300
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:52,700
Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!

301
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:54,546
Darn tootin', little filly!

302
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:56,700
If it weren't for my Granny Smith,

303
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,538
your daddy wouldn't have
Barnyard Bargains.

304
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:04,765
But-

305
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:10,498
But she's just a... kooky old lady!

306
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:13,690
She is not a kooky old lady!

307
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,111
She is the most amazing pony
in all of Ponyville!

308
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:39,967
I think this is the best
Zap Apple Jam I've tasted yet!

309
00:20:40,117 --> 00:20:43,596
Must because YOU had something
to do with it, Apple Bloom.

310
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:45,233
You betcha.

311
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:49,098
Apple Bloom is one humdinger
of a Zap Apple Jammer!

312
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,445
I am?

313
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:53,714
So I take it
Family Appreciation Day went well?

314
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:57,612
Did it? My Granny Smith
is super special!

315
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,083
I just forgot that for a little while.

316
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,474
Aw, don't fret.
I forget things all the time.

317
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:06,613
Now, I'll getcha...

318
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:09,274
