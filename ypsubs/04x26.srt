1
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:05,711
What's wrong, Twilight?

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,736
<i>It doesn't seem that my</i>
<i>new role as a Princess</i>

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,969
<i>equates to all that much.</i>

4
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:16,846
I am Tirek! And I will take what
should've been mine long ago!

5
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:20,392
With each passing moment, he
grows stronger still.

6
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:23,151
And I know just the princess
who can stop him.

7
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:25,662
I'm afraid I must call in
another to stop Tirek.

8
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,493
Oh ho! You're talking
about me I presume.

9
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:31,313
Haven't you girls just
learned so much!

10
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:33,276
And there's something
interesting about the sections

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,400
that Discord bookmarked.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,663
Each of you received
something from the pony

13
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:38,083
whose life you helped change.

14
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:41,683
There's still one key
missing: my element.

15
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:46,429
Join me, Discord and
reclaim your greatness.

16
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,934
<i>Discord has betrayed</i>
<i>the ponies of Equestria</i>

17
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,059
<i>and joined forces with Tirek.</i>

18
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:54,515
<i>There is no doubt that Tirek</i>
<i>is after Alicorn magic.</i>

19
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:57,521
We must rid ourselves
of our magic

20
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:00,349
before Tirek has the chance
to steal it from us.

21
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:12,360
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
See you next season for more <s>muffins</s> ponies!</i>

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,696
<i>Tirek is set on</i>
<i>possessing Alicorn magic.</i>

23
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:46,064
When he comes for us, we cannot
have what he is looking for.

24
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:50,171
I'm more than willing to do
my part and give up my magic.

25
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:51,590
<i>You misunderstand.</i>

26
00:01:51,797 --> 00:01:54,495
Our magic cannot just
disappear into thin air.

27
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:56,640
Somepony must keep it safe.

28
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,356
That somepony is
you, Twilight.

29
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,616
Why me?

30
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,942
We do not believe
that Tirek is aware

31
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,902
that a fourth Alicorn Princess
exists in Equestria.

32
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,904
If we transfer our
magic to you,

33
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,122
Tirek will not know
where it has gone.

34
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,454
Do you understand what
we're asking of you?

35
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,776
Yes. It's just I'm only now
learning how to control

36
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:19,494
my own Alicorn magic. To
take on even more...

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,602
Twilight, you represent
the Element of Magic.

38
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,810
If there is anypony who
can do this, it's you.

39
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,359
Taking on this task will be one
of the most difficult things

40
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:31,342
I will ever do.

41
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,090
But with the help
of my friends...

42
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,977
I'm sorry, Princess Twilight,

43
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:37,736
but you must keep your
new abilities a secret.

44
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:40,839
I fear that your friends being
aware of your new power

45
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,946
could put them at great risk.

46
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:45,949
Do you still think you can
take on this responsibility?

47
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:49,633
This is the role I am meant to
play as a Princess of Equestria.

48
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,855
I will not
fail to do my duty!

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,974
Then we must begin at once.

50
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:19,568
That can't be right.

51
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:21,137
What can't be right?

52
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:23,582
Nothing. Carry on.

53
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,002
It is done.

54
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:58,782
You weren't gone very long.

55
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:00,948
Does that mean
everything's OK?

56
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:03,229
Yup. Everything's fine.

57
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:04,472
Heh heh!

58
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,771
In that case, I'm
going back to bed.

59
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,782
Sun's not up, then
neither am I.

60
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:13,955
That's strange; the sun
should be up by now.

61
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:16,575
The sun should be up by now!

62
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:20,288
You can do this.

63
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:45,278
Shining Armor. Why, whatever
are you doing here?

64
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:47,319
Back off, traitor.

65
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,546
<i>The only one Discord</i>
<i>betrayed was himself.</i>

66
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,662
Abandoning his true nature
to make "friends"

67
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:58,622
with weak-minded equines
who offer him nothing.

68
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:13,635
How could you do this?

69
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:18,620
Why don't you go and
have a little fun?

70
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:21,424
I won't stand in
your way.

71
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,118
What have you done?

72
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,605
WHERE IS YOUR MAGIC?

73
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:53,609
I have to gain better control.

74
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,192
I sure can't practice here.

75
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,268
Twilight? Where are we going?

76
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,227
Oh, uh, hi, Spike.

77
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:03,943
Gotta go...somewhere else.

78
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,522
Whoa!

79
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,142
Whoa!

80
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:11,828
Twilight?

81
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,649
Oh my goodness. Are
you all right?

82
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,671
Jumpin' june bugs,
Twilight.

83
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,565
When did you learn
to fly that fast?

84
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:30,485
I must've caught a particularly
strong breeze...

85
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:32,054
or something.

86
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:34,234
Must've been "or something"

87
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,489
because there wasn't
any breeze up there.

88
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:37,990
I don't know what happened.

89
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,433
But I don't really have time
to figure it out right now.

90
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,450
Another visit to the Castle of
the Two Sisters, I presume?

91
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,848
We'd be more than
happy to accompany you.

92
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:47,781
Not today.

93
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:49,992
Tirek may still be a threat.

94
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,801
I need you all to stay here
and encourage everypony

95
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,998
to remain inside.

96
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:06,593
Getting rid of your magic so
that I cannot take it from you?

97
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,249
That was your plan?

98
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,648
How does it feel?

99
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,252
Knowing that soon
every Pegasus, Unicorn,

100
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,863
and Earth Pony will
bow to my will

101
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:21,159
and that there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

102
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,344
You will not prevail, Tirek.

103
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:27,192
Give my regards to Cerberus.

104
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:34,883
<i>You meant,our will,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>

105
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,133
Of course.

106
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,840
Here. I want you to
have something.

107
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:43,108
This was given to me by
someone very close to me.

108
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,579
I give it to you as a sign
of my gratitude and loyalty.

109
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:50,169
Oh my! I do love
a good accessory.

110
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:52,651
I suppose that's
Rarity's influence.

111
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:58,517
Amusing. But we have no
time for such things.

112
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,694
With the Princesses out of
the way we can now--

113
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,889
Is this meant to be humorous?

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,042
Oh no!

115
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:07,514
I haven't touched that one yet.

116
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:09,145
There is a fourth?

117
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,168
And you did not
tell me this?

118
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:12,862
I just needed some assurance

119
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:15,951
that you truly considered
this a team effort.

120
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,042
And now I have it.

121
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:21,539
Then where can we find
this fourth princess?

122
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,047
Where is her castle?

123
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:25,923
Castle? Oh. No.

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,650
Princess Twilight lives
above a library in Ponyville.

125
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,836
Castle. Ha ha!

126
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:35,578
Not for much longer.

127
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:43,527
<i>All right, y'all,</i>

128
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,169
<i>I think we've warned</i>
<i>everypony to stay inside.</i>

129
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:48,725
I'm sure Discord
will catch Tirek

130
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,626
and this will all be over soon.

131
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:53,756
I'll bet he takes
his sweet time.

132
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:56,739
<i>Or perhaps these things</i>
<i>just take time.</i>

133
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:58,171
You're back!

134
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,199
Did you bring the
cucumber sandwiches?

135
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,075
I did!

136
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:05,826
I imagine they'll be your last
decent meal for quite some time.

137
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:12,316
Ta-da!

138
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:13,828
You've gathered up all of them?

139
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:16,468
And her little dragon, too.

140
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:19,006
Why are you doing this?

141
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:20,864
I thought we were friends.

142
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,323
Oh, we were.

143
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:25,590
But Tirek offered me so much
more than just tea parties.

144
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,332
Surely you saw this coming.

145
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:30,481
I didn't. I really didn't.

146
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,000
You really think she'd
do anything for them?

147
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:52,171
If Twilight has magic to
give, it will be yours.

148
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,654
Soon there won't be a Pegasus,
Earth Pony, or Unicorn

149
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,227
who will be able to
stand up against us.

150
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:03,533
Us? Who said
anything about us?

151
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:04,386
You did.

152
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,580
You've helped me grow strong.

153
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,333
You've provided the means
by which I can obtain

154
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,154
Princess Twilight's magic.

155
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:15,252
And now you are no
longer of any use to me.

156
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,939
But you said this was a sign
of your gratitude and loyalty.

157
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:32,686
A gift from someone
close to you.

158
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:35,322
My brother who betrayed me.

159
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,200
It is as worthless as he is.

160
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,840
Surely you saw this coming.

161
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:46,398
I didn't. I truly didn't.

162
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:53,525
I can do this.

163
00:10:58,403 --> 00:11:01,086
See? Ha! Perfectly
controlled teleportation!

164
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,767
<i>PRINCESS TWILIGHT!</i>

165
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,155
Tirek!

166
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:14,497
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO ME!

167
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,519
You're going to
give me what I want.

168
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:44,064
No!

169
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,164
Now I understand what your
fellow princesses have done.

170
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,757
It appears we are
at an impasse.

171
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:37,658
How about a trade,
Princess Twilight?

172
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,074
Their release for all the
Alicorn magic in Equestria.

173
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:52,349
What's it going to
be, Princess?

174
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:58,204
Don't do it, Twilight!

175
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,071
We aren't worth it.

176
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:01,838
<i>Oh, but you are,</i>
<i>Fluttershy.</i>

177
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:05,605
You're the pony who taught
me that Friendship is Magic.

178
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:10,366
I had magic and friendship,
and now I don't have either.

179
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:14,753
Enough! I want an answer.
And I want it now!

180
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:31,933
I will give you my magic,
in exchange for my friends.

181
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:36,005
As you wish.

182
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,981
All of my friends.

183
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,400
After the way he
has betrayed you,

184
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,330
you still call him a "friend"?

185
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:51,820
Release him!

186
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,037
If that's what you want.

187
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,527
Thank you, Twilight.

188
00:14:58,616 --> 00:14:59,418
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:00,792
I know.

190
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,320
Your turn.

191
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,938
Twilight, what
were you thinking?

192
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,873
Tirek tricked me into believing
that he could offer me something

193
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:35,580
more valuable than friendship.

194
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:39,459
But there is nothing worth
more. I see that now.

195
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:42,663
He lied when he said that
this medallion was given

196
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:45,038
as a sign of gratitude
and loyalty.

197
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:48,961
But when I say that it is a
sign of our true friendship,

198
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,138
I am telling the truth.

199
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,202
You think that might
be the last one we need?

200
00:15:58,493 --> 00:15:59,921
We have to get to the chest.

201
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,118
Together!

202
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:25,291
I think we have to
do this together.

203
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,517
How is this possible?
You have no magic!

204
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:21,972
You're wrong, Tirek!

205
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,351
I may have given you
my Alicorn magic,

206
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,857
but I carry within me the
most powerful magic of all!

207
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,892
Sweet Celestia! Are you all
seeing what I'm seeing?

208
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,802
<i>But whose is it?</i>

209
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,995
I believe it is yours,
Princess Twilight.

210
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:20,852
You've been wondering what you
are meant to do as a Princess.

211
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:22,509
Do you know now?

212
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:26,130
As Princess, I believe I
have the power to spread

213
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:28,470
<i>the Magic of Friendship</i>
<i>across Equestria.</i>

214
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:30,835
<i>That is the role I am meant</i>
<i>to have in our world.</i>

215
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:33,139
The role I choose to have.

216
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:35,880
But I didn't defeat
Tirek on my own.

217
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:38,081
It took all of us
to unlock the chest.

218
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,880
Then it is unlikely
you are meant

219
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,830
to take on this
task alone.

220
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,986
Oooh! Wow!

221
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,394
<i>You are now Twilight Sparkle,</i>
<i>the Princess of Friendship.</i>

222
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,112
But what is the Princess of
Friendship without her friends?

223
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:09,274
Wait a minute.
Where's my throne?

224
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,896
I don't think you're
quite there yet.

225
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:15,024
Yes, well, I suppose not.
