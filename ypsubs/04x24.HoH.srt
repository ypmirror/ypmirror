really were wonderful.

167
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,366
But does anypony know what
was going on with Spike?

168
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,028
He sure seemed to be havin'
a tough time of it out there.

169
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,225
He put things right
in time, though.

170
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,948
Actually, it was me.

171
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,041
I didn't want him
to be embarrassed,

172
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,693
so I cast a secret spell
to light it for him.

173
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:05,289
Oh dear. Have you
told him?

174
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,943
No, but he might have
figured it out on his own.

175
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,113
You gotta tell him just in case.

176
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,899
I know. I'm just afraid
of how he'll take it.

177
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,190
I know what pride he
takes in a job well done.

178
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,720
Psst. Here he
comes now.

179
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:18,378
Act casual.

180
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:21,153
'Sup.

181
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,115
Spike! Is everything OK?

182
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,234
I guess. I don't know!

183
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:28,109
The weirdest thing
happened down there.

184
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,302
Yeah, about that. I--

185
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:32,474
I mean, there I was,
trying to light the torch,

186
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,019
with all of Equestria watching,

187
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:36,314
and feeling like the
hugest failure ever.

188
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,188
And then the thing just
lit. It was amazing!

189
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,378
Oh! Phew! I was afraid
you'd be upset.

190
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:46,037
Upset? Are you kidding? Why
would I be upset to discover

191
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,239
I can light fire with my mind?

192

Better be careful with that.
Might burst into flames later.

Delayed reaction.

210

Hey Twi, what is it?

211
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:39,623
Hold on, hold on!
Give me a second.

212

If I can set fire to
stuff with my mind,

just around the corner,

are about to ask me

to set fire to something
with my mind!

216
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,476
No. Because you can't.

217

Oh really? So how do you explain
what happened down there

in front of thousands
and thousands--

219
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:02,429
I did it, Spike. I cast a
spell to do it for you.

220
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:06,372
... in front of thousands
and thousands...

221

I'm sorry, Spike.

222

I just couldn't stand to
see you stuck like that.

223
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:12,913
You understand, don't you?

224
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:17,317
I, uh...I need to be
alone right now.

225
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:18,864
Spike?

the medal count.

00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,559
Actually I was
looking for Spike.

332
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:50,558
Have you seen him?

333
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:51,715
He wouldn't come.

334
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,336
We tried to talk him into it.

But he wouldn't listen.

336

Forgive me for
being blunt, Spike,
