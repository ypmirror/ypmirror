harder than I thought.

356
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,860
We'll have to try again.

357
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,400
Hey, Twilight.

358
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,460
I don't want to live in
that awful future we saw.

359
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,880
I don't think you'll have to.

360
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,960
[clank]

361
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,180
Twilight: Pinkie? Fluttershy?

362
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,700
SILENCE, CHANGELING!

363
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,980
All servants of Queen
Chrysalis found in these woods

364
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,640
must be destroyed!

365
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,480
[gulp]
