1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,620
We're so happy you
could come have lunch

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,660
with your father
and me, Fluttershy.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,560
I'm so glad you asked.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,040
And it was super awesome
of you to invite me too.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,640
Things have been so busy
with the Wonderbolts lately;

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,740
it's great to get a chance
to relax someplace quiet.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,960
That's exactly what I intend
to do now that I've retired.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,960
In fact, I converted
the back house

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,660
to showcase my
cloud collection.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,200
I have my clouds; your
mom has her flowers;

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,600
you've got your animals
and your brother...

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,100
Zephyr Breeze has
his... interests.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,980
I'll say. Remember when he
was convinced square clouds

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,700
were gonna be the next
big thing? [snort]

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,240
He's matured a
lot since then.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,200
Actually, it's funny
you bring Zephyr up.

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,700
Oh, no! Not again.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,460
It's just for a
little while, dear.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
Till he gets back
on his hooves.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,360
Wait. You don't mean?

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,200
Guess who's home?

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,660
That's right, big sis,
it's your one and only,

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,660
favorite little
brother... moi!

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,980
Awww.

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,360
Hi, Flutter-butter!

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,580
How's the bestest
big sister ever?

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,200
Hey, where's the love?

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,540
How about a little excitement
to see your baby brother?

31
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,980
I'm just surprised.

32
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,220
When you left, you said mane
therapy was your calling.

33
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,560
Oh, it is, sis. It is. You would
not believe how much stress

34
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,380
ponies hold in
their manes.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,130
Everything gets limp
and unmanageable.

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,020
No offense, but brushing alone
won't solve the problem.

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,560
What went wrong?

38
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
Nothing went wrong
per se.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,820
It's just "the powers that
be" were so locked into their

40
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,620
"required styles"
and you know me.

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
I've got my own style
and I think they were

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,860
a little threatened.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,650
Oh, this is lovely, dear.

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,060
Ugh.

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,400
Well, if it isn't Rainbows "the
best flier that ever was" Dash.

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,760
Oh, this ought be good.

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,100
Sorry, I shouldn't
tease ya.

48
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,260
I know the whole "super awesome
flyer" bit's just to impress me.

49
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,060
[gasp]

50
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,360
Still, thanks for showing up for
my homecoming, it's, it's sweet.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,140
[gasp]

52
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,400
I kinda thought there'd
be more ponies here.

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,120
I mean, what about your party
planner friend? Sprinkle Pie?

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,940
She coulda turned this into a
real house par-tay, am I right?

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,900
I mean, this place
could use it.

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800

57
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,980
I, I ...

58
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,240
We have been meaning
to redecorate.

59
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,800
Dad, please, when I get all my
stuff back in here, you won't

60
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,260
even remember what this
boring old place looked like.

61
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,220
Um, Mom, Dad? Can I talk
to you for a second?

62
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,400
What is it, honey?

63
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,780
I'm not so sure letting Zephyr
move back home is a good idea.

64
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,320
I know you both
want to help,

65
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,200
but don't you
remember last time?

66
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,440
Zephyr's just trying to
find his place, dear.

67
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,200
I know. It just seems like
his place always ends up

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,430
being your place.

69
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,180
And then he sort of makes
you do everything for him.

70
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,680
Well, we may not be as
bold as you, Fluttershy,

71
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,040
but don't you worry. We know
how to stand up for ourselves.

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,760
And they were all like, "We
love your free spirit, Zeph

73
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,000
and it would be wrong to cage
that. Go follow your dreams."

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,740
[thud]

75
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,700
Zeph was just telling me
all about the ins and outs

76
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,660
of Mane Therapy School.

77
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,430
It's all so political. I
just could not take it.

78
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,120
Well, maybe if you stuck with
it for more than a few weeks?

79
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,840
Sorry, sis, but when
something's not the right fit,

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
this pony's gotta fly!

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
Anyway, good talk, Rainbows.

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,720
I am so touched you
came to see me, really,

83
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,700
I hate to deprive
you of my presence,

84
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,920
but this Breeze needs his Zs.

85
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,900
You know it's the middle
of the day, right?

86
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I know. SIESTA!

87
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,420
I'm just gonna assume
you made up my room

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,660
the way I like
it, right, Mom?

89
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,420
Ooh, I almost forgot. All
my stuff is out front.

90
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,720
Wanna grab that for
me, Pops? Thanks!

91
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,600
[sigh] Same old "Zeph."

92
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,560
I know you weren't expecting
to see your brother,

93
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,880
but you've been kinda
quiet. Even for you.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm sorry, but I am just
so... so peeved right now!

95
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,900
[gasp]

96
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,060
Excuse my language.

97
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,120
Rainbow Dash! Fluttershy! It's
me, Pinkie Pie! Your friend!

98
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,300
[whistle]

99
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,600
Oh, um, sorry about that.

100
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,060
We just had lunch with
Fluttershy's parents

101
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,340
and you'll never
guess who showed up.

102
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,060
Ooh, Mayor Mare? Cranky Doodle
Donkey? Cheese Sandwich?

103
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,260
Miss Harshwhinny?

104
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
Zephyr Breeze.

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,180
Oh, that makes more sense.

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,860
And from the look
on your face,

107
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,980
I'm guessing it's for another
one of his 'extended' stays.

108
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
She's a bit peeved.

109
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,160
Zephyr is my brother
and I love him,

110
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,700
but he's never learned to
do anything for himself

111
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,820
and I don't know why my
parents keep letting him

112
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,100
trot all over them.

113
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,700
Well, if your parents won't
stand up for themselves,

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,920
maybe you need to
stand up for them.

115
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,580
You know, you're right.

116
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,440
[clatter]

117
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,540
[gasp]

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,500
[crash]

119
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,990
Zephyr Breeze!

120
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,400
Oh, hey sis! Come to see me work
my magic and turn this place

121
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,580
from drab to fab, huh?
Well, watch and learn!

122
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,020
Can't you see what
you're doing?

123
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,040
Yeah, I'm getting
rid of this old stuff

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,680
so I can turn the back
house into my art studio.

125
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,560
I've decided I'm going
to be a sculptor!

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm talking about
Mom's flowers.

127
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,660
She's gonna move them so I can
have my meditation patio here.

128
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,420
She loves replanting
stuff, don't you, Mom?

129
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,060
And Dad's been collecting
his favorite bits of cloud

130
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,480
from the factory since
before you were born.

131
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,260
The very best from
every production run

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,030
since my first day
on the job.

133
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,580
[smashing glass]

134
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,120
But why hold onto
the past, really?

135
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,940
You can't just fly in
and change everything

136
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,480
Mom and Dad have
built here.

137
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,520
But this is the only
place big enough

138
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,860
for my studio/meditation
garden.

139
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,980
Ooh, unless I do it
in the living room!

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,490
I know speaking up for yourself
can be hard, believe me.

141
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,920
But Zephyr will never stand on
his own if he can lean on you.

142
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
Don't be so
dramatic, sis.

143
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,480
Mom and Dad just want
to let me be me, right?

144
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,840
I can do plenty on my own.

145
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,900
I agree. Which is why
you should move out.

146
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,280
Oh. Well, I mean,
I totally would.

147
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,680
But I don't think that's
what Mom and Dad want.

148
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,380
It's not, is it?

149
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,420
Uh...

150
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,560
You know we love you, son.
But your sister has a point.

151
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,840
Sure. I mean, I really
just came back here to keep

152
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,200
you guys company. But
whatever's best for the family.

153
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,320
I just...I just gotta
grab a few essentials.

154
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,660
And you definitely have
somewhere else to go?

155
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,620
Of course! There's plenty
of ponies who'd love

156
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,860
for a little Breeze
to blow their way.

157
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,140
So, where's Zeph
gonna go now?

158
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,620
I'm not sure. Oh, I hope
I did the right thing.

159
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,380
Are you kidding?
One hundred percent!

160
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,580
Hey sis, your new
roomie's here!

161
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,580
OK, maybe like
seventy percent.

162
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,950
Um, Zephyr?

163
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,480
When Mom and Dad told you to
find someplace else to live,

164
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,160
I don't think
they meant here.

165
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
Well, it's not
their house,

166
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,360
so by definition
it's someplace else.

167
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,800
Am I right, Rainbows? Stop
oogling me and help settle this.

168
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,800
You know what? I totally
forgot that I promised

169
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,700
to help Pinkie Pie...
sprinkle... something.

170
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,720
You said you had
plenty of places to go.

171

Totally. Anything.

175
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,800
You have to get a job.

176
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,040
Crackin' the whip, huh? You
always were kinda bossy.

we going so early?

You have no idea how bad
morning sun is for your mane.

Remember how we talked
about you getting a job?

183
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,960
It was just yesterday. And
it's totally on my to-do list.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,960
But you can't expect
me to find something

185
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,480
befitting my
awesomeness overnight.

186
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,180
I thought you might
say that.

[knock knock]

188
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,200
So I did it for you.

What?

190
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,120
These fabrics all need
to be dyed those colors.

191
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,560
Do you think you
can handle that?

192
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,280
Um...I don't know.

Thanks for giving
my brother a job.

I just hope he's
up to the task.

200
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,320
Oh darling, dyeing fabric
is the simplest thing.

201
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,740
You just dip cloth

What did you do?

206
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,160
Since you talk to
animals all the time,

207
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,620
I just figured it
runs in the family,

208
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,580
so why not outsource
this stuff, you know?

209
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,680
Turns out the animal
communication thing

210
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,540
isn't genetic.

211
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,995
Zephyr! I asked
you to do this job,

212
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,840
not to pawn it off on
innocent woodland creatures.

213
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,640
OK. I guess you have some
feelings about this,

214
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,160
but you should know it's
basically your cat's fault

215
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,270
for walking by and
giving me the idea.

216
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,580
But I'm actually
kinda into this look.

is... you're welcome.

Wha-- Oh, uggh.

219
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,260
Zephyr, this is
just unacceptable!

220
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,460
Wow. I guess I know when my

You said you were taking me
to tea with the princess.

Don't worry, Zephyr.
It'll be easy.

I just need a Pegasus pony to

you said, it was easy.

You were supposed to supervise,
not do all the work.

240
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,960
I was supervising! And
then Zephyr asked me about

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,080
different cleaning techniques
and which one was best

242
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,880
and if I could--

243
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,080
Hey! I did all
the work.

244
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,940
Don't let him fool you, ol'
Spike is quite the taskmaster.

Oh, come on, sis.

You didn't do it at all!

won't be any fooling around

up with some excuse

me, Rainbows.

I supposed to do?

Keep trying? Finish
something for once?

269
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,600
Maybe that way, you'd actually
find something you like to do.

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,340
That all sounds fine for your
friends, but it's just not me.

Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I
don't think you can live here.

Fine. I'll just go
live in the woods

Zephyr can count on is his own.

Aww cheer up, Fluttershy.

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,920
I know it was hard, but
you did the right thing.

277
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,780
You couldn't let Zephyr
pull the same stuff on you

pulled on your folks.

UGH! I can't do this.
I can't do anything.

301
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,440
Zephyr, you're
smart and talented.

302
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,300
You could do anything
if you just tried.

303
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,180
And what if I give everything
I have and still fail?

304
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,960
Honestly, I think it's
better not to try at all.

305
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,740
But then you won't
ever do anything.

306
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,640
I don't expect you
two to understand.

307
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
I mean, when have
you ever failed?

308
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,180
You've literally helped save
Equestria, like, a dozen times.

309
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,550
And I was worried that
I'd fail every time.

310
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,460
Sometimes you have to do things
even though you might fail.

311

But failing is the worst!

312
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,760
And quitting doesn't feel
much better, does it?
No.

313
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,720
So here's the deal: You
can come back with me,

314
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,200
but you have to do exactly
what I say, no exceptions.

anything you ask me

have to stay here.

have to do, right?

352
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,560
I did it. I actually finished
something. By myself.

353
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,940
And it looks exactly
like it's supposed to.

354
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,220
I knew you could do
it, Zephyr.

355
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,140
I didn't!

356
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,100
But I do now. Thanks, for
believing in me, sis.

357
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,300
That's what big
sisters are for.

358
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,300
So, Zeph, now that you've
accomplished this, what's next?

359
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,520
Anything I want! I mean,
the sky's the limit, right?

360
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,640
But, you know, I've got
some baby steps in mind.

361
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,040
Thanks for dinner, Mr. and Mrs.
Shy. It was great, as usual.

362
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,600
Thank you, dear, for
not giving up on Zephyr.

363
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
After all these years
of pining for him,

364
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,900
it must be so satisfying to
see him on the right track.

365
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,600
Have you heard from
Zephyr? Is he doing well?

366
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,140
I tell you, he's
a brand new pony.

367
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,570
So full of drive
and determination.

368
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
That's great.

369
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,860
Guess who graduated from
mane therapy training?

370
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
Awesome!

371
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,300
Congratulations, son.

372
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,300
You look so handsome!

373
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,620
I'm so proud of
you, Zephyr.

374
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,440
It was only a
matter of time

375
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,100
before they recognized
my true genius.

376
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,340
But actually doing the
work probably helped.

377
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,560
And I wouldn't have
if it weren't for you.

378
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Oh I just gave you
some encouragement;

379
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,680
you did this on your own.

380
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,120
And honestly, right now I
feel like I can do anything.

381
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,000
Except find a place.

382
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,000
I can still crash here
for a few days, right?
