1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,810
Ah, found them!

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,700
Gesundhoof.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,000
Why, thank you, Applejack.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,150
I still can't believe
it's been almost 100 moons

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,400
since our last
family reunion.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,510
Oh, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,250
Well, you have been talking about it
pretty much every day since then.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,670
Apple Bloom, how are them
RSVPs coming along?

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,270
Who's showing their muzzle
at the reunion?

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,580
Everypony!

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,780
Everypony?
Feathers on a goat.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,800
Are you sure?

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,480
Well, I got RSVPs from

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,840
Apples from Yonderhill,
Hollow Shades,

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,810
Galloping Gorge,
Foal Mountains,

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,640
Apples from Fillydelphia,
Tall Tale Town,

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,670
and all the Apples
from Appleloosa.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,620
Oh, and how could I forget?

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,230
Manehattan!
Babs is coming.

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,510
I get to see my favorite cousin!

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,700
I think we're gonna need
a bigger cider trough.

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,110

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,740
Looks like the family's grown tenfold
since the last reunion.

26
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,810
I'm gonna be busier than
a worm in a rotten tomato

27
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,720
trying to get everything ready.

28
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,080
I could always help out.

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,920
- Me too!
- Eeyup.

30
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,740
Oh, I sure would appreciate that.

31
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,000
Granny's a little rustier
in the giddyap

32
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,850
since the last time
the Apples all got together.

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,290
You may be a tad old, Granny,

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,100
but you're as feisty
and full of spark as ever.

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,560
Who you calling old?

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,580
I-- I just meant,

37
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,190
why don't you let me take over putting
the reunion together this time around?

38
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,850
Then all you'll need to worry
about is enjoying yourself.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,350
All right, young 'un.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,650
You got yourself a deal.
You are in charge.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,290
I won't let you down, Granny.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,330
You just tell me what the reunion needs,
and I'll take care of the rest.

43
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,500
I'll do better than tell you
what the reunion will need.

44
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,600
I'll show ya!

45
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,900
We've been hosting these things
at Sweet Apple Acres every 100 moons

46
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,540
since we first planted roots
here in Ponyville.

47
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,120
Hey, who's that?

48
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,350
That'd be your great great
Auntie Applesauce

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,490
when she was just about your age.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,000
Now she used to
go by another name,

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,310
but everypony
started calling her Applesauce

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,020
after half her teeth fell out
when she was making apple jam.

53
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,740
Yeah. Never did find
them teeth in all those jars.

54
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,860
Hey, that's you, Granny!

55
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,010
Sure is.

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,950
Apple family's been working
on that same old quilt

57
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,820
since our first reunion.

58
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,940
I can do it!

59
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,130
Oh, fingle-fangle!

60
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,600
Well, nopony told me I actually
had to knot the end of the thread!

61
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,930
Okay, so I'll need to get
new quilting materials.

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,050
Fabric, needles, thread.

63
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,100
You've really been working on
the same quilt since the first reunion?

64
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,310
Surely have.

65
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,110
I don't think we're ever gonna
finish that doggone thing.

66
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,990
Hey, what's going on here?

67
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,150
Well, you know us Apples
enjoy a good fritter.

68
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:52,610
Hot, hot, hot!

69
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,120
Hey, where'd all them
apple fritters go?

70
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,400
And, who are you, little one?

71
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,470
I'm Applejack.
More apple fritter?

72
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,170
That's how we figured out
your sister had the appetite

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,700
of a full-grown stallion.

74
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,000
Better get twice as much
honey and flour, then,

75
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,260
50 more buckets of apples,
more oil, wood for the fire.

76
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,030
Now, stick an apple in my mouth
and roast my rump!

77
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,030
This one sure
brings back memories.

78
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,950
You know how Babs
is your favorite cousin?

79
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,890
Well, Apple Rose is mine.

80
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,200
<i>The two of us entered the
seven-legged race every reunion.</i>

81
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,550
We're gonna win this one,
cousin.

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,540
You bet your hot diggity
derriere we are!

83
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,920
Come on, cousin,
speed it on up!

84
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,840
Never won a single one
of them races.

85
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,110
Races. We'll need
cloth ties, a finish line.

86
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,140
Not much to a seven-legged race.

87
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,530
And of course we can't forget
to take the big family photo.

88
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,400
We always snapped a photo
in front of the barn

89
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,500
at the end of every reunion.

90
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,580
It lets us see how
our family's grown.

91
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,540
Photo in front of the barn, got it.

92
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,740
You sure have some great memories
of these reunions, don't you?

93
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,580
Indeedy, and I'm looking forward
to making more at this one.

94
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,580
Oh, I'm sure everypony is,
and I do mean everypony.

95
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,150
We got the whole family
together this time around.

96
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,980
Who knows if they'll all be
able to make the next one?

97
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,440
That's true!

98
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,850
Busy as everypony's lives
are getting these days,

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,750
chances are pretty slim we'll
be this lucky next time around.

100
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,540
Don't worry, Granny,

101
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,270
I'm gonna make sure this is
the most memorable reunion

102
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,540
we've ever had.

103
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,230
I better get started.
I've got some planning to do.

104
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,900
Oh, hootenanny, would you look
what your second cousin

105
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,490
is wearing on her head.

106
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,500
Apple Bloom,
what are you doing up?

107
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,500
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

108
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,730
I can't sleep.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,090
My gears are turning in my head
about this reunion.

110
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,300
Yeah, I can't wait
to see my cousin Babs.

111
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,440
We're gonna do
so many fun things together.

112
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,920
Fun? That's just
the beginning of it.

113
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,220
Granny Smith handed me
the reins of this reunion,

114
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,480
and I'm gonna make
the most of it.

115
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,100
Apple Bloom, I've got
so many things planned,

116
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,100
you won't even have
a minute's rest!

117
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,350
Trust me, little sis.

118
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,100
This reunion I'm putting together
is gonna be worth the wait.

119
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,840
Rise and shine!
We don't have much time!

120
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,320
Don't forget the glitter!

121
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,820
- Think that'll do it!
- And just in time too.

122
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,650
They're here!

123
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,410
Apple Rose!

124
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,670
Oh, this is more exciting
than when it rained frogs!

125
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,450
Howdy, y'all!

126
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,980
And welcome
to the Apple Family Reunion!

127
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,740
My name's Applejack,

128
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,910
and I just wanted to let y'all know
that I got a real big day planned for you.

129
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,660
We're gonna start off with an
obstacle course for the young 'uns

130
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,210
and some fritter making and quilting
for the not-so-young 'uns.

131
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,250
And there's lots more to come
after that.

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,550
Hope y'all enjoy it!

133
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,710
Where is she?

134
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
- Babs!
- Coz!

135
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,600
I know it's hasn't been that long
since we've seen each other but--

136
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,720
- It felt like forever!
- It felt like forever!

137
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,250
I can't wait to tell you
about my new school!

138
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,150
I can't wait to hear all about it!

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,100
Jeepers, where do I start?
Okay, so first day--

140
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,640
Babs!
So glad you could come.

141
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,250
What am I, gonna miss out on
spending time with my favorite cousin?

142
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,150
Forget about it!

143
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,400
Why don't you two head over
to the obstacle course?

144
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,740
We kinda want to catch up
a little bit first.

145
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,050
Don't you worry.

146
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,950
There'll be plenty of time
for family bonding

147
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,080
while you're racing against
your other cousins!

148
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,260
All righty, ponies,
ready to have some fun?

149
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,250
Wow, is that the finish line?!

150
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,920
It's like a mile away or something!

151
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,450
Actually, that's just the marker

152
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,700
where you go on to
the next leg of the race.

153
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,350
- There's more?
- Much more. Trust me.

154
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,300
I have put together something
you are never gonna forget!

155
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,690
After the seven-legged race,

156
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,900
you're gonna want to hurry up
and head over here

157
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,860
where you'll be bobbing for apples.

158
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,310
Then you'll run around
these trees 50 times

159
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,400
until you're real good and dizzy.

160
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,150
Then you'll jump
these big wooden hurdles,

161
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,530
and then there's the final leg

162
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,590
where you'll balance plates
on your head while saying,

163
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,370
"pappy pony picked a pluck
of pickly pluffnuggets"

164
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,580
over and over and over again.

165
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,840
The last pony standing wins.

166
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Seriously?

167
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,500
Seriously. Come on, y'all, let's
start making some memories.

168
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,460
On your mark, get set, go!

169
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,800
Looking good, everypony.

170
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,430
Better go check on the quilt.

171
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,850
How long you had those new
chompers, Auntie Applesauce?

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,170
A lady never reveals
the age of her teeth.

173
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,760
Don't you roll your eyes at me,
Miss Apple Rose.

174
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,250
I imagine you two think
I have forgotten

175
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,330
what you did to my
parasol six reunions ago!

176
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,760
We were just using it to help
break open that pinata!

177
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,390
Applejack, delightful to see you.

178
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,770
Are you gonna join us
in some quilting?

179
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,760
Sorry, Auntie Applesauce,
I am busy, busy, busy.

180
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,940
Y'all should get started though.

181
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,490
We couldn't find
our rocking chairs.

182
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,620
I got rid of them
to make room for these.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,160
This is the year y'all are finally
gonna finish that quilt.

184
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,440
Finish it?

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,880
Won't that be exciting?

186
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,500
What's that?

187
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,210
I said, won't that be...

188
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,480
exciting?

189
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,590
I suppose,

190
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,310
although I have been told
that too much excitement

191
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,850
can wreak havoc on this
youthful complexion of mine.

192
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,780
That's the spirit!

193
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,350
What did she say?

194
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,250
What?

195
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,820
Good gracious!

196
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,830
Golden Delicious?
I think he's racing with his cousins.

197
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,050
How is Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle?

198
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,350
Great!

199
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,760
You all right?

200
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,000
So dizzy...

201
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,650
You've got eight now, don't ya?

202
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,150
Oh sure do.

203
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,680
Tell you what, my Apple Tart
may just be a baby, but he is a hoot!

204
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,300
- Having fun?
- Sure are!

205
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,730
Better pick up the pace
on these fritters though, huh?

206
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,950
Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left.

207
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,800
Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left.

208
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,090
Now you try!

209
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,300
That's it! Gotta keep this
assembly line moving, gals.

210
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,050
We want every Apple here
to get the chance

211
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,720
to taste the best
darn fritters in Equestria!

212
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,850
Pappy pony picked
a pluck of pickly pluffnuggets!

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,930
Any other blankflanks
at your new school?

214
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,800
Yeah, two.

215
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,040
Pappy pony picked
a pluck of pickly pluffnuggets!

216
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,940
- Do they want to be Crusaders?
- Totally!

217
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Great! Pappy pony picked a pluck
of pickly pluffnuggets!

218
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,750
Pappy pony picked a pluck
of pickly pluffnuggets!

219
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,670
I can't feel my tongue.

220
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,370
Me neither...

221
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,830
All right, Apples, break!

222
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,340
Finally...

223
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,430
Ooh, can't forget to capture
all these memories for Granny's album!

224
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,770
Nothing all that memorable there.

225
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,940
Or there.

226
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,930
Or there.

227
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,020
Come on, Applejack, think.

228
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,060
You gotta kick
this thing up a notch.

229
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,700
I get that my big sis

230
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,590
wants this to be like
a super awesome reunion,

231
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,660
but that was ridiculous!

232
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,100
I thought we'd never get
a minute to just hang out!

233
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,580
And your minute's up!

234
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,710
Your fellow Apples are waiting
for you to join them.

235
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,120
Applejack, I haven't had
any time with Babs!

236
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,400
We were so busy with
that obstacle course

237
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,090
we didn't even get to talk!

238
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,340
There'll be plenty of time to bond
with Babs when we do the hayride.

239
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,000
Hayride?

240
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,450
All right, everypony,
step right up, take a seat,

241
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,970
and leave the driving
to these stallions.

242
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,960
Now, I know y'all have been working real
hard making some awesome memories,

243
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,690
and in all of our past reunions,

244
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,110
we always had a nice and relaxing
hayride around the farm.

245
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,490
Which is why I decided
to change things up a bit

246
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,900
and try something
just a wee bit more exciting.

247
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,990
So let's get this show
on the road!

248
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,370
Giddyap!

249
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,470
I just had those
professionally polished.

250
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,480
Where in the world
does that girl have us headed?

251
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,890
The west orchard?

252
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,940
Eeyup.

253
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,740
What?! I was joking.

254
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,800
Why, we haven't
tended those fields

255
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,300
since all the trees went
and got filled up with--

256
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,260
Wowsa! I've never seen
real fruit bats before!

257
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,860
Everypony, jump out!

258
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,310
Ruined. Everything is ruined!

259
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,930
Oh, Granny, I'm so, so sorry...

260
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,600
Oh, it's all right, child.

261
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,660
But it's not all right.
Just look at this!

262
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,550
The barn, and all my plans
for the perfect family reunion

263
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,650
are completely destroyed!

264
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,690
Maybe that's a good thing.

265
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,320
How can that possibly be
a good thing?

266
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,210
Applejack, you've had us
so caught up in all the doing,

267
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,900
we haven't had a second
to enjoy the company of the folks

268
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,650
we've been doing it with!

269
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,380
Really?

270
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,800
Oh, Granny Smith,

271
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,620
here, you let me be in charge
of creating great memories,

272
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,100
and the only thing anypony's
gonna remember about this reunion

273
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,100
is that it was the worst one
we ever had.

274
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,940
Hey, now, everypony's
still here, ain't they?

275
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,320
Still plenty of time
to make good memories.

276
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,950
You just gotta give everypony
a chance to actually make them.

277
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,100
The family photo!

278
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,920
Guess we can't take it
in front of the barn this year.

279
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,920
Unless...

280
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,160
Everypony,
I have one more activity!

281
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,700
Applejack...

282
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,770
Trust me, Granny Smith,
this'll be one we'll remember

283
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,070
for all the right reasons.

284
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,270

<i>Look at us
We're family</i>

314
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,050
<i>Working together thankfully</i>

315
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,160
<i>We Apples
We are proud to say</i>

316
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,870
<i>Stick together the pony way</i>

317
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,630
<i>Bow to your partner
Circle right</i>

318
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,550
<i>Get down
If you're scared of heights</i>

319
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,100
<i>Forward, back
And twirl around</i>

320
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,010
<i>That barn's gonna be
The best in town</i>

321
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,110
Yeah!

322
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,960
Yee-haw! Attagirl!

323
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,170
Alright, let's get to it!

324
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,640
<i>Raise this barn
Raise this barn</i>

325
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,310
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

326
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,320
<i>Together
We can raise this barn</i>

327
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,100
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

328
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,880
<i>Take your brushes
Young and old</i>

329
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,650
<i>Together
Paint it bright and bold</i>

330
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,570
<i>Turn 'em round quick
By the left elbow</i>

331
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,450
<i>Grab a new partner
Here we go</i>

332
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,300
<i>We raised this barn
We raised this barn</i>

333
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,250
<i>Yes, we did</i>

334
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,490
<i>Together
We sure raised this barn</i>

335
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,250
<i>Yes, we did</i>

336
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,600
<i>Being together
Counts the most</i>

337
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,380
<i>We all came here
From coast to coast</i>

338
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,870
<i>All we need to strive to be</i>

339
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,010
<i>Is part of the Apple</i>

340
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,900
<i>Family</i>

341
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,670
Yeah!

342
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,000
I can't wait for the next reunion!

343
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,230
Me neither.

344
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,430
I mean, obviously we have
to get together before then.

345
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,470
Obviously.

346
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,840
Oh, you did it, Applejack.

347
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,140
You put on a reunion that
everypony will remember.

348
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,560
Just had a couple minor hiccups
along the way.

349
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,490
Yeah, just a couple.

350
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,530
That's a good one.

351
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,140
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

352
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,500
<i>today I learned a great lesson
about family,</i>

353
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,100
<i>which if you think about it,</i>

354
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,680
<i>is really the first group
of friends you ever make.</i>

355
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,910
<i>Turns out that when you are
with folks you care about,</i>

356
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,550
<i>you don't have to do much
to make that time memorable.</i>

357
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,250
<i>Even the simplest of activities
can take on a whole lot of meaning,</i>

358
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,650
<i>and you'll find that
you remember the who</i>

359
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,830
<i>long after
you've forgotten the what.</i>

360
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,510
<i>Your humble subject,
Applejack.</i>
