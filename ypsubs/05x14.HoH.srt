This gown is quite beautiful,

346
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,560
but it totally clashes
with my complexion.

347
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:27,390
Hmm. Perhaps you'd be even
more taken with this one.

348
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:30,530
It was inspired by the fountain
in the Canterlot Castle Garden.

349
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:33,066
I call it, "The
Fountain of Truth."

350
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:35,755
It's exactly what
I've been dreaming of!

351
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:39,444
Ooh! Well, then, I'll finish it
and the gown shall be yours!

352
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:42,610
How could I have forgotten?

353
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,510
This is what I've
been dreaming about!

[cheers]

362
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:22,044
But this stuff's
still on sale, right?

363
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,680
Yes, yes, of course.

364
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,688
Oh, Rarity,
I'm so sorry!

365
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:29,888
I focused on that
one dress

366
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:33,360
and the rest of Rarity's
Royal Regalia paid the price.

367
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:35,660
Well, so did the
Princess Dress.

368
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:38,422
The more I sewed, the
more each dress lost its

369
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:43,870
Time, Love, and Couture becoming
Terrible, Lackluster and Common.

370
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:47,570
I think I finally understand
the Rules of Rarity

371
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,733
and will apply them
at my next job.

372
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:51,910
I beg your pardon?

373
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,066
The Rules of Rarity
are only to be applied

374
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,510
at Canterlot Carousel.

375
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,888
Which is why you must continue
to manage the boutique

376
00:20:58,888 --> 00:20:59,950
while I'm in Ponyville.

377
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:01,222
Ponyville?

378
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:04,177
Well, yes, I'll come to
Canterlot with new designs

379
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:05,420
and to see the
customers, of course,

380
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,400
but Ponyville was always
going to be my home base.

381
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:10,955
Bobbins and
bodkins, Rarity!

382
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,622
Oh, thank you,
thank you!

383
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:16,570
And I promise to run everything
following your rules!

384
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:18,800
I would expect
nothing less!

385
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:24,111
OH MY GOSH! A SALE?! DO YOU
HAVE THAT PRINCESS DRESS?

386
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:25,133
NO!

387
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,450
