1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,220
You absolutely sure
you can do this?

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,600
Of course! Wouldn't have
agreed to it if I couldn't.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,890
Piece of cake!

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,480
Speaking of cake, I got a little
something I need to attend to.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,620
Yeah, like keeping an eye
on a house full of critters.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,870
Uh, yeah, that was totally
what I was talking about.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,450
Relax! Go to your welcoming
thing in the Crystal Empire.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,120
Spike's got it all under control.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,970
Hurry up, Twilight!
We can't miss our train!

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,110
Tickets.

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,470
Oh, this is gonna be a real treat.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,018
Princess Cadance said she'd never seen
the Crystal Ponies so excited.

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,460
Of course they're excited.
They're up for the Equestria Games!

14
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,040
It's only the biggest sporting
event in all of Equestria.

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,890
Didn't Cloudsdale host
the Equestria Games one year?

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,800
No. Cloudsdale should have
hosted the games one year.

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,060
I'll never forget
when we got the bad news.

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,040
The Equestria Games go to...

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,250
the city of Fillydelphia.

20
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,840
NOOOOOOO!

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,510
These Crystal Ponies lost a thousand
years to an evil King's curse.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,040
They've had enough bad news.

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,760
No way we're letting them experience
the pain of losing out on these games.

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,940
Exactly.

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,860
Princess Cadance is counting on us

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,940
to do our part to convince
the Games Inspector

27
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,490
to choose the Crystal Empire.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,560
And we are not gonna
let her down. Are we?

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,000
NOOOOOOO!

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,760
What? I was just answering
Twilight's question.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,680

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,680
Four, three, two, one,
the Crystal Empire, that's the one!

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,570
Okay, everypony, great job!
Sounds like we're ready.

36
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,130
One more time, from the top.

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,210
Oh, please.
I think that was perfect.

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,380
Well, we've run this like
twelve times already.

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,650
I think we got it.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
Cadance said the Games Inspector

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,520
really puts folks through
the wringer on her visits.

42
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,470
There's no margin for error here.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,770
And this time we need
to practice the steps.

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,470
On a train car?

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,520
You heard the pony!
On your hooves!

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,420
Two, four, six, eight--

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,770
Crystal Empire, ladies!
Watch your step leaving the train!

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,830
Probably should've watched our step
while we were still on it, too.

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,380
The Crystal Empire
looks crystallier than ever!

50
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,680
They must have every pony
in the Empire out sprucing it up!

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,770
This must be why we are asked to handle
the welcome committee routine.

52
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,730
And it's probably also because
we'll be awesome at it!

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Princess Cadance was right.

54
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,420
These ponies
do look pretty darn excited.

55
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,770
Yup, I remember that feeling.

56
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,420
But not as much as I remember

57
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,160
the crushing wave of disappointment
that came when things didn't work out.

58
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,800
That right there!

59
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,130
That is the face
I do not want to see.

60
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,260
We're here.

61
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,160
There are my girls!

62
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,220
Sunshine, sunshine,
ladybugs awake!

63
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,010
Clap your hooves
and do a little shake!

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,530
Oh, my.
This is spectacular.

65
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,720
Please, everypony, stand back!
I need air!

66
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,770
Go ahead and try whatever you like.

67
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,320
It's all complimentary
for the welcome committee.

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,220
That over there
is a crystal mud bath,

69
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,350
which relaxes your body
and rejuvenates your coat.

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,340
Now, I realize it can be kind
of strange to climb into mud,

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,740
but if you'll just give it a chance,
I'm sure--

72
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,210
Pinkie, no!

73
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,090
Ah, so relaxing!

74
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,260
Pinkie Pie, honestly.

75
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,560
Go ahead, have a good time while
I get my ceremonial headdress done.

76
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,190
Ceremonial... headdress?

77
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,990
When meeting
with important guests,

78
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,370
it was tradition for
rulers of the Crystal Empire

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,850
to weave crystals into their manes
in a very specific way.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,870
The Games Inspector is known
for doing her homework.

81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,490
She'll certainly be expecting my look
to reflect the importance of her visit.

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Princess.

83
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,570
If I may have a word,
I have two pieces of news for you.

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,520
First, your mane stylist has the flu
and won't be able to make it

85
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,630
for fear of you catching it, too.

86
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,940
Well...

87
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,710
I hope she's better soon.

88
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,820
Do any of the other
stylists here know

89
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,570
how to do the traditional
royal ceremonial headdress?

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,320
Just a small detail.

91
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,710
You're trying to land
the Equestria Games here!

92
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,080
There is no such thing
as a small detail!

93
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,410
Rainbow Dash!

94
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,170
I suppose...
I could give it a shot.

95
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,850
Oh Rarity,
you would do that for me?

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,680
Way to step it up, Rare!

97
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,620
Fortunately, I have all
the precise instructions right here.

98
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,370
Oh my.

99
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,090
You sure you're up to this?

100
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,720
Working on the hair of royalty
on such an auspicious occasion

101
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,780
is the opportunity of a lifetime!

102
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,470
I will give it
everything I've got!

103
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,920
See? No worries!

104
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,610
Besides, the Games Inspector
isn't expected for several hours.

105
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,670
I'll have plenty of time to figure out
exactly how to... do... this...

106
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh, Rarity, that's wonderful!

107
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,500
You said
you had a second bit of news?

108
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,020
Yes, quite.

109
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,960
The Games Inspector, Ms. Harshwhinny,
will be arriving on the... next train.

110
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,540
What!? You couldn't have
told us that news first!?

111
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,500
That's fifteen minutes from now!

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,540
How long before Cadance is ready?

113
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,790
I'm sure to find some shortcuts.

114
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,990
Can you have her back at the castle
when we're done?

115
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,650
Done!

116
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,650
Okay, we'll be fine.

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,070
Everypony, just look out for the pony
with the flower print luggage.

118
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,070
Easy peasy, pudding in the freezy!

119
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,740
We'll bring the Games Inspector
back to the castle,

120
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,550
put on our big welcome committee
how-do-you-do and then...

121
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,570
Put the pudding out to thaw before
you eat it or you'll crack a tooth?

122
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,520
I'll just ignore that.

123
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,950
We need to remember that
the Games Inspector arriving early

124
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,820
is probably part of a plan
to psyche us out.

125
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,820
What do you mean?

126
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,040
You said it yourself, she's got a rep
for catching hosts off-guard.

127
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,520
Just to see if we can handle
the kind of massive pressure

128
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,770
that comes with hosting
the Equestria Games!

129
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh, no...
We're gonna blow it...

130
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,110
Not if we always stay one step ahead
and don't fall for any of her mind games.

131
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,820
Anything she throws at us,

132
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,870
we just needs to remember
she's testing us and roll with it.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,880
Excuse me, ma'am?

134
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,550
Yes, what is it?

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,050
- Oh, no!
- Be cool.

136
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,150
Well, I know you're not expecting us,

137
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,760
but we're here to personally
welcome you to the Crystal Empire.

138
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,270
The whole lot of you
came to do that?

139
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,840
Uh, well, um, yes!

140
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,010
Well, darn tootin',
ain't that the cat's meow!

141
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,620
Y'all didn't need to do that.

142
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,440
Why, I hardly expected
anything like this.

143
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,790
The Princess wouldn't have had it
any other way.

144
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,610
The Princess? Princess Cadance?

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,620
None other!

146
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:38,230
Well, tie me up and throw me down,
this just keeps gettin' better and better!

147
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,500
- Can we help you with your bags?
- Don't mind if you do!

148
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,680
Ooh, I love flower print!

149
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,570
Sorry.

150
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,660
Our first stop is the castle,

151
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,560
where we got a razzamatazzy
welcome planned for you!

152
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,360
The castle? Are you kidding?

153
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,420
Hot-diggety-dawg!

154
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,460
See that?
We just gotta roll with it

155
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,540
until the Princess gets there
and we'll be just fine.

156
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,740
So, uh... how's it going so far?

157
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,570
Oh, I'm so sorry...
It's just... so complicated.

158
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,760
- I can fix it!
- Fix what?

159
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,980
Well, I was looking for shortcuts
and I thought step twelve was optional!

160
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,850
But it's not!

161
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,470
My golly, the crystal castle!

162
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,470
I've seen pictures but I never expected
to see it with my very own eyes!

163
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,520
From the inside...

164
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,860
Oh my gosh, she's so nice!

165
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,420
You're letting her lull you
into a false sense of confidence.

166
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,820
Watch that.
It's all part of the game.

167
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,180
Oh my, I'm so excited.

168
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,070
Please, have a seat, won't you?

169
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,810
Mind if I take
a quick run outside first?

170
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,040
It was an awfully long train ride
and my legs could use a stretch.

171
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,110
Oh, well...
We were just about to start.

172
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,810
Oh! Never you mind.
You go on ahead. I'm listening.

173
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,640
She was probably testing us to see

174
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,100
if we could remain in control
of a complex situation.

175
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,100
Looks like we passed.

176
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,910
We'd like to thank you
for this opportunity

177
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,880
to introduce you
to this wonderful kingdom!

178
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,180
Oh, well, the pleasure is all mine.

179
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,780
And since we're not even
from here ourselves,

180
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,240
who better than us to let you know
just how welcoming this place can be!

181
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,540
Two, four, six, eight!
Name a place that's really great!

182
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,740
One, two, three, four!
Keeps you coming back for more!

183
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,460
Two, seven, nine, three!
The place that we all wanna be!

184
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,790
Four, three, two, one!
The Crystal Empire, that's the one!

185
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,830
I tell ya!
I have travelled far and wide,

186
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,800
but I have never ever
been welcomed anyplace

187
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,400
in the fashion y'all have
done here today.

188
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,120
That's fantastic!

189
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,090
Princess Cadance
will be so glad to hear that!

190
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,700
Honestly, I'm surprised
she knows anything about me at all!

191
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,180
Of course she does!

192
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,580
She's been looking forward
to your visit for weeks!

193
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,360
Oh, goody! Is she here?

194
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,030
Where the heck is she, anyway?

195
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,100
Wasn't she supposed
to be here by now?

196
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,370
Oh, that's alright.

197
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,710
Maybe-- I'll just take
my little run outside now.

198
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,290
Or, if you like, we could
give you a tour of the castle!

199
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,290
That way you could be learning
and stretching all at the same time!

200
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,130
A tour of the crystal castle...
I'd love that a whole heap.

201
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,030
Dash! We've hardly
ever even been here before!

202
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,470
It's just another test!
We gotta roll with it, remember?

203
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,630
Lemme give the tour!
I'lldoit, I'lldoit, letmeletmeletme!

204
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,450
Fine.

205
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,950
You all start giving her the tour
and I'll go see what's keeping Cadance.

206
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,360
- Hello there!
- Hello yourself.

207
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,600
First hello of the day--

208
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,750
Wha-What are you doing here?

209
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,310
We finished
the welcome committee song

210
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,360
and we just wanted to introduce
Ms. Harshwhinny to--

211
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,380
No, no!

212
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,180
Princess Cadance isn't ready.
Something's gone terribly wrong!

213
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,200
- I need to speak to the Princess.
- You can't! You musn't!

214
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,780
She's in the middle of
a delicate conditioning rinse

215
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,400
that must go perfectly
if there's to be any hope for her hair!

216
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,060
Come on, how bad can it be?

217
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,160
Imagine her mane
turned into a porcupine.

218
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,950
Please, I will bring her back
from the brink of tragedy,

219
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,710
but you have got
to buy me some time!

220
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,800
There's no other way!

221
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,420
So, you see this here?
This, um, this is, um...

222
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,710
a big, round room.

223
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,070
It's known for its roundness.
And bigness.

224
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,710
And did I mention that it's... round?

225
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,930
I think they call it a rotunda?

226
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,050
A small, confining, rotunda...

227
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,450
Whatever.
Round is round, am I right?

228
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,860
Easy, Pinkie,
let's play this safe!

229
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,160
We got her in a good mood,
so let's not do anything to ruin that.

230
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,690
You know...
I love this sort of architecture,

231
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,920
I detect a neo-gothic
inspiration in the design, yes?

232
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,040
Hey! Look at me!

233
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,430
And not a moment too soon.

234
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,510
Where's Cadance?
Please tell me she's right behind you.

235
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,730
There's a bit of a problem
with her headdress.

236
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,000
How's it going here?

237
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,360
I, uh, hate to be a bother,

238
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,440
but the legs are cramping up on me
with all this standing around...

239
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,820
She's getting bored.

240
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,910
And we have
to buy Rarity some more time.

241
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,160
I'll see
if Shining Armor can come help.

242
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,310
Can't one of you other ponies
take over in the meantime?

243
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,440
I got this.

244
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,360
Wanna stretch your legs, huh?

245
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,240
Well, whatever you need,
I'm sure we can provide.

246
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,700
Let's just make our way
to the castle's gymnasium.

247
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,030
Our tour will now be headed...

248
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,380
this way.

249
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,710
And we're walking,
and we're walking...

250
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,210
Twily!

251
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,740
Hello there!

252
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,130
Shining Armor,
you've gotta help me.

253
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,910
Everything okay?

254
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,360
I left the other ponies behind
giving the Games Inspector

255
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,290
the worst castle tour ever.

256
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,780
Come on, gang!

257
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,490
Are we gonna gallop,
or are we gonna trot!?

258
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,930
Castle tour, huh?

259
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,880
I'm pretty sure
I can give you a hoof with that.

260
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,230
Let's move, move, move!

261
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,740
Everything's gonna be okay.

262
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,770
I know, I'm not worried.

263
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,260
I'm not worried... it worked!

264
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,800
I'm outside!

265
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,730
Feels so good
to stretch the old legs!

266
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,150
Uh, what the--

267
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,220
Turns out the crystal castle
doesn't have a gymnasium.

268
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,060
Watch it!

269
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,530
Make her stop!

270
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,660
Wait, that's the Games Inspector!
Let her do her thing.

271
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,960
Oh, these hooves! I'm outside!

272
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,940
- Why would she do that?
- I have no idea.

273
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,010
But, that's why she's in charge
of choosing who gets the Games,

274
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,330
and we're not.

275
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,830
Oh, get me outside for a run!

276
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,850
Look out!

277
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,830
Yeah, okay, we need to stop her.

278
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,640
Where's she going in such a hurry?

279
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,820
Closer... closer...

280
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,770
I think we've got her!

281
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,800
Oh, that felt good!

282
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,760
Nothing like a great run to shake
the cobwebs off these old bones.

283
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,970
Hey there, speedy.

284
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,910
Ah, these wide open spaces
y'all got here remind me of home.

285
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,730
This is great!

286
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,590
Oh! So you're...
enjoying your visit?

287
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,500
Well, I'm so... glad!

288
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,110
Oh good golly, yes, I just love
to travel and see new places.

289
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,430
Such a beautiful spot
you got here, too!

290
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,160
Why... thank you so much!
I'm Shining Armor.

291
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,460
The Prince!

292
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,110
- What's going on?
- From the looks of it,

293
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,080
just locking up the games
for the Crystal Empire is all.

294
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,060
Ain't no thing.

295
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,450
My oh my...
I never met a Prince before...

296
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,730
I'm surprised.

297
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,480
I'd think in your line of work,
you'd meet princes all the time.

298
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,730
Hardly.

299
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,310
Just an ordinary
wild mustang from Mustangia

300
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,310
here to enjoy a little vay-cay.

301
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,510
Never thought I'd also
be meeting royalty to boot.

302
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,850
You are Ms. Harshwhinny,
the Equestria Games Inspector,

303
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,020
aren't you?!

304
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,990
Inspector what-now?

305
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,650
We got the wrong pony?!

306
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,610
NOOOOOOOOOOO!

307
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,170
I mean,
YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!

308
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,830
Oh, please still be here...
oh please oh please oh please...

309
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,790
There's got to be another pony

310
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,430
with flower print luggage
around here somewhere...

311
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,940
Except that there isn't!

312
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,890
We've gotta find her
before Cadance finds out

313
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,610
what a mess
we've made of things.

314
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,320
Okay, here's what we do.

315
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,680
We split the Empire up
into five sectors.

316
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,530
Each of us search a sector.

317
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,970
Well... Except for the spa.

318
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,810
What's the point of checking there?
That's where Cadance is.

319
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,650
If Ms. Harshwhinny is there,
well, then, game over, right?

320
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,280
Every city and empire
wants to host the Equestria Games!

321
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,550
So, I have to go through all the
big phony-baloney song and dance,

322
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,410
though of course, I'm never
getting the real inside scoop.

323
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,320
Oh, golly I've been having
a swell time since I got here!

324
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,080
I'm actually thinking of extendin'
my stay.

325
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,550
And what exactly
has made your visit so special?

326
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,780
Gosh, where to start?

327
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,340
There she is!

328
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,510
We're in luck!

329
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,390
I don't think either of them knows yet
that the other one's here!

330
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,270
Wonderful news, look!

331
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,350
Princess Cadance,
better than new!

332
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,170
Princess Cadance?

333
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,120
So, this is where you've been!

334
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,740
I will have you know

335
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,080
this is by far the worst welcome
I've had in all my years!

336
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,130
I-I can't believe it...

337
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,670
What was wrong
with your welcome?

338
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,640
There wasn't one!

339
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,590
What is going on?

340
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,460
Princess, we gave our welcome
to the wrong pony.

341
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,960
Left the right one
waiting at the station,

342
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,930
and completely ruined everything.

343
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,990
Cinnamon bun?

344
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,320
When I was a little filly,

345
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,310
I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale
to win the Equestria Games.

346
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,530
But, it didn't happen.

347
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,560
So I thought I could make up
for that disappointment

348
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,820
by helping the Crystal Empire win
the chance to host the Games.

349
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,380
But it looks like
I ruined your chances instead.

350
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,960
Not so fast, speedy.

351
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,660
I just finished hearing about how this pony
was just treated to the warmest,

352
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,350
finest, most fabulous reception
she ever had.

353
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,530
Darn tootin'!

354
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,210
Courtesy of these fine ponies
right here.

355
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,400
Which, in my expert opinion,
amounts to the first ever

356
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,260
unvarnished, unrehearsed,
and unbiased appraisal

357
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,800
of a potential host
of the Equestria Games.

358
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,010
Which can only mean one thing...

359
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,570
<i>The next host
of the Equestria Games is...</i>

360
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,030
<i>the Crystal Empire!</i>

361
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,640
We did it!

362
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,030
<i>Congratulations, crystal ponies!</i>

363
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,420
You know,
it feels good to help others

364
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,760
get something you always wanted
but never had.

365
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,360
Almost as good as getting it yourself.

366
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,210
Almost.

367
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,420
We'll still be able to come back here
and watch the games when they're played.

368
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,070
You're right. That'll rock!

369
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,840
Oh, my goodness.

370
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,140
All aboard!

371
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,550
Bummer Spike
had to miss out on all this.

372
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,160
He woulda' had fun here.

373
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,920
I'm sure he's having a great time
watching all the critters back at home.

374
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,920
Think he's still got
a handle on things?

375
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,360
If he's staying calm
and collected,

376
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,320
I bet he's doing
a terrific job as a leader.

377
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,650
You all hear that?
