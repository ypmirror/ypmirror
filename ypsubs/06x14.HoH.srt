Good morning, Miss Cheerilee!

00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:11,126
Good morning, everypony!

4
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:13,107
I hope you brought
your thinking caps

5
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:16,363
because today we're going
to learn about physics!

6
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:18,904
Physics?

7
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:24,092
Mm-hm. Specifically, the use of
force in energy conversions.

8
00:00:24,393 --> 00:00:28,006
In this case, using mechanical
work to convert potential energy

9
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:29,464
into kinetic energy.

10
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,181
The what, now?

11
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:35,243
Um. Mrs. Cheerilee, that
sounds a bit over our heads.

12
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:38,406
Yeah. Why would we even
need to know that stuff?

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,092
Oh, it's very important.

14
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:43,932
In fact, you'll most likely
end up using it tomorrow.

15
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,006
Tomorrow? What for?

16
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:48,707
Why, for participating in the ...

17
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,107
APPLEWOOD DERBY!

thought we were gonna have to

Derby tomorrow? That's so cool!

23

My family's talked
about it for years

Now hold onto your

You've got a lot of work to do
before you're ready to race.

28
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:02,203
Yeah, but not
school work, right?

29
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,203
There'll be a block of
applewood just like this one

30

waiting for you at Sweet
Apple Acres tomorrow

31
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:12,424

it into a race-ready cart.

32
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:14,701
Awwwwww!

33
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:17,741
Oh, yeah. That is
a lot of work.

34
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:22,006
Mm-hmm. Luckily, you'll each
get to pick an older pony

35
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,744
to help you. But
choose wisely

36
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,046
because they'll also
have to ride in the cart

37
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,326
with you during the race.

38
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:32,806
Hmm, I think I know
just the pony to ask!

39
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:33,852
Me too!

40
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:34,941
Me three!

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,310
Just remember everypony,
your cart has to be able

42
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:42,326
to finish the race if you want
to win one of the awards.

43
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:45,987
Fastest, for winning
the race, naturally.

44
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,120
Most Traditional, for
the best working replica

45
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:51,021
of an original Applewood cart.

46
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:55,532
And Most Creative, for the cart
with the best overall design.

47
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,387
Hoo-eee! Those ribbons
are the bees' knees.

48

Uh-huh!

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,301
All right then, class.
You've got a lot to learn

50
00:03:04,332 --> 00:03:05,723
if you want to
build a race cart.

Oh. I knew there was
gonna be a catch.

53
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:19,286
Wow, have you seen what the
carts used to look like

54
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,381
in the olden days?

55
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,507
Yeah. I know all about them.

56
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,421
When Ponyville
started the derby,

57
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,800
they decided to
use the wood

58
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,572
from our apple trees
for the carts.

59
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:32,203
The race has been a part of
Sweet Apple Acres ever since.

60
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,169
I just think these old
carts look so cool.

61
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,209
But I guess you and Applejack
will probably win the award

62
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,655
for most traditional, huh?

63
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,326
The Apples usually
do, but honestly,

64
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:45,292
I'd rather build the fastest
cart there is and win the race!

65
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,929
But I'm pretty sure
Scoot and Rainbow Dash

66
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:51,852
will take that award.

67
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,344
You know, I race around
so much on my scooter,

68
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:58,067
being the fastest isn't such
a big deal. Maybe I'll try

69
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:00,436
to make the wildest-looking
cart I can think of.

70
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,538
Really?

71
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,636
Sure. If I win
Most Creative,

72
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,227
you can totally win
the award for Fastest.

73
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,596
And I can win the award
for Most Traditional!

74
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:11,175
Sounds like we're all going
to try something different.

00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:33,064
Nothing as fun as
painting racing stripes

173
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,658
on the winning cart!

174
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:37,766
[sigh] Right. Fun.

175
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:42,861
Spendin' time building a
cart with my big sister,

176
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:47,673
why this is just tee-riffic!
Um, how can I help?

177
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:51,132
You can feast your
eyes on... this!

178
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,381
I mean, it ain't
quite finished yet.

179
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:56,504
Oh, good.

180
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:59,821
But don't it have the makings of
the best cart you ever did see?

181
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,698
Uh, is somethin'
wrong, Apple Bloom?

182
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,400
Actually, I was kinda
thinking of something

183
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,996
a little more modern.
And less rickety.

184
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,043
With maybe a chance of winning.

185
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,960
Bless my hooves, I
thought we covered this!

186
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:19,101
Tradition is all that counts
and who knows tradition better

187
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:21,649
than Apples? Nopony! That's who!

188
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:25,175
So are you an Apple
or are you an Apple?

189
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,409
I'm an Apple. But, what if I
just take off this fringe.

190
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,578
NO! NOT THE FRINGE!

191
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:32,030

192
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,621
Why, shoot, now I've gotta
start all over from scratch!

193
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:38,215
And it's almost race time.

194
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,110
Oh! So maybe we can redesign
it then... just a little.

195
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:45,033
No time! And who'd want
to redesign something

196
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,707
that's already perfect?

197
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,064
Right. Perfect.

198
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:53,206
OK, so I sketched
out some of my ideas.

199
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,526
How about a nice
yellow fringe on top?

200
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:59,753
Oh-ho, darling, the
fringe is not exactly big.

201
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,138
And that yellow is the least
bold color I can imagine.

202
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,495
Well, it doesn't
have to be yellow.

203
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:08,781
But I really do love the
old-timey style. Like this!

204
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,815
Sweetie Belle, precious face.

205
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:16,855
"Old-Timey" is just
another word for passé!

206
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:21,403
Remember, BIG and BOLD! I do
have a reputation to uphold!

207
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,427
It was one thing
to lose as a filly,

208
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:27,076
but can you imagine if I didn't
win the Most Creative now?

buying my couture!

210

be doing this together!

00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:34,929
Yes, of course we are, darling.

finished! Voila!

bold, I don't know what is.

00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,710
I think that's a
wonderful idea.

341

But maybe the older ponies
should sit this one out.

Thanks for helping us fix up our
carts. Pretty creative, right?

I know it's not traditional, but
it sure looks fast, don't it?

You know, darling, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

346
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:54,584
but that yellow fringe
is rather bold after all!

Thanks, everypony! We couldn't
have done it without you.

are we supposed to do now?

00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:38,750
I think I have an idea.

Ah! Much better. Honestly,
I'm not sure why we wanted

359

in the first place.
