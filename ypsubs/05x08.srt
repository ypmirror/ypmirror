1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,330
<i>La-la-la-la-la.</i>

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,340
<i>La-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la-la.</i>

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,880
This is gonna be
so great, Gummy!

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,740
We have absolutely nothing
to do today except bake!

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,640
I've been waiting for
just the right time

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,740
to finally try Granny
Pie's super special

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,420
triple chocolate fifteen-layer
marjolaine recipe!

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,080
It's gonna be amazing!

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,120
Let's see: nutty meringue,
chocolate ganache,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,460
praline and nuts,
cocoa-flavored buttercream...

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,320
An hour per layer; that's 15
hours of pure baking bliss!

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,260
OK, Gummy, I think we're ready
to start prepping the second layer.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,200
Oh my gosh!

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,260
My Cutie Mark!

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,420
You
know what this means?

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,480
The map!

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,840
Uh, Gummy?

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,190
Could you take over for a bit?

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,780
Hopefully this'll be quick.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,440
I'll just measure the
baking powder for you.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,900
And when the first
layer cools,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
you can drizzle some of
the ganache over it.

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,860
And don't forget to beat the
egg whites for the merengue.

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,320
I know you can do this, Gummy.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,000
You're the best alligator
baker I've ever met.

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,840
Hearing Impaired Subtitles by YayPonies
We have Muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,160
This is so exciting!

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,200
The map is summoning
you to Griffonstone!

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,380
The very heart of
the griffon kingdom!

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,140
I don't know if
either you have read

31
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,240
"Bygone Griffons of Greatness,"
but griffons were known to be--

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,920
Rude, insensitive bullies?

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,020
You mean Gilda?

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,740
Yeah, I mean Gilda!

35
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,100
When she came to Ponyville,

36
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,450
she was a total jerk
to all my friends!

37
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,250
Especially Pinkie Pie!

38
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,480
She was a bit of a party pooper.

39
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,640
Mm-hm.

40
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,900
So maybe Gilda
was a little rude.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,990
You still get to
go to Griffonstone!

42
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,560
And according to this book, it
has a rich, fascinating history.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,960
In ancient times, griffons
were known to be as greedy

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,260
as dragons, always hoarding
their bits and other treasures.

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,660
But all that changed
when King Grover

46
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,540
found the mysterious
golden idol of Boreas!

47
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,020
Legend says the idol
of Boreas was made

48
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,840
from the dust of
golden sunsets,

49
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,470
blown across the mountains
by the north winds.

50
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,420
Possessing the idol of Boreas

51
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,280
filled the griffons'
hearts with pride.

52
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,430
It's said that that one great
treasure is responsible

53
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,270
for turning Griffonstone into the most
majestic kingdom of all the land!

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,850
And why do you care so much
about griffons, anyway?

55
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,660
It was actually Gilda's
visit that made me curious.

56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,420
So I picked up "Bygone
Griffons of Greatness"

57
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,080
and I've been hooked ever since.

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,180
And now...

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,060
Now you two get
to see Griffonstone

60
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,460
with your very own eyes.

61
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,140
Huh?

62
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,820
Just me and Rainbow Dash?

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,180
Hey, you can totally take
my place if you want.

64
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,220
I still had half
a nap to finish.

65
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,860
Why don't you just come with us?

66
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,190
I mean, you are the
Princess of Friendship!

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,820
No no, if the map wanted me to
go to the coolest kingdom

68
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,620
in all of Equestria
and tour the palace

69
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,160
and see the actual idol that
unites an entire species,

70
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,630
which would be super amazing,
I'm sure it would have said so.

71
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,340
You two can handle whatever
the issue is just fine.

72
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,900
I'll stay here and do important
princessy things... I guess.

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,700
Well then, c'mon Dashie!

74
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,560
We're goin' to Griffonstone!

75
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,320
Fine.

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,980
That's the spirit!

77
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,760
Whatcha reading, Rainbow?

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,040
Twilight literally
wrote a book

79
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,820
on what we need to
do in Griffonstone.

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,080
You mean like a guide on how to figure
out what problem we're supposed to fix?

81
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,780
And then some.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,540
It's like Twilight
herself in book form!

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,100
"Always carry plenty of bits.

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,960
The griffons are
sure to help you

85
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,040
as long as you
share the wealth."

86
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,600
Can I borrow some bits?

87
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,980
<i>Upon
arriving at Griffon Gorge,</i>

88
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,240
<i>be sure to pause and
cast your eyes northerly</i>

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,220
<i>up the Hyperborean Mountains,</i>

90
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,900
<i>taking in the breathtaking
beauty of Griffonstone.</i>

91
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,400
<i>Once in Griffonstone proper,
go immediately to the palace</i>

92
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,240
<i>and introduce
yourself to the King.</i>

93
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,480
<i>"Bygone Griffons of Greatness"
was written a long time ago</i>

94
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,660
<i>and it ends with the coronation of
the fourteenth king of the griffons,</i>

95
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,620
<i>King Guto.</i>

96
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,220
<i>I have no idea
who's in charge now.</i>

97
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,860
<i>Tell the King you've been sent
by the Princess of Friendship</i>

98
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,150
<i>and you're there to help
with some sort of problem.</i>

99
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,620
<i>If for some reason
the King can't help,</i>

100
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,990
<i>I'd try the Griffonstone
library next.</i>

101
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,440
<i>It's a little known secret that
if you befriend a librarian,</i>

102
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
<i>you can usually
find out anything.</i>

103
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,060
<i>Plus, as a bonus, there's a
statue of King Grover outside!</i>

104
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,120
<i> Photo op!</i>

105
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,260
<i> And don't forget to sample
some famous Griffon Scones!</i>

106
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,270
<i>They're supposed to be the best!</i>

107
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,500
Aw, Twilight should
have come along.

108
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,620
Then she could have seen first
hoof that Griffonstone is...

109
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,880
...a total dump!

110
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,140
Ugh, maybe the map should have
called Rarity instead of us.

111
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,640
Excuse me, sir?

112
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
This is Griffonstone, right?

113
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,960
Well, that wasn't
very nice.

114
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,240
See? These griffons are exactly
what I thought they'd be.

115
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,840
Maybe we should just
find the palace

116
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,480
so we can ask the
king what's going on.

117
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,240
We don't have a
king, loosers.

118
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,080
Hello, Gilda.

119
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,900
Dash.

120
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,020
Pinkie!

121
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,740
What're you
doing here?

122
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,460
Uh, I'm a griffon?

123
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,440
What's your excuse, dweebs?

124
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,200
Hey! These dweebs are here
to help Griffonstone!

125
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,880
Help it what?

126
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,460
Well, we're not really sure.

127
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,060
But it involves a map and Cutie
Marks and a problem and--

128
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,340
Bored now.

129
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,140
Well, if you don't have a king,

130
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,520
can you at least tell us
where the idol of Boreas is?

131
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,960
Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really
believe in that thing.

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,800
You'd
better believe in it!

133
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,100
The idol was the best thing
to ever happen to us griffons!

134
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,720
Oh, great!

135
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,000
Now you got Grampa
Gruff started.

136
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,100
I'll tell you the whole
tragic tale...heh heh heh.

137
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,880
For a couple of bits.

138
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,900
The first griffon
king, King Grover,

139
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,400
united our kind like we've never
been united before or since.

140
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,980
And he did it all with that
incredible idol of Boreas.

141
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,220
That idol brought pride to the
heart of every griffon that saw it.

142
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,140
From one king to the next,
Griffonstone and our golden idol

143
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,560
were the envy of
all other species.

144
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,300
It held us together,
gave us an identity.

145
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,860
Right up until the
reign of King Guto.

146
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,880
That's when Arimaspi came.

147
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,340
To steal our griffon treasure.

148
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,320
King Guto tried
to fight him off,

149
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,880
but Arimaspi managed to
get away with the idol.

150
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,500
They say when our treasure
fell into the Abysmal Abyss,

151
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,400
our pride went with it.

152
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,380
King Guto was the last
king of Griffonstone

153
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,880
and we all lived
miserably ever after.

154
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,560
The end.

155
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,640
That was the saddest story ever.

156
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,180
Oh, well ... tough
tailfeathers! No refunds!

157
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,140
No wonder Twilight's book ended
with the coronation of King Guto.

158
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,400
Who would want to record
a history that sad?

159
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,840
It's not sad!

160
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,620
Do we look sad to you?

161
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,600
Pinkie, I think I know
why the map sent us here!

162
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,500
We need to find
the idol of Boreas

163
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,240
and bring glory and pride
back to Griffonstone!

164
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,980
Ha ha.

165
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,520
Here we go, typical
pony hero complex.

166
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,840
None of us care about
that dumb old idol.

167
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,820
Don't you get it?

168
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,320
We don't care about anything
and that's the way we like it.

169
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
I think Rainbow Dash is right.

170
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,260
The map sent us here to
fix some sort of problem.

171
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,320
The only problem
Griffonstone has is you!

172
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,140
Well, I don't care
what she says.

173
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,400
We're going to
find that treasure,

174
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,420
make Griffonstone cool again,
and get back to Ponyville.

175
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,940
C'mon!

176
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,040
Wait, Rainbow Dash, what
about Twilight's advice?

177
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,360
What, taking a
bunch of pictures?

178
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,940
She mentioned finding
answers at the library.

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,260
Knock yourself out.

180
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,740
But when you get bored
with Twilight's tour book,

181
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,960
I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss
finding the idol of Boreas.

182
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,700
I'm here to find your missing
idol and save Griffonstone!

183
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,940
Uh, I'll need some
rope, a grappling hook,

184
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,320
and a guide to take me
down to the Abysmal Abyss.

185
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,120
And I'll need some bits.

186
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,040
Hey, Gilda!

187
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,320
Word on the street is that
Griffonstone has an amazing

188
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,060
library chock-full of answers!

189
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,120
Word on what street?

190
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,860
OK, maybe not this street.

191
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,060
But on other streets, your
library is the talk of the town.

192
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,680
The library's right there

193
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,920
so why don't you go inside

194
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,160
AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

195
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,800
Maybe it's good that
Twilight didn't come.

196
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,280
It's sad what happened
to your town, King.

197
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,100
But Rainbow Dash can't be right.

198
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,180
This can't all be because
of a missing hunk of gold.

199
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,180
"You're right, Pinkie.

200
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,300
And you've got amazing hair."

201
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,780
Aw, King Grover,
you old charmer.

202
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,740
I know what Griffonstone needs!

203
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,300
Fewer ponies?

204
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,100
A song!

205
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,400
I've got a super
song about smiling

206
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,660
that's sure to make even the
most grumpy griffon grin!

207
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,900
You can't sing here.

208
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,260
But how do you break into uplifting
musical numbers with no singing?

209
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,840
Yeah, that's Griffonstone's
biggest problem.

210
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,900
Lack of uplifting
musical numbers.

211
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,580
Well, if I can't sing,
how 'bout a party?

212
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,880
If there's one thing these griffons
need, it's some good cheer.

213
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,220
Where's your party store?

214
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,980
No party store?

215
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,600
Aw. How about cake?

216
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,220
Nothing cheers
folks up like cake!

217
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,120
Where's your bakery?

218
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,100
NO SINGING?

219
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,460
NO PARTY STORE?

220
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,640
NO BAKERY?

221
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,320
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

222
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,540
You're welcome to
leave at any time.

223
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Well, that just takes the cake.

224
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,460
Wait, no.

225
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,560
It can't take the cake
cause there is no cake!

226
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,660
Or muffins!

227
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Or Griffon Scones!

228
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,220
Oh, we got Griffon Scones.

229
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,500
That's my specialty.

230
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,780
I'll buy one!

231
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,620
Bits first.

232
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,580
Well?

233
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,240
What, you like it?

234
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,800
That's my Grampa
Gruff's secret recipe.

235
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,060
Ow! I think I broke a tooth.

236
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,640
Well, whatever, no refunds.

237
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,480
I don't even care anyway.

238
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,020
I just want to sell
enough of these

239
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,040
so I can leave this lousy town.

240
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,680
I can help you with that!

241
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,820
Uh, you think you could
tighten the strap on my helmet?

242
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,720
Can you give me more bits?

243
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,240
Never mind.

244
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,120
I got it.

245
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,060
So how deep is this abyss?

246
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,940
How deep are your pockets?

247
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,220
Don't you griffons ever talk
about anything but bits?

248
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,080
Give me some bits
and I'll answer.

249
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,520
No wonder Gilda's
such a delight.

250
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,860
Grampa Gruff's recipe is good,

251
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,120
but it's missing one
important ingredient.

252
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,380
Don't tell me...friendship?

253
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,920
Uh, no.

254
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,300
Baking powder.

255
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,960
Lucky for you I never
leave home without it!

256
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,460
Now just pop those in the oven
and you'll have Griffon Scones

257
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,000
worth their weight in gold!

258
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,440
Oof!

259
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,520
Greta!

260
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,280
AH-HA!

261
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,760
I saw that, Gilda!

262
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,680
You may act like a
gruff, grumbling griffon,

263
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,660
but inside you're
gracious and great!

264
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,040
What are you talking about?

265
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,780
You just helped your friend
up when she got knocked down.

266
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,140
What, her?

267
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,180
Greta's just some
griffon I know.

268
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,240
We don't have friends here.

269
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
I did have a friend once,

270
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,680
but you saw how that turned out.

271
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,080
Oh my gosh!

272
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,780
I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!

273
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,780
See ya.

274
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,540
You sure we can't just fly down?

275
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,160
Whoa!

276
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,880
Never mind.

277
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,660
Totally got my answer there.

278
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,620
Just gotta find that Golden
Idol and get out of this place!

279
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,300
Aaaaah!

280
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,780
Aaaaah!

281
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,140
Oof!

282
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,520
Oh! Oww!

283
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,080
Ooh!

284
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,940
My hoof!

285
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,300
Help!

286
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,540
Throw me another rope!

287
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,820
You got bits?

288
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,840
Wait!

289
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,220
HELP!

290
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,540
AHHHHH!

291
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,800
There you are!

292
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,980
Forget about finding the idol.

293
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,700
I figured out how to solve
Griffonstone's real problem!

294
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,140
SCONES!

295
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,960
PINKIE PIE, YOU GET BACK HERE!

296
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,600
Yeah?

297
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,980
Can you throw down
a rope or something?

298
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,240
Lemme look.

299
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,820
One rope, comin' up!

300
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,060
We need help!

301
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,160
Don't go anywhere!

302
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,460
Where does she
think I'm gonna go?

303
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,600
Unh!

304
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,500
I hope I don't go anywhere!

305
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,540
Rainbow Dash is stuck
on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss

306
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,820
and I need your
help to save her!

307
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Not my problem.

308
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,560
Of course it's your problem!

309
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,700
She's your friend!

310
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
Used to be.

311
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,280
Can't you remember when she was?

312
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,660
Yeah.

313
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,840
Of course.

314
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,300
Doesn't that griffon know that
she's supposed to fly

315
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,660
at the Junior
Speedsters Flight Camp?

316
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,980
Maybe she just doesn't
want to make you look bad.

317
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,700
Hey there!

318
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,980
I'm Rainbow Dash.

319
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,460
And you are...?

320
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,680
Uh, G-Gilda?

321
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,560
You sure about that?

322
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,640
Stick with me, Gilda,

323
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,280
and those guys won't
give you any more guff!

324
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,680
Whoa! You're awesome!

325
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,620
You too, Rainbow Dash!

326
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,640
Well, Gilda, let's show
these guys how it's done.

327
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,080
Junior Speedsters are our lives!

328
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,520
Sky bound soars
and daring dives!

329
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,820
Junior Speedsters
it's our quest,

330
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,460
to someday be the VERY BEST!

331
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,440
Fine.

332
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,380
I'll help her.

333
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,320
But that doesn't
make me her friend.

334
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,420
Duly noted.

335
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,280
Except it does.

336
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,360
Hang on, loser!

337
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,820
I'm coming!

338
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,760
What took you so long, doofus?

339
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,700
RAINBOW DASH!

340
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,420
I'M COMIN' FOR YA!

341
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,640
AAAAAAHHHH!

342
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,720
Gotcha!

343
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,740
Hold on, you two!

344
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,060
Huh?

345
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,080
The idol of Boreas!

346
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,560
I'm slipping!

347
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,140
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

348
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,040
The idol!

349
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,540
You're more important to me
than some dumb chunk of gold!

350
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,020
Hugging later!

351
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,660
Climbing NOW!

352
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,060
I'm really sorry about
how I treated you two.

353
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,460
Thanks, Gilda.

354
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,440
Apology accepted.

355
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,100
And I'm just sorry we
didn't get your idol back.

356
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,380
Now we'll never be able to
solve Griffonstone's problem.

357
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,720
That's what I was
trying to tell you!

358
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,840
The map didn't send us here to
find the lost idol of Boreas.

359
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,400
It sent us here to replace
it with something better!

360
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,460
Nothing's better than
gold to a griffon.

361
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,960
That's because you
don't have friendship.

362
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,500
If you can learn to care
about each other again,

363
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,780
Griffonstone could be a mightier
kingdom than it ever was before!

364
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,540
And you don't need some
golden idol to do that.

365
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
You just need each other.

366
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,260
Whoa, Pinkie.

367
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,740
That was...really sappy.

368
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,680
Eh, what can I say?

369
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,920
That's how I roll.

370
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,820
Go on, Gilda.

371
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,300
Go make a friend.

372
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,400
I don't know, Pinkie.

373
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,400
You really think these
griffons are up for this?

374
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,820
We aren't exactly in
Ponyville, you know.

375
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,420
OK.

376
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,320
So she was really weirded out
until I gave her the scone.

377
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,680
Then she tried it and
said it tasted good!

378
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,080
That's the first nice thing
any griffon's ever said to me!

379
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,060
Whoa, Pinkie!

380
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,760
I guess that really was the
problem we needed to solve.

381
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,760
Baking powder makes baked
goods and friendships

382
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,100
fluffy and delicious!

383
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,260
Well, we better
be headin' home.

384
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,100
What? Y-y-you want me to spread
friendship here by myself?

385
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,420
How am I supposed to do that?

386
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,140
I haven't even made
one single friend yet!

387
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,380
No, you haven't.

388
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,420
You've made two.

389
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,500
Hugging!

390
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,340
Hugging now!

391
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,660
But you'll come back
and visit, right?

392
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,940
Just try and stop us!

393
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,340
See you later,
you old charmer.

394
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,960
Uh, Pinkie?

395
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,220
Who are you
talking to?

396
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,820
Nopony! Come on, let's go
home and see how Gummy did

397
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,900
with Granny Pie's
marjolaine recipe...
