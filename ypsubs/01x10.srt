1
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,515
Thank you, little squirrel.

2
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:20,455
But remember, these flowers
are for Princess Celestia.

3
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:22,890
Only the prettiest ones will do.

4
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,166
Hellooo, little guy.

5
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:44,769
I've never seen anything like you before.

6
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,555
Oh! Are you hungry?

7
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:51,982
Here you go.

8
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:58,575
I guess you *were* hungry.

9
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:07,142
You're the cuuutest thing ever!

10
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:09,975
I can't wait to show you to my friends.

11
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,423
Oh! Hurry up, Spike!

12
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:56,271
This place isn't gonna clean itself!

13
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:58,833
It also didn't mess itself up.

14
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:01,467
Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!

15
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,439
I thought this was just an unofficial, casual visit.

16
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,011
There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty!

17
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,534
I want this place to be spotless.
And you've barely made a dent in the clutter!

18
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:14,235
Maybe you should...
start reading them... one at a time!

19
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:19,734
Everything's got to be perfect.
No time for fooling around!

20
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,512
You know, this would be an awful lot easier...

21
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:24,982
...if there weren't two of us here
getting under each other's feet.

22
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:29,055
Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how
everyone else's preparations are coming.

23
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:30,188
Or maybe I should...?

24
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,219
What happened to the rest of her name?

25
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:50,458
We couldn't fit it all in.

26
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,146
You can't hang a banner that says
"Welcome Princess Celest".

27
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:54,754
Take it down and try again.

28
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:01,927
That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.

29
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:13,458
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.
How's the banquet coming?

30
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:16,999
It would be coming a little better if...

31
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:27,940
Pinkie! What are you doing?!

32
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:30,591
Those sweets are supposed to be for the Princess!

33
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:32,913
I-I know. That's why I'm tasting them.

34
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:38,039
Somepony needs to make sure that everything
is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue.

35
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:43,431
And I, Pinkie Pie, declare that
these treats are fit for a king!

36
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:46,129
Or a queen! Or a princess!

37
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,908
Twilight! Pinkie! You won't believe...!

38
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:54,791
Oh. I'm sorry. Uh... Am I interrupting?

39
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,735
No, not at all. Come on in
and make yourself at home.

40
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,083
What's going on, Fluttershy?

41
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,834
You won't believe what I found
at the edge of the Everfree Forest.

42
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:09,552
Come on out, little guy. It's okay.

43
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:14,299
Three?

44
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:17,626
They're amazing! What are they?

45
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:22,446
I'm not sure. I'm also not sure
where these other two came from.

46
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,081
I'll take one off your hoofs.
I've never seen anything so...

47
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,414
...ADORABLE!

48
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:32,180
Besides, it'll be nice to have
a companion for Spike...

49
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,315
...so won't bother me so much
while I'm studying.

50
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:36,831
Pinkie, do you want the other one?

51
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:39,972
Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?

52
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:42,893
-Ugh?
-A para-what?

53
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:44,606
How could you not like...

54
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:47,066
Now I gotta go find a trombone!

55
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,030
A what?

56
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,004
A trombone. You know...

57
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:54,888
Typical Pinkie.

58
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:01,157
[Stand still, Rainbow Dash.]

59
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,908
I can't! I need to fly!

60
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:07,837
This is way too boring for me.

61
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:11,149
Do you want to look nice
for Princess Celestia or not?

62
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:17,515
Wow! Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous!

63
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:19,542
Hm, thank you, Twilight.

64
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:22,369
Nice to know *someone* appreciates my talents.

65
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:25,872
Sooo boooring.

66
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:28,169
Huh?

67
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:30,077
What's that sound, Twilight?

68
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:37,132
Wow! What are they?

69
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,767
The better question is: where did they come from?

70
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,669
I only had one a minute ago.

71
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,138
Uh, I'll take one!

72
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:45,730
Me too. Oh, they're perfect!

73
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:48,684
Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?

74
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,086
Girls! Hello! This is important!

75
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:55,068
Durgh! Thanks a lot!

76
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:07,420
Oh, the decorations... the banquet...

77
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,398
I really hope everything comes
together in time for tomorrow.

78
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,966
What's there to worry about?

79
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:38,591
Spike!

80
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,189
Wake up! What happened?!

81
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:45,770
What's going on?

82
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,188
Where did they come from?

83
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:52,153
I don't know. The little guy got hungry
in the night, so I gave him a snack, but...

84
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:54,557
...I have no idea where these others came from.

85
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:59,288
Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!

86
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,081
The Princess will be here in a few hours!

87
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:12,441
Spike! Help me round up these little guys!

88
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:16,399
What does it... look like I'm... doing?

89
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:24,086
I know, I know. "Stop fooling around."

90
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:48,626
Get off me!

91
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:05,494
Not only are you adorable...

92
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,500
...but you're also quite useful.

93
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:11,802
Oh! Are you okay?

94
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,502
Eeew!

95
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,427
Gross, gross, gross!

96
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:25,222
No creature that behaves so revoltingly
is allowed in my boutique!

97
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:33,716
Look, Rarity! Applejack lent me a harmonica!

98
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:36,210
Isn't that great?

99
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,021
And not a moment too soon.

100
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:42,143
Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.

101
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:44,990
And I'm not?! You know how many
more instruments I've gotta find?

102
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,288
A lot! That's how many.

103
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:49,656
Now if we split the list between us,
we might just make it in time.

104
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:53,703
Please, Pinkie! I don't have time
for some silly scavenger hunt.

105
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:55,446
I've got a real problem.

106
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,355
You've got a real problem, all right.

107
00:08:57,394 --> 00:09:00,069
And a banjo is the only answer!

108
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:08,052
I see we've having the same problem.

109
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:09,097
Get out!

110
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:14,236
Fluttershy knows everything about animals.

111
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:17,008
I'm sure she can tell us how to
stop them from multiplying.

112
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,354
Or not.

113
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:27,774
Do something, Fluttershy! Can't you control them?

114
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:29,338
I've tried everything I know.

115
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:33,078
I've tried begging and pleading
and beseeching and asking politely and...

116
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:50,533
If we can't get them under control
before the Princess arrives...

117
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,365
...it'll be a total disaster!

118
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,522
EEEW!

119
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,193
If you ask me, it's already a total disaster!

120
00:09:57,883 --> 00:09:59,837
Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy!

121
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,469
But I still can't figure why ya need so many.

122
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:03,982
Hey!

123
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:05,572
What do we do?

124
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,061
I got it!

125
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:09,374
Nopony can herd like Applejack!

126
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,417
Yeah! We can drive them back into the forest!

127
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:15,607
I'll rustle 'em up, but I need
everypony's help to do it.

128
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,114
Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there.

129
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:20,393
I'll herd the little critters
straight at ya like a funnel.

130
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:23,708
Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy
stay on top of 'em.

131
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,103
Don't let 'em fly away.

132
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:26,223
Aye, aye!

133
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:28,751
YEEHAW!

134
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:47,339
All right, y'all. Here goes nothin'!

135
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,475
Look out, Rarity!
That one's fixin' on gettin' away!

136
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:52,564
Keep a lean on 'em, Rainbow Dash!

137
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,841
Hold on, girls. We're almost there!

138
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:58,367
Pinkie!

139
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,415
Twilight! We don't have much time.

140
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:03,439
You're telling me? The Princess
could arrive at any moment.

141
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:06,587
Exactly! That's why I need you, girls,
to drop what you're doing...

142
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:08,592
...and help me find some maracas!

143
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:09,896
Maracas?

144
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:13,012
Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas!

145
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:14,496
You're right!

146
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,914
Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal.

147
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:17,839
Follow me!

148
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:21,493
I said: follow me!

149
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:22,690
Pinkie Pie...

150
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:25,642
...you are so random.

151
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:28,162
Ugh, you are also stubborn!

152
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:30,271
Forget her, ladies.

153
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:33,114
Focus! Head 'em up and move 'em out.

154
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,385
Alright!

155
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,977
Ouch.

156
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,800
We did it! Nice work, Applejack.

157
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,369
Couldn't have done it without y'all.

158
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:53,874
Now let's get back and clean up the mess
they made before the Princess arrives.

159
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:57,194
Okay. Everyone knows what to do, right?

160
00:11:57,194 --> 00:12:00,058
We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.

161
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:07,097
Where did *they* come from?

162
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:10,692
Well... I may have kept just one.

163
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,534
I couldn't help myself. They're just...

164
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:18,805
...so cute.

165
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:21,316
We don't have time to
keep rounding up these things!

166
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:22,639
What do we do now?

167
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:25,203
We call in the weather patrol!

168
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:33,857
Time to take out the adorable trash.

169
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,221
YAAA!!!

170
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,094
Way to go, Rainbow Dash!

171
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:57,499
Looks like our problems are solved.

172
00:12:57,721 --> 00:12:59,537
They will be with these cymbals!

173
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,570
Hey! Gimme those back!

174
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:13,223
I can't hold it! She's breaking up!

175
00:13:21,356 --> 00:13:24,445
Pinkie Pie! What have you done!?

176
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:27,568
I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals,
that's what I've done!

177
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:31,264
Will you forget about your
silly instruments for one second?

178
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:33,993
You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville!

179
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:36,209
Me?! Ruin?!

180
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:39,189
I'm not the ruiner. I am the ruinee!

181
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:41,272
Or is it ruiness?

182
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,685
Ruinette?

183
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:46,196
Come on, girls!
There's no reasonin' with that one.

184
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,173
She's a few apples short of a bushel.

185
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:53,503
Hey! I'm trying to tell you all
that the ruining is on the other hoof!

186
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:55,913
If you just slowed down and LISTENED TO ME...!

187
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:23,276
What do we do?
They're eating all the food in town.

188
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,146
My apples!

189
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:27,515
We've gotta do something!

190
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,908
I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them
stop eating all the food.

191
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,218
Look! Tambourines! If you could all just...!

192
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:16,570
Hey! It worked. They're not
eating the food anymore.

193
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:21,197
Oh no. If they get inside my store...

194
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:24,191
EVERYPONY FOR HERSELF!

195
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:30,130
MY OUTFITS!

196
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:37,632
Go on! Shoo! Get out! Naughty, naughty!

197
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:46,668
I'll save you!

198
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:01,625
No woodland creature's gonna
eat the Apple family's crop!

199
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:06,112
Brace yourself, y'all!

200
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:07,535
Here they come!

201
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:21,749
Didn't see that one comin'.

202
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,426
Help!

203
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:33,047
They're eating the words!

204
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:41,280
Help.

205
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,765
Have you gone mad?

206
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:55,656
Zecora! These little guys
are devouring Ponyville!

207
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:59,036
And the Princess is on her way!
Can you help us? Please?

208
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:02,926
Oh, monster of so little size.

209
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:05,794
Is that a parasprite before my eyes?

210
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,345
I don't know! Is it?

211
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,778
Tales of crops and harvests consumed.

212
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:14,658
If these creatures are in Ponyville...

213
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,530
...you're doomed.

214
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:26,008
Oh no! Here she comes!

215
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,472
Okay. Here's the plan.

216
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,324
Rainbow Dash, you distract them.

217
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:46,858
Good! Everyone else, we need to build
an exact copy of Ponyville right over there.

218
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,525
We've got less than a minute.

219
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,991
Zecora was right. We're doomed.

220
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:58,923
Oh no. The Princess's procession
is here. It's all over!

221
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,533
Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here.

222
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:10,966
This is no time for your...

223
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,288
...nonsense?

224
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,444
Look!

225
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,138
Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil!

226
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,727
Hello, Princess!

227
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,021
So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.

228
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:03,174
So... How was the trip? Hit much traffic?

229
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,206
What is this?

230
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,593
These creatures are adorable!

231
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,677
They're not *that* adorable.

232
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:18,053
I'm terribly honored that you
and the good citizens of Ponyville...

233
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:20,733
...have organized a parade in honor of my visit.

234
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:24,636
Parade? Oh! Yes! The parade!

235
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:28,823
Unfortunately that visit is going to
have to wait for another time.

236
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:32,056
I'm afraid an emergency has
come up in Fillydelphia.

237
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:35,611
Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.

238
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:37,593
An... infestation?

239
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:42,959
Yes. A swarm of incredibly bothersome
creatures has invaded the poor town.

240
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,461
I'm sorry, Twilight, to have to
put you all through so much trouble.

241
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:49,777
Trouble? Oh... What trouble?

242
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:51,596
Before I have to go...

243
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:55,657
...would you care to give me your latest report
on the magic of friendship in person?

244
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,741
My... report?

245
00:19:57,956 --> 00:19:59,962
Haven't you learned anything about friendship?

246
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,346
Actually, I have.

247
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:11,314
I've learned that sometimes the solution to your
problems can come from where you least expect it.

248
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,759
It's a good idea to stop and listen to
your friends' opinions and perspectives.

249
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:20,652
Even when they don't always seem to make sense.

250
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,564
I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle.

251
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:25,982
And I'm very impressed with your friends as well.

252
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:29,143
It sounds like you're all learning
so much from each other.

253
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:30,721
Thank you, Princess.

254
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,078
Hey! What happened to the Princess?

255
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:40,498
Emergency in Fillydelphia.

256
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:43,333
Some sort of "infestation".

257
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,113
Oh no! Have they got parasprites too?!

258
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,656
Well, have tuba, will travel.

259
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:51,383
I think the Princess can handle it.

260
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,069
So you knew what those critters
were all along, huh, Pinkie Pie?

261
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:59,688
Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic
to get my hooves on all these instruments?

262
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:01,282
I tried to tell you.

263
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:04,107
We know, Pinkie Pie.
And we're sorry we didn't listen.

264
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,022
You're a great friend.

265
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:10,863
Even if we don't always understand you.

266
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:13,373
Thanks, guys. You're all great friends too.

267
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,154
Even when I don't understand me.

268
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,930
You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia!

269
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,256
And more importantly, you saved Ponyville!

270
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,003
Or not.

271
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:33,707
