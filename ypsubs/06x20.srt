00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:03,673
<i>The map is sending us</i>
<i>WHERE?!</i>

2
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:06,092
<i> Las Pegasus?</i>

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,673
But Las Pegasus is a
wild vacation spot.

4
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,864
It's just one big party!

5
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:15,415
All those lights and sounds,
not to mention the crowds!

6
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:18,153
Oh! Just the thought
of it is overwhelming.

7
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,950
I know Las Pegasus doesn't seem
like either of your cups of tea,

8
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:24,320
but I have total faith you
wouldn't have been called

9
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:26,615
unless you were the perfect
ponies for the job.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,800
Probably not as
bad as we think.

11
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,329
It can't just be
a loud obnoxious party

12
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,193
all the time... right?

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,701
Uh, Applejack. It isn't
as bad as we thought.

14
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:42,289
PARTY ALL NIGHT! WHOO-HOO!

15
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:44,363
You're right.
It's worse!

17
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:37,667
Do you think the map could
be on the fritz again?

18
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:41,058
I mean, this place seems a
lot more suited to Pinkie Pie

19
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:42,960
or even Rainbow Dash.

20
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:46,923
If Twilight trusts
the map then so do I.

21
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,526
All we have to do is solve
our friendship problem

22
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:50,861
and get back home.

23
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,566
Of course, we have
to find it first.

24
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:57,446
And make sure to experience
our signature show:

25
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:59,360
Poné Fantastique!

26
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:02,800
Trust me when I say you've
never seen anything like it!

27
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:06,098
Unparalleled acrobatics,
unique animal antics!

28
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:09,452
Your only regret will be that
you didn't see it sooner!

29
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:12,283
And like everything at
this amazing, incredible,

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,603
"I can't believe it
even exists" hotel,

31
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,206
Poné Fantastique is
brought to you by the

32
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,224
Chairpony of Kindness,
Gladmane himself!

33
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,975
Wow. This Gladmane
sure seems impressive.

34
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:32,363
Well, uh, it is a little embarrassin'.

35
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:36,123
But the crowds seem to
like it, uh-huh-huh.

36
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,741
Mr. Gladmane?

37
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,673
Just Gladmane'll do.

38
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,344
And it's a pleasure
to meet actual cohorts

39
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,840
of the Princess
of Friendship!

40
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:46,861
Thank you for coming.
Thank you very much.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,720
You know who we are?

42
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:51,975
I'm what you might call a
friendship connoisseur,

43
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:54,843
so naturally I'm familiar
with the friends of the great

44
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:58,067
Twilight Sparkle!
Applejack, Fluttershy,

45
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:01,261
it's an honor to have
you here, uh-huh-huh.

46
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,384
I have to admit you're
not the type of pony

47
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,630
I expected to find
in Las Pegasus.

48
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:10,080
My guests may be looking for
lights, music, and parties,

49
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:12,923
but working hard
and making friends

50
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:15,827
is how I turned this hotel
into what it is today.

51
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:19,501
And how I plan to make it
even bigger. Uh-huh-huh.

52
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:21,821
Uh, excuse me one second.

53
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,590
Wise ponies may say the folks
that come here are customers,

54
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,153
but I can't help
but thinkin'

55
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:30,529
of each and every
one of you as friends.

56
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,581
That's why there's a three-for-
one special on apple fritters

57
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:38,461
in the cafe for the next
hour. Enjoy! Uh-huh-huh.

58
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:43,649
Would you two like to
take a tour of the place?

59
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,636
I'm just about to
do my rounds

60
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,252
and check on my
friends who work here.

61
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,544
We do have a friendship
problem to find.

62
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,141
Lead the way, Mr. Gladmane.

63
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,147
Just Gladmane,
now, you hear?

64
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,566
AH! Gladmane! You're just in
time to see my newest move!

65
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:08,227
New moves or not, I'm glad
to have a star like you

66
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:10,160
working for me,
I'll-tell-you-what.

67
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,575
Oh, don't make me
blush. Now watch this!

68
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,920
Stellar, ah-huh-huh!

69
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,886
Hon-hon, Monsieur Gladmane
himself is here.

70
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,923
Let's run through
the whole routine!

71
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,507
Now, don't make a
fuss for ol' me.

72
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,658
I'm just gonna keep on giving
a tour to my new friends,

73
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:33,015
Applejack and Fluttershy.

74
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,732
Hi.
Howdy.

75
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:37,150
If this pony
calls you friend,

76
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,483
you're welcome
backstage anytime.

77
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:42,258
I owe him my
entire career.

78
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:45,846
Oh shucks. Well, let's leave
the artists to their work.

79
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:49,667
Doesn't look like there's any
friendship problems here.

80
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:54,295
I've never seen a pink
prairie dog before.

81
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,009
I like the folks
that come here

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,913
to have a unique
experience, uh-huh-huh.

83
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,864
And we love him for it.

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,276
With Gladmane's help,

85
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:08,855
we've been able to take care
of all these little guys.

86
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:11,932
Now this place is
overwhelming in a good way.

87
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:15,156
Oh, glad you like it.

88
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,246
Fluttershy?

89
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,550
Hmm? Oh, um. Coming.

90
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:25,692
There doesn't seem
to be anything wrong

91
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,935
around here at all.

92
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,089
I figured looking for
a friendship problem

93
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:31,636
in Las Pegasus would be like
trying to find a needle

94
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,953
in a stack of needles,

95
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:35,347
but everypony seems to be
getting along just fine.

96
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,316
<i> Ladies and gentleponies,</i>

97
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:39,704
<i> despite what my</i>
<i> competition might say,</i>

98
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,332
<i> I know you've come to this</i>
<i> fair city to be entertained,</i>

99
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,138
and I assure you

100
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,156
there is nothing more
entertaining than the

101
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:48,455
astounding acrobatics in
Gladmane's Poné Fantastique!

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,501
Oh, I suppose that might be true
if it weren't for the existence,

103
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,963
and far superiorly
entertaining presence,

104
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,270
of the show-stopping
exotic animal act

105
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:58,966
that Poné Fantastique includes!

106
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,372
Those voices
sound familiar.

107
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:03,193
They sure do.

108
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:05,476
Flim and Flam.

109
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:08,756
Why, I won't even dignify that
assertion with a response,

110
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,452
except to say that if you were
to consider buying your tickets

111
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:14,603
from me, I might consider
offering them to you

112
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:16,036
at a substantial discount.

113
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:18,356
I have always thought
you get what you pay for

114
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,747
and in my humble opinion,

115
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,476
these tickets are a
value at twice the price!

116
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:27,501
Don't let this price-gouging
charlatan take you for a ride!

117
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:32,369
Charlatan!?
How dare you?!

118
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:33,803
Ha! How dare I?

119
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,246
Yes, how dare you.
I call them
like I see them

120
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:40,055
Well, they certainly don't
seem to be getting along.

121
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,160
You don't suppose we've
been brought here to help them?

122
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:47,144
Absolutely not!

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,987
I know you and the rest
of the Apple Family

124
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:00,646
have had your issues with
Flim and Flam in the past,

125
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,861
but they're definitely
having trouble

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,163
and solving a friendship
problem is important,

127
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,009
no matter who's
having it.

128
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,526
Well, of course
that's true.

129
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:12,129
For anypony but them!

130
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:17,686
I'm sorry you had to see
that. I don't know why,

131
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:20,270
but those two've been fightin'
ever since they got here.

132
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,750
I thought giving them
these jobs might help,

133
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,206
but I guess it just
made matters worse.

134
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:27,606
Trust me; I know
those ponies

135
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,372
and you're better off
with them apart.

136
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,483
The two of them together
will cheat the hooves

137
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:32,689
right out from under you.

138
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:36,596
I suppose you're right.
Flim's such a showpony

139
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:39,298
and Flam has such a
head for business.

140
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,329
Why, if they ever
did work together,

141
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,889
they'd be runnin' this
place in two shakes.

142
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,996
Speaking of which, I
better get back to work.

143
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,538
Y'all enjoy your
stay now, ya hear?

144
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,716
I'm pretty sure we should
help Flim and Flam.

145
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,298
And I'm pretty sure there's
another friendship problem here

146
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:00,676
and I'm gonna search this resort
top to bottom till I find it.

147
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:06,276
I hope you didn't travel
all the way from Ponyville

148
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:09,784
to try to get me to reconcile
with my no-account brother!

149
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:13,920
Brother? I don't believe
I have one of those.

150
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,867
Oh, I already know
what he thinks of me,

151
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,101
all show and
no substance.

152
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:22,270
Well, if he's so smart,
he should have no trouble

153
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,916
becoming a big
success on his own!

154
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:30,018
Why, he's the greatest salespony
that ever lived, of course!

155
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,433
Just ask him; he'll
tell you all about it!

156
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,907
I'm sure you could work
out your differences

157
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,603
if you just sat down and
talked to each other.

158
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,636
I'm never speaking
to that pony again!

159
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,775
<i> NO! You are</i>
<i> ruining my show!</i>

160
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,375
It isn't just your show
and I'm improving it!

161
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,098
You don't pull a rabbit
out of a hat on a trapeze!

162
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,646
That's the point!
To give the audience

163
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:12,590
something they've never seen
before: acrobatic magic!

164
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:17,187
<i> ♪ TA DA. ♪</i>

165
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,098
It's called "blending
genres" and it's AWESOME!

166
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,246
Shouldn't somepony do something?

167
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:29,809
Ha! They've been doing this
since they started working here.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,775
Too bad, really. If they ever
stopped shouting at each other,

169
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:34,313
we could take the show on tour.

170
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:37,975
They'd be way more successful
than staying at Gladmane's.

171
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,723
Now, that sounds like a
real friendship problem!

172
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,750
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

173
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,372
<i> Stop! What are</i>
<i> you doing?</i>

174
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,141
It's supposed to be a
Pink Prairie Dog Pyramid.

175
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,335
It's alliterative!

176
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:58,744
You said a tower! Why do you
keep changing everything?!

177
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:02,775
I'm not changing anything.
You said pyramid!

178
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:08,689
ARGHHH! You are
driving me crazy!

179
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:12,400
I thought you
two got along.

180
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,649
We used to.

181
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:16,627
But we just can't seem to
agree on anything anymore.

182
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:20,375
We used to perform
all over Equestria,

183
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:22,024
but if we can't
agree on a new act,

184
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,615
we might as well stay
at Gladmane's forever.

185
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:33,113
Two friendship problems in the
same theater? Now we're talking!

186
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,264
If you count Flim and Flam,

187
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:40,024
that's three big friendship
problems all in the same place.

188
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,969
Well, I don't
count Flim and Flam

189
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,523
since those two not being
friends isn't a problem.

190
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,406
It certainly isn't
for Gladmane.

191
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,701
It sounds like he's better
off with them fighting.

192
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:51,760
Actually, the other
ponies' problems

193
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,876
seem to be good
for Gladmane too.

194
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:57,476
Both the trapeze show and the
animal act would be better off

195
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:01,150
if they left, but everypony is
so busy arguing that they can't.

196
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,040
Do you think he knows?

197
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:06,935
I don't know. But I'm starting
to think we should find out.

198
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:11,396
Of course, Gladmane wants
everypony to get along!

199
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:15,421
He's the nicest, most
genuine pony I've ever met.

200
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,280
Did the director
put you up to this?

201
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,664
I tell you, if Gladmane
is your friend,

202
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:24,996
you are welcome backstage,

203
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:29,446
but if you are speaking
of him poorly, you leave!

204
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:34,123
Gladmane is the
kindest, most gentle...

205
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,347
...most compassionate
pony I've ever known.

206
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,264
My problem is with him!

207
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,261
I just can't figure it.

208
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,775
The only pony who benefits from
all this feudin' is Gladmane,

209
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,695
but by all accounts
he's the best friend

210
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:52,006
any of these
ponies have.

211
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,920
Well, Bernard, that adorable
bunny from the acrobat's hat,

212
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:59,415
claims that every morning,
Gladmane tells the director

213
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:01,366
that the star wants
control of the show.

214
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:03,458
And every afternoon
tells the star

215
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,415
that the director wants to get
rid of her. But neither is true.

216
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,661
And the Flying Prairinos,
the Pink Prairie Dog family,

217
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,747
say Gladmane keeps
changing their act

218
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:16,584
to make each trainer think
the other is doing it.

219
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,409
So, all his talk
about friendship

220
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,058
is just a load of
apple sauce.

221
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:23,581
He's gettin' them all to fight
with each other on purpose!

222
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,409
But how can we get everypony to
believe that's what he's doing?

223
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:30,732
There must be a way to trick
him into telling the truth.

224
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,230
Gee, if only
there was a pony

225
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:35,360
who knew how to
trick a trickster.

226
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,806
Or maybe, a pair
of ponies.

227
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:47,083
Fine. I guess bringing
Flim and Flam back together

228
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,298
might be why we're
here. Maybe.

229
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:57,593
Sorry if I don't take the word
of some pony off the street.

230
00:12:57,686 --> 00:13:00,713
Even if that street
is in Ponyville.

231
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:03,716
But Gladmane is behind so many
other friendship problems,

232
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:06,498
how can you be sure he
isn't the cause of yours?

233
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:10,904
Because the only problem I
have is standing right there.

234
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,966
Same here, buster.

235
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,686
Do either of you even know
what you're fighting over?

236
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,338
Gladmane let me know
that ex-brother of mine

237
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,667
thinks I'm just a mouthpiece
without a single good idea.

238
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,827
Gladmane assured me this
former, fraternal foal here

239
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,830
thinks I couldn't sell
heat lamps to yaks.

240
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,556
Sounds to me like neither
of you said those things.

241
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,024
Why'd you believe Gladmane
when he said you did?

242
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,483
Why would he lie?

243
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,049
Because he's afraid that
the two of you together

244
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,578
could move in and
take over his resort.

245
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:42,596
And if I'm telling
you he said it,

246
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:45,009
you know it's the
absolute truth because...

247
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,581
You never lie!

248
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:51,981
Oh, brother of mine, I think
it's time for a little payback.

249
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,298
The "Canterlot Two-step?"

250
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:56,830
We don't have the chickens. How
about the "Baltimare Flare"?

251
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,504
Uh, my flare isn't
what it used to be.

252
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,123
Listen here, y'all.

253
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,086
If you're a friend of
mine, you're entitled

254
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,600
to a free night's stay.

255
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:07,218
And everypony here's a
friend of mine! Thank you.

256
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:08,689
Thank you very much.

257
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:10,387
Are you thinking
what I am?

258
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,910
The "High
Roller Hustle"!

259
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,732
The what now?

260
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:18,030
Trust us, when we're done,
there won't be a pony in town

261
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,061
who doesn't know the
Applejackiest truth

262
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:21,040
about Gladmane.

263
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:24,313
That is, assuming you
two are willing to help.

264
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,153
What size gown
do you wear?

265
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,218
What's all the fuss, now?

266
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,661
It's the grand-matriarch of the
Rich family, Impossibly Rich.

267
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:40,529
She's one of the wealthiest
ponies in Equestria.

268
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,236
Well, why didn't
somepony tell me?

269
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,581
You know how I like to give
VIP guests my personal touch.

270
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,944
Well, she's not
exactly a guest.

271
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,818
Word is she's planning
a resort of her own.

272
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,461
I think she's here to
scout the competition.

273
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,713
Oh, really?

274
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:02,141
And with her bits, she could
take over the whole strip,

275
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:04,553
hire away anypony
she wants.

276
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:08,073
Not me, of course.
I love it here.

277
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,436
My good-for-nothing
brother on the other hoof.

278
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:16,036
Pfft. Impossibly Rich! What
an honor it is to have you

279
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,430
at my humble
five-hoof resort!

280
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:21,015
I'm sure Flam has
done an excellent job

281
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,236
showing you around,
but nothing could beat

282
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:27,316
a personalized tour from The
Mane himself! Ah-huh-huh?

283
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:32,843
You'll have to excuse Ms.
Rich, she saves the energy

284
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,095
other ponies spend talking
out loud and uses it

285
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,720
to make more money.

286
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:42,627
She'd love a personal tour,
say, in uh, about an hour?

287
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,193
Well, that sounds
right pleasant.

288
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,018
And if you can break
away for a moment, Flam,

289
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:51,649
I'd love to see you in my
office so I can get ready.

290
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,892
Are all of you sure
this is a good idea?

291
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,338
Abso-tively!

292
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:03,673
Gladmane is one fish
that's hooked but good.

293
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,704
I sure hope you two
know what you're doing.

294
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,458
Oh don't you worry.

295
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:10,326
When it comes to throwing
ponies off their game...

296
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:12,473
...no two ponies do
it better than us.

297
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:14,701
I can't argue with that.

298
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,600
Hey there boss, Impossibly
Rich is just about ready

299
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:24,516
for that tour. So what did
you wanna see me about?

300
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:27,643
Actually, there's something
I want you to see.

301
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:32,769
The grand plan: Every hotel on
the strip as amazin' as this one

302
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,200
and every one of them mine.

303
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:40,609
And all it'll take is a little
salesponyship. Like this.

304
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:43,323
Hey there, friends, ah-huh-huh!

305
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,895
If you think my
resort is fantastic,

306
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:49,267
wait till you see
Poné Fantastique.

307
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:53,138
Tickets are on sale now.
Two for the price of one.

308
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:55,495
Thank you. Thank
you very much.

309
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,455
Now I know Impossibly
Rich has probably

310
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:00,978
made you a tempting offer
to come work for her.

311
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,006
Well, now that
you mention it...

312
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,286
And as your friend, I'd
never tell you what to do,

313
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,061
but no pony is gonna stand
in the way of my plans,

314
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,550
no matter how rich she is.

315
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:14,916
And I sure wouldn't want you
to end up on the losing side.

316
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:17,243
Think you might
consider staying here?

317
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,320
Yeah.

318
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,289
Well, all right, then.

319
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:25,304
They're coming!

320
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:31,126
And last, but not least, Ms.
Rich, the jewel in my crown.

321
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,947
Impossibly wants you to
know she's very impressed.

322
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,861
But doesn't think
you can keep a resort

323
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,830
of this calibre
going for long.

324
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,843
Oh, and why is that?

325
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,710
Because you've got the best
talent in the industry.

326
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:52,043
What stops them from just
leaving to join any competitor?

327
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,464
Well, you see,
I have a trick for that,

328
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:57,126
I must confess, ah-huh-huh.

329
00:17:57,372 --> 00:18:01,421
And it all has to do with
how I handle my employees.

330
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,027
And how is that?

331
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:07,323
Well... LIKE FRIENDS, of course!

332
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:10,080
And I treat every
one of my employees

333
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,387
with the kindness
they deserve!

334
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:15,593
Oh. That's it?
THAT'S your secret?

335
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,793
There's nothing else?

336
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:21,310
Nope. Just friendship.

337
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:23,975
But you know all about
friendship, don't you...

338
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,418
FLUTTERSHY?

339
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,040
You knew the whole time?

340
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,501
Never try to con a con-pony!
Uh-huh-huh!

341
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:42,615
I'd have thought you'd
hit the road by now.

342
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,886
Whether we were able
to fool you or not,

343
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,704
you can't just go on keeping
ponies from getting along.

344
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:49,815
It's just mean!

345
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,520
Now maybe it is, but it's
a meanness that works,

346
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:56,350
unlike your pathetic
little ploy.

347
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,332
I practically invented
the "High Roller Hustle."

348
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,978
But I suppose I
should be impressed.

349
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,575
You're the only ponies to
ever figure out the secret

350
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:06,529
to my success.

351
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:09,476
It takes a lot of work
keepin' everypony fightin',

352
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:12,830
but as long as I keep 'em
convinced I'm their only friend,

353
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,920
all of Las Pegasus will be mine.

354
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:19,532
Oh, you can't trick a confession
out of a pony like me.

355
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,233
I am always one step ahead.

356
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,824
Well, you better
check your hooves.

357
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:27,556
Because... you've just
stepped in a confession.

358
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:31,544
Oh no. Oh no. Wait, wait.

359
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,341
Did that sound OK?

360
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,723
Never better!

361
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:38,375
Flim and Flam told us
you'd see right through

362
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,953
the fake rich pony bit.
And that once you did,

363
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:43,378
you wouldn't be able to
resist gloating about it.

364
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,396
This was all part of the plan.

365
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:50,104
Oh now, now friends! Listen
I can explain everything!

366
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,732
I think you've done
enough of that.

367
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,815
Darling?

368
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:59,409
Oh! I cannot believe we let him
almost ruin our friendship.

369
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:02,978
And our act. Good luck
finding another one.

370
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,510
Wait! No! Y'all COME BACK!
C'mon I'm gonna be ruined!

371
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:12,572
This is Gladmane, y'all!
C'mon you can't do this!

372
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,135
Gladmane has left
the building!

373
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:22,750
I guess the map wasn't
on the fritz after all.

374
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,033
If it weren't for your
history with Flim and Flam,

375
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,520
you never would have be
so determined to find

376
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,676
somepony else to help

377
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:33,403
and we never would have found
out what Gladmane was doing.

378
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:35,784
And if it weren't for you
wanting to show even those

379
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:37,409
two con ponies kindness,

380
00:20:37,507 --> 00:20:40,018
we never would have been
able to trick the trickster.

381
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,756
It must've felt pretty
nice to finally put

382
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,790
all your connivin' and
cheatin' skills to good use.

383
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,086
In fact, we like to think of it

384
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:50,603
as a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

385
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,578
Emphasis on the "once."

386
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,335
What do you mean?

387
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:59,680
While this establishment
undergoes a slight change

388
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:02,707
in management, my brother
and I want to assure you

389
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:05,969
that it remains the pinnacle
of Las Pegasus entertainment.

390
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,630
Which is why we invite
each and every one of you

391
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:14,436
to experience the wonder of
the Poné Fantastique Theater

392
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,360
at half the normal
cost of admission.

393
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,018
And, while you're appreciating
this historic venue,

394
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,913
totally devoid of
performers of any kind,

395
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,812
we invite you to use the wonder
of your own imaginations

396
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:28,369
to fill the space at
no additional charge!

397
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:32,547
FLIM AND FLAM!!
