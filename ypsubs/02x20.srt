1
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:05,872
I made it for you, Rarity.

2
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:09,703
Why yes, it is an ice cream house.

3
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:14,375
Chocolate fudge shingles...
Rocky road garage...

4
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,051
Twilight?

5
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:23,375
Oh, hi Spike.

6
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:26,775
It's the middle of the night!
Why are you pacing like this?

7
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:29,739
Frankly, I don't know how you
can sleep at a time like this!

8
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:31,490
Three AM?

9
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:34,975
It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!

10
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:38,275
I don't understand.
What's wrong?

11
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,875
Here.
Now do you see what's wrong?

12
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:44,229
You forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?

13
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,008
No, the problem is I just finished
planning my schedule for the month,

14
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,858
but I forgot to leave time to plan
for next month!

15
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:52,275
Don't you see?

16
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,985
There's no time in my schedule
to put together another schedule!

17
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,000
I could move my meeting with
the Ponyville Hay Board

18
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,175
to the following Tuesday,

19
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:00,625
but then I have to reschedule
my lunch with Pinkie Pie.

20
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,745
And you know what a nightmare
she is with scheduling.

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,593
This is an absolute disaster.
My whole year could be thrown off!

22
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:09,575
And I woke up from
an ice cream dream for this...

23
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:16,514

26
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,703
Oh my gosh, I think I did it!

27
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:57,533
If I can find a way to read
The Art of Invisibility Spells,

28
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,496
and Farmhill's A Brief History of Canterlot
at the same time,

29
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:03,061
that could leave me
a half-hour scheduling window!

30
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,288
What's going on?

31
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,575
Twilight,

32
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:30,975
you've got to listen to me!

33
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:31,877
Who are you?

34
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:34,225
I mean, you're me, but I'm me too.

35
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,555
How can there be two 'me's?

36
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:36,875
It's not scientifically possible.

37
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,933
You are not scientifically possible!

38
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,655
Twilight, please!

39
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:42,378
I have a very important message
for you from the future!

40
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,345
You're from the future?!

41
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:45,646
That's right, now listen-

42
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:48,995
What happened to you?
The future must be awful.

43
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:50,775
Please! I don't have much time!

44
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,775
Is there some sort of epic pony war
in the distant future or something?

45
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,775
Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning.
But that's not important right now!

46
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:59,701
I can't believe
time travel's really possible!

47
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:02,511
How did you, I mean, I
figure it out?

48
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,625
The time spells are in
the Canterlot archives.

49
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,225
- But that's not-
- Really? Where?

50
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,266
I've never seen them.

51
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,314
They're in the
Star Swirl the Bearded wing.

52
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,375
- Now, you have to listen to me.
- Is time travel fun, or does it hurt?

53
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,876
I have so many questions-

54
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:17,426
I have something extremely important
to tell you about the future.

55
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:19,892
I only have a few seconds,
so you've got to listen!

56
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:21,425
Whatever you do, don't-

57
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,303
Future Twilight? Oh no!

58
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,214
What was she trying to warn me about?

59
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:30,317
Her clothes, her mane, that scar...

60
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:31,980
What a mess she is!

61
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:35,143
I mean, I am... or I... will be...

62
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:39,453
She must want me to prevent whatever
horrible thing happens in the future!

63
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:47,003
C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start
until the party supplies get there!

64
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:51,273
Happy to... help... but...

65
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,848
Can I carry... the balloons next time?

66
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:02,103
Listen, everypony! I've got
something really important to say!

67
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:10,753
This is no laughing matter!
We have a crisis on our hooves!

68
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:14,883
I've just been visited
by myself from the future!

69
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:20,479
This isn't a joke!

70
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,348
My future self tried to warn me
about a horrible disaster,

71
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:26,173
that's gonna occur sometime
before next Tuesday morning!

72
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:27,473
What kind of disaster?

73
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:28,603
I don't know!

74
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:31,443
I got sucked back into the future
before I could explain!

75
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:35,162
Run for your liiife!

76
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:37,583
Whatever should we do, Twilight?

77
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:40,779
How do we stop a disaster
if we don't know what it is?

78
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,483
We'll just have to work together
to make sure we're safe.

79
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:47,683
Rainbow Dash, you and the other pegasi
spread out over Equestria

80
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,403
and look for any kind of problem
that could lead to a disaster.

81
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:52,333
And I mean anything.

82
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:53,503
You got it!

83
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:55,453
Everypony else...

84
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,710
Anypony else wanna panic with me?

85
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:02,861
No?

86
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:09,422
Everypony else,
time to disaster proof Equestria!

87
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:35,846
Eeyup.

88
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,439
Done, and done, and done.

89
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:57,963
Applejack,
what about the Everfree Forest?

90
00:05:58,114 --> 00:05:59,114
The perimeter's clear.

91
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:00,065
Great.

92
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:03,869
And my team gave the all clear
from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.

93
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,903
Excellent.

94
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:07,560
Well, we've done everything on the list.

95
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:09,303
But still...

96
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:12,773
Future Twilight looked like
she'd been through a horrible ordeal.

97
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:15,853
I just have this nagging feeling
we should be looking for something bigger

98
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,008
than loose bolts and leaky pipes.

99
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:27,753
Okay, everypony.
Follow my lead.

100
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,352
- What is that thing?
- That's Cerberus!

101
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:39,953
He's supposed to be guarding
the gates of Tartarus.

102
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:43,353
But if he's here, then all the ancient evil
creatures that have been imprisoned there

103
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,433
could escape and destroy Equestria!

104
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:48,623
- Destroy Equestria?!
- Yeah, isn't it great?

105
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:52,773
Hey, Cerberus! You look like
you could use some obedience training!

106
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:55,089
Magic obedience training!

107
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:03,363
Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?

108
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:07,203
Wow, I knew you were good with animals,
but this is amazing.

109
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:12,108
Aw, he's just a big furry guy
who got out of his yard, that's all.

110
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,259
Right, Cerberus?

111
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,453
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

112
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,703
- Pinkie.
- Yes, Twilight?

113
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:22,174
Do you have a ball I can borrow?

114
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,203
I have balls stashed all over Ponyville.
In case of ball emergency.

115
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:28,673
Hey, Cerberus!

116
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:32,553
Look what I have!

117
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:35,983
I'll be back as soon as I've returned him
to the gates of Tartarus.

118
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:38,753
Once he's back at home,
there'll be no disaster.

119
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:50,958
I wish Twilight would go on
epic adventures more often.

120
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,753
Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.

121
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:57,763
Hey Twilight.
How'd it go with Cerberus?

122
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:02,303
Great! I got him back before any
of the evil creatures could escape.

123
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:06,760
Oh no!

124
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,223
What's the big deal,
it's just a 'lost dog' flyer.

125
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,853
I guess the Princess hasn't heard
we found Cerberus yet.

126
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:15,564
It's not that,
it's this!

127
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,453
A paper cut...?

128
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,853
Come on, Twilight,
you really need to toughen up.

129
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:22,432
Just clean it out and you'll be fine.

130
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,603
The cut's in the exact same spot
as the scar on future Twilight's cheek!

131
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:28,764
We haven't changed the future at all!

132
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,976
The disaster is still coming!

133
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:36,059
If the disaster wasn't caused
by Cerberus getting loose,

134
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,756
then what could it possibly be?

135
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:42,576
I dunno, but maybe you ought
to give the pacing a rest.

136
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:44,356
You've worn a groove into the floor!

137
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,706
I don't have time for another one
of your lectures, Spike!

138
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:47,857
This is serious!

139
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,556
My lectures?

140
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:52,506
I did everything I could think of
to change the future.

141
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,557
But it didn't work.

142
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:56,756
So maybe it's not what I do...

143
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,106
Maybe it's what I don't do!

144
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:04,856
If I stand right here and don't
move a muscle until next Tuesday,

145
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,226
I can't possibly do whatever it is

146
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:08,656
that future Twilight wanted
to warn me not to do!

147
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,606
Really?

148
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:16,656
So... no matter what happens,
you're not gonna move a muscle, huh?

149
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,056
Then maybe you won't mind if I...

150
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,286
eat an entire tub of ice cream!

151
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,845
So good!

152
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:40,156
Spike, stop!
Think of the stomach ache!

153
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,506
Stomach ache, huh?

154
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:44,670
That's future Spike's problem.

155
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:49,456
Hey, Twilight!

156
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,406
Another pegasus just got back
from Baltimare with an all-clear and-

157
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:58,056
What's going on?
Aren't you gonna stop him?

158
00:09:58,207 --> 00:09:59,176
She sure isn't!

159
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,656
In fact, she's not gonna move
'til next Tuesday!

160
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:04,806
She thinks it'll prevent
the disaster from happening!

161
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,828
Oh, this is too rich.

162
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:11,106
Hey Twilight!
There's a mouse right behind you!

163
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,656
Wait, wait, wait, let me try!

164
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:32,131
Oh no!

165
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,382
What happened?

166
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:38,436
I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to!
It was a total accident!

167
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:39,616
Show me.

168
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,417
I'm not so sure that's a-

169
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:43,306
Show me!

170
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:49,906
Oh no! This is the same
mane cut as future Twilight!

171
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:54,006
Y'know...
It really doesn't look too bad...

172
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:55,687
I don't care how it looks!

173
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:58,326
It's just another sign
that the future hasn't changed!

174
00:10:58,477 --> 00:11:01,067
Not doing anything didn't work either!

175
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:04,806
I wish there was a way to know what
was going to happen so I could stop it!

176
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,778
You wanna see the future?

177
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:10,706
I might know somepony who can help!

178
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:12,636
What's this?

179
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:14,056
It's Madame Pinkie's place.

180
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,656
Madame Pinkie?

181
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:22,456
Come... enter the chamber
of Madame Pinkie Pie...

182
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:30,356
For the answers you seek, let us consult
the mystical orb of fate's destiny...

183
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,186
Do you like
my mystical orb of fate's destiny?

184
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,451
I just got it. Cool, huh?

185
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:38,536
Yeah, uh... best one I've seen.

186
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:45,036
Look deep into the crystal ball...
For soon it will reveal all!

187
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:48,056
Ah yes, I see something...

188
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,656
It's a vision of the future...

189
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:54,656
I see you, Twilight.

190
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,406
You will get...

191
00:11:56,556 --> 00:12:00,389
a really cool birthday present next year!

192
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,636
Yes, and?

193
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:02,906
That's it.

194
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,357
Are you sure?

195
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,316
Yep. Cool birthday present.

196
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,416
Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense
to tell me what the impending

197
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,101
disaster is that future Twilight
was trying to warn me about!

198
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:16,156
Oh, my fortune telling has nothing to do
with my Pinkie Sense, silly.

199
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:18,754
It's only good for vague
and immediate events.

200
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:22,336
Like that, see?

201
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:24,454
Where did that even come from?

202
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:32,556
Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight
since the flowerpot incident.

203
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:34,007
Hope she still isn't mad.

204
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,220
Off by point zero two from yesterday.

205
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:42,641
Carry the fifteen...

206
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:45,056
Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...

207
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:46,207
Hey Pinkie.

208
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:48,223
Twilight's really serious about finding out

209
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,606
about that cool birthday present, isn't she?

210
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:54,092
Who cares?
As long as I can keep eating ice cream.

211
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:55,643
Sorry, future Spike.

212
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,838
Are you okay?

213
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:02,466
Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here.

214
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,212
Can you help me recalibrate the apertures

215
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,428
on the nine and quarter
catadioptric telescopes?

216
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:07,579
Sure!

217
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,556
So I was thinking...

218
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:11,712
After I came to see Madame Pinkie
and the flowerpot landed on my head,

219
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:13,836
see the bandage, just like
the bandage from the future...

220
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:14,987
Nice.

221
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:17,480
I had an epiphany after that flowerpot.

222
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,406
Doing things didn't work,
not doing things didn't work.

223
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,885
And I couldn't predict the future either,
so I only had one other choice...

224
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,707
Monitor everything.

225
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,258
Makes sense to me!

226
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,320
That way no matter what happens
in the future, I'll be ready!

227
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:33,476
I thought I saw something last night
in the Horsehead nebula.

228
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,406
But after staring at it
for three straight hours,

229
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:36,957
I realized I was wrong!

230
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,175
Three hours? But when did you sleep?

231
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:41,706
Oh I didn't sleep. I haven't slept
since future Twilight was here.

232
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:43,493
There are only three days
left until next Tuesday,

233
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:45,306
I can sleep all I want after that!

234
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,639
You've been awake too long, Twilight.

235
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,082
Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now.

236
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:51,733
Tuesday's tomorrow!

237
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,814
Pinkie, did you finish
recalibrating the apertures

238
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:58,116
on the nine and quarter inch
catadioptric telescopes?

239
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:00,106
I have no idea!

240
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:04,530
Ah! My eye!

241
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,946
Don't worry, Twilight,
I have eye patches stashed

242
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,888
all over Ponyville,
in case of eye patch emergency.

243
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,874
There! Now you look like a pirate.

244
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,856
A sleepy pirate,
with a really weird mane cut.

245
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:17,523
The eye patch...! Another sign!

246
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:20,356
Nearly all the signs have come true!

247
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:22,306
I haven't done a thing
to prevent the catastrophe!

248
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,201
If Tuesday's tomorrow,

249
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:26,021
and the disaster happens
by Tuesday morning,

250
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:27,606
then there's only one solution.

251
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,323
I'll just have to...

252
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:31,776
stop time!

253
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:44,247
Okay, the Canterlot archives
are right over there.

254
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:45,448
Let's move!

255
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,682
I don't think we need
to sneak around, Twilight.

256
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,067
It's not illegal
to walk around Canterlot.

257
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:00,218
Guard!

258
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:03,267
C'mon, you guys!

259
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:10,787
That was close.

260
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:13,747
I dunno why we have
to wear these things, either.

261
00:15:13,898 --> 00:15:15,607
Aren't we wearing them for fun?

262
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:18,089
No, there's nothing fun about this!

263
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,737
- Are you sure?
- Focus, guys!

264
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,413
The only way to prevent this disaster
is to stop time!

265
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:26,888
Time spells are kept in
the Star Swirl the Bearded wing,

266
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,817
the most secure section of the archives.

267
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:30,575
That's why we're sneaking around!

268
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:33,037
Awesome!
That sounds fun!

269
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:34,987
No, it's not fun!

270
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:41,054
I still don't understand
how sneaking into the archives

271
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:43,987
is gonna help her find out
about her birthday present.

272
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:49,507
The coast is clear.

273
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,210
Now slowly lift me into the window
so we can- AH!

274
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:58,249
Let's get this over with.

275
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:24,152
Okay, if my calculations are correct,
the Star Swirl the Bearded wing

276
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:26,103
should be right... here.

277
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:27,754
Uh, Twilight?

278
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:28,705
What is it, Spike?

279
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,267
Isn't this where we came in?

280
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:32,240
Cool! Can we climb in the window again?

281
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,691
That was super fun!

282
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:37,192
I don't understand.
It's supposed to be right here...

283
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:39,029
How are we supposed to find it now?

284
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,575
Maybe we should ask somepony
in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?

285
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:45,548
Huh. How'd I miss that?

286
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:48,622
Look at all those
priceless magic scrolls...

287
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,147
There are more than I ever imagined!

288
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:52,887
Twilight, the guard!

289
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:57,347
What do we do, what do we do?!

290
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:07,299
Hey, Twilight,
 haven't seen you in a while.

291
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,450
Let me open that for ya.

292
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:12,930
Thanks!

293
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:15,363
Oh no!

294
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:19,341
Look! I look just like future Twilight.

295
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,287
The last sign has come true!

296
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,687
And that's bad, right?

297
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:24,538
Come on!

298
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,867
It's almost Tuesday morning!
The disaster could happen at any moment!

299
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:31,947
But how do we find
the time-stopping spell?

300
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:33,999
There must be a million scrolls here!

301
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,717
I. Don't. Know!

302
00:17:56,787 --> 00:18:00,237
Twilight, it's over!
It's officially Tuesday morning!

303
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,388
No!

304
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,377
Tuesday morning, the disaster!

305
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,178
Incoming!

306
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:13,849
I dunno, Twilight.
I don't see any disasters.

307
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,707
It looks like a pretty nice day.

308
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,981
Good morning, Twilight,
love the new hairstyle.

309
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,232
Well, happy Tuesday!

310
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:25,295
Why isn't anypony surprised
to see me sneaking around in here?!

311
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,764
Is it possible
there never was a disaster?

312
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:32,117
That I've just been making myself
frantic over nothing?!

313
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:34,070
I don't get it.

314
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,700
If future Twilight wasn't
warning you about a disaster,

315
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:38,654
then what was she trying to tell you?

316
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:44,187
I don't know. But I do know one thing.

317
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:46,592
I look ridiculous!

318
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,891
Yeah, you do!

319
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,862
And it's all because
I couldn't stop worrying

320
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:53,092
and let the future handle itself!

321
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,943
Well, not any more.

322
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:57,766
From now on, I'm gonna
solve problems as they come.

323
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,396
And stop worrying about
every little thing!

324
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:01,547
That's great!

325
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:04,087
Does that mean there won't be
any more late night pacing?

326
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:06,055
No more late night pacing.

327
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:08,587
If only I had learned
this lesson a week ago,

328
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:10,561
we wouldn't have had
to go through all this.

329
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:12,751
Twilight, Twilight, I found something!

330
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:16,504
It doesn't stop time,
but it lets you go back in time.

331
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,854
It says you can go back once,
and it only lasts for a few moments.

332
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:21,105
Does that help?

333
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:23,937
Pinkie, you're a genius!

334
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:28,232
Now I can go back and tell past Twilight
that she doesn't need to go berserk

335
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,657
with worry about a disaster
that's never gonna come!

336
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:40,395
Twilight,

337
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,695
you've got to listen to me!

338
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:42,697
Who are you?

339
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:45,045
I mean, you're me, but I'm me too.

340
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,375
How can there be two 'me's?

341
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:47,695
It's not scientifically possible.

342
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:49,753
You are not scientifically possible!

343
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:50,475
Twilight, please!

344
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,198
I have a very important message
for you from the future!

345
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,165
You're from the future?!

346
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:56,466
That's right, now listen-

347
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:59,815
What happened to you?
The future must be awful.

348
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,595
Please! I don't have much time!

349
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:04,595
Is there some sort of epic pony war
in the distant future or something?

350
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,595
Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning.
But that's not important right now!

351
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:10,521
I can't believe
time travel's really possible!

352
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:13,331
How did you, I mean, I figure it out?

353
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,445
The time spells are in
the Canterlot archives.

354
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:17,045
- But that's not-
- Really? Where?

355
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:18,086
I've never seen them.

356
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:20,134
They're in the
Star Swirl the Bearded wing.

357
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:23,195
- Now, you have to listen to me.
- Is time travel fun, or does it hurt?

358
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:24,696
I have so many questions-

359
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:28,246
I have something extremely important
to tell you about the future.

360
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,712
I only have a few seconds,
so you've got to listen!

361
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,245
Whatever you do, don't...

362
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,557
waste your time... worrying... about...

363
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:40,027
I can't believe I just did that.

364
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:42,717
Did you tell her about
the cool birthday present?

365
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,968
Remember last week when future Twilight
came to warn me about something?

366
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:50,107
That was me trying to warn myself
not to worry so much!

367
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:53,775
Now I'm gonna spend the next week
freaking out about a disaster

368
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:55,326
that doesn't even exist!

369
00:20:56,887 --> 00:21:00,556
Don't worry about it.
It's past Twilight's problem now.

370
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,554
Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie.

371
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:07,307
Oh... my stomach...

372
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:11,511
I think it's all that ice cream...

373
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:15,887
I thought the stomach ache
would be future Spike's problem...

374
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:19,027
But now I am future Spike.

375
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:25,837
Come on, future Spike.

376
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:29,357
Let's get you home.
