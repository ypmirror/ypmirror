Today we have two
special guests

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,090
with a very special
announcement.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,680
Everypony, welcome the Head
of the Equestria Games,

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,040
Ms. Harshwhinny.

6

<i>(door opens)</i>
Ms. Harshwhinny.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,930
Thank you.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,410
Now I'm sure you all
know about the Equestria Games,

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,910
where ponies from all over
the land compete for glory

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,100
in various athletic pursuits?

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,380
Well, now you littlest ones will
have the chance to compete

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,330
for a weighty responsibility
of your very own.

13

<i>Tell them the fun part!</i>

<i>(Ooh and aah from the others)</i>

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,160
That's right!

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,780
All you gotta do is show
Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest,

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,400
most spectacular,
most rockin' routine

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,270
and you're goin' to
the Games!

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,020
So, who's gonna be
the lucky ponies?

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,970
It's got to be me.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,530
Maybe it's me.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,330
Maybe it's us!

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,300

Oh, you are gonna LOVE this!

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,970
<i>Ms. Harshwinny: Miss Dash!</i>

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,190
Will you please curb
your overenthusiastic outbursts!

33
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,880
Now then, let me be
clear on the rules.

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,630
You ponies will form teams.

35
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,020
<i>Each team will create</i>
<i>their own flag-carrying routine.</i>

36
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,980
<i>Everypony will be judged on</i>
<i>grace, style, and originality.</i>

37
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,340
There's a most complicated
scoring system,

38
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,620
which I will elaborate
upon now. Firstly...

39
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,630
Aw, Get to the
nitty gritty later.

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,970
Tell them the important
stuff: like who's the coach?

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,470
<i>(whistle blast)</i>

42
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,610
That's right: ME!

43
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,310
And you know why I'm
qualified to coach you?

44
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,500
Guess who carried the
Cloudsdale flag in the Games

45
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,100
when she was a little filly.

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,160
ME!

47
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,080
I'll never forget it.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,180
I burst into the stadium...

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,820
spreading my wings,
the flag flapping in the breeze!

50
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,530
<i>I did tricks with that</i>
<i>flag the likes of which</i>

51
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,620
<i>no pony saw before,</i>
<i>and no pony's seen since!</i>

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,810
Professionalism, Ms. Dash,
I must insist.

53
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,770
If you want to keep your job
as coach of these ponies,

54
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,560
you must maintain a
professional attitude

55
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,590
and keep your
emotions in check!

56
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,980
Am I making myself absolutely,
100% crystal clear?

57
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,180
Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny.

58
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,910
You know, professionalism
is my middle name.

59
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,320
Rainbow
"Professionalism" Dash.

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,220
Hmph! Well, in
three days' time,

61
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,860
Ms. Dash will accompany anypony
competing to the Crystal Empire

62
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,180
where you will demonstrate
your routines for me

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,780
and the other judges.

64
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,370
Who will judge you
very professionally.

65
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,550
Ahem! Yes, quite,
quite correct!

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,960
In the meantime, get
ready to train and train hard!

67
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,470
Because I know this Opening
Ceremony is the single most

68
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,800
<i>important thing that will ever</i>
<i>happen in your young lives.</i>

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,550
But I know you're up
for the challenge!

70
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,950
And so am I!

71
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,480
WA-WAHOOOO-(cuts short)

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,750
AHEM!

73
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,020
Meet me after school tomorrow
at 1500 hours, sharp.

74
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,640
And show me
your flag-carrying skills.

75
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,080
I am outta here!

76
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,090
<i>(skid)</i>

77
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,860
Professionally!

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,460
See how professionally?

79
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,310
<i>(groan)</i>

80
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,940
Ponies, the most
important thing is this:

81
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,000
<i>your routine needs to show</i>
<i>what your town means to you.</i>

82
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,870
<i>So do Ponyville proud!</i>

83
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,520
Work hard. Be bold. Wow me.

84
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,400
That is all.

85
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,150
<i>(bell rings)</i>

86
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,860
<i>(excited shouts)</i>

87
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,120
So what do you say we come
up with the perfect routine

88
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,220
and win this thing?

89
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,440
I'd say that's rootin'
tootin' terrific!

90
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,010
<i>But there's one problem!</i>

91
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,640
I bet everypony in class
is planning to compete.

92
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,490
Listen, somepony in our class
is gonna carry that flag.

93
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,150
So it might as well be us!

94
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,680
Crusaders, are you in,
or are you in?

95
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,930
Cause I'M in.

96
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,100
Me too!

97
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:58,890
Me three!

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,280
All right, the winning
routine needs to show

99
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,250
what's important about
Ponyville, right?

100
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,040
Both: Right!

101
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,080
So what's special
about Ponyville?

102
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,480
It's...It's...

103
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,590
I've got it!

104
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,630
It's a place where
different kinds of ponies

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,210
live together as friends.

106
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,950
Earth Ponies, like me!

107
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,550
Unicorns, like me!

108
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,850
And Pegasi, like me!

109
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,690
So somehow we gotta figure out
a way to show that in our act.

110
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,410
We're gonna
need a plan.

111
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,080
And a lotta
hard work.

112
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,500
And a whole bunch
of practice.

113
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,590
But take it from me: We
may just be little ponies,

114
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,720
but we have hearts as
strong as horses!
