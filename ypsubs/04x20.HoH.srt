You two charlatans sold my
Granny a bottle of tonic

213

around like a yearling,

216
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:16,013
she's apt to drop from
exhaustion or worse.

217
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,506
What's more, I know for a
fact that your friend here

218
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,580
is dressing up as a
different pony every night

219
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:23,397
so he can pretend to be cured.

220
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,273
Well, that's quite
an accusation.

221
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:27,871
But let's say
that it's true.

222
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,408
Hypothetically.

223
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:30,388
Theoretically.

224
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,293
As I understand, your Granny
was a famous aqua-pony...

225
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:35,715
The star of the show,
once upon a time...

226
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:38,807
But hasn't set so much as
a hoof in the water since.

227

Until today.

228
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,209
That's right.

229
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:44,035
Well, then even if our tonic
were nothing more than a mixture

230
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,605
of apple juice
and beet leaves...

231
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:46,511
Hypothetically.

232
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:47,785
Theoretically.

233
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,977
The fact is that
Granny is happier now

234
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:54,243
than before she tried it.

235

237
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,486
Do you really want
to be the pony

238

who takes all that
happiness away?

00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:17,533
Honestly, Apple Bloom,
as long as it works,

244
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,204
I don't suppose
it really matters.

matter to you,

How in Equestria did you do it?

316
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:31,008
Hard work? Lots of practice?

317
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,046
Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic.

318
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:37,079
That's Flim Flam's Miracle
Curative Tonic, to be precise.

319
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,028
Buy it now, while
supplies last.

What are you
doing here?

323
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,895
Things are going so well, Flim
and Flam gave me a promotion.

324
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,840
Just made my first
bit as a salespony.

325
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,108
No more costumes
for this pony.

326
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:07,121
This is more of
a uniform.

327
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:09,533
If you say so.

328
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,733
I used to wonder if I was
doing the right thing, you know

329
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,087
pretending to be cured,

330
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:16,614
basically lying to
folks about this tonic,

331
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,926
but thanks to you, I realized

332
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:21,853
that sometimes honesty
isn't the best policy.

333
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:22,960
Thanks to...

334
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:23,791
me?

335
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:27,301
With Film Flam's
Magical Curative Tonic,

336
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,219
my Granny can do anything!

337
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,595
Just ask Applejack.

338
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:35,408
<i>(clicking cameras)</i>

339
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,627
No! This has gotta stop!

340
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:40,866
If ponies keep believing that
tonic can do things it can't,

341
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:42,581
who knows what will happen?

342
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,596
Maybe something
like that?

343
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:46,753
<i>(gasp)</i>

344
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,264
Granny!

345

What in blazes does
she think she's doing?

346
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:59,654
Granny's going to break the
Equestria high diving record.

347
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,167
Land sakes!

Now, what in tarnation
did you do that for?

352
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:34,567
That was the most
fool-pony thing

353
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,026
I've ever seen anypony
do in all my life.

354
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:40,917
You can't do a dive like that!

355
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,123
Aw, quit your fussin'.

356
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:46,706
I had enough tonic to do
a dive ten times as high.

357
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,600
Twenty times by
my count.

358
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,115
Thirty with a
favorable breeze.

359

<i>♪ (celestial) </i>

360
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,720
I hate to disappoint
everypony,

361
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:06,165
but there's no way Granny
could have made that dive

362
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:08,524
because this
tonic is a fake.

363
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:10,240
<i>(group gasp)</i>

364
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:12,427
But you gave it your
stamp of approval!

365
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,132
Are you saying you lied?

366
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,108
I am.

367

<i>(gasp)</i>

368
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:20,343
I didn't mean to.

369
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:22,850
But everypony seemed
so much happier,

370
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:24,351
<i>I couldn't bring</i>
<i>myself to tell you</i>

371
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,210
<i>when I found out the</i>
<i>tonic wasn't real.</i>

372
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:29,642
I know it was wrong.

373
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,432
I just hope, with time, I can
win back everypony's trust.

374
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:39,110
But if the tonic is a fake then
how come Granny can swim again

375
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:41,982
and what about all that
aqua-batic stuff we just did?

376
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,950
I reckon sometimes you can
forget what you're capable of

377
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,740
and it just takes a little
extra confidence to remember

378
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,594
that it was inside
of you all along.

379
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:53,399
But telling ponies your tonic
can do things it can't

380
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:54,725
is just wrong!

381
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:57,504
But you just said it
boosts confidence!

382
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:59,198
And that's not all it
does, folks--

383
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,632
<i>Yes it is!</i>

384
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:03,998
In fact, it's not
a tonic at all.

385
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:06,230
I know because I
helped make it.

386
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:10,764
Watching Applejack save Granny
and then admit to lying,

387
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:14,107
well, that made me realize
I was making ponies believe

388
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,202
in a thing that
just wasn't so.

389
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,315
Believing in something can
help you do amazing things,

390
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:21,508
but if that belief
is based on a lie,

391
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:24,505
<i>eventually it's going to</i>
<i>lead to real trouble.</i>

392
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,281
Thank you, Applejack.

393
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,029
I got this through
dishonest means.

394
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:33,281
<i>That was a mistake I</i>
<i>won't be making again.</i>

395
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,500
I'd like you to have it.

396
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,115
As a reminder of how you helped
me finally see the truth.

397
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:41,391
I don't know.

398
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:42,622
Oh, don't worry.

399
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:45,767
I'll track down the pony I
sold that worthless tonic to

400
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:47,900
and give them another bit
to replace this one.

401
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:49,086
Honest.

402
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:51,432
I'm sorry, Granny.

403
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:53,744
I hope this doesn't mean
you'll stop swimming.

404
00:20:53,914 --> 00:20:56,035
Why in tarnation
would I do that?

405
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:58,745
I just can't believe
those two salesponies

406
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,942
had me believing
I could near fly.
