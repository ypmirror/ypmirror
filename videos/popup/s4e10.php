<p> The Episode 10 from the Season 4 on iTunes has no usable audio at all, the AAC Stereo track is completely silent and the 5.1 Audio track has some silent channel, AND voice channel sound like it was recorded underwater.</p>
<p>7T/1T (Without subtitles) version contain fixed audio stereo, we unfortunately didnt has any source to rebuilt a 5.1 one, so we didnt put any 5.1 track on it. If we have a 5.1 track to use, 7R/1R will contain 5.1 too.</p>
<p>The fixed audio has been made by YayPonies, this is a resync from the Spazz TVrip audio !</p>
