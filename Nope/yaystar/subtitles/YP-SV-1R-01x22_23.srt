Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!         

22
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,119
               Seriously, Star, 
                there's nothing 
           to be excited about. 

23
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,854
        - It's just--           
  - The best day of my life!    

24
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,724
        We're going on          
        a field trip!           

25
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,793
 Cork it, princess.             

26
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,028
I can't believe                 
we're actually doing this.      

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,330
( gasps )                       
He's so cute!                   

28
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,733
I just wanna                    
gobble him up.                  

29
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,768
         I hope Jackie likes it 
                as much as you. 

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,738
 Ooh. Conversation starter.     

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,339
          Sh. She's right there.

32
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,109
Yeah, she's right there.        
You go talk to her.             

33
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,710
           More than just hello?

34
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,179
                  Too risky.    

35
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,747
                    I might say 
                something dumb. 

36
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,882
       This way, I let          
        the kitty pics          

37
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,185
        do the talking          
           for me.              

38
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:29,755
        Ooh. ( gasps )          
        Oh, I love it!          

39
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,691
      She sent me an LOL.       

40
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,193
          We're communicating.  

41
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,727
     - ( brakes squeal )        
        - We're here!           

42
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,598
( shivering )                   
Amazing!                        

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,700
What is it?                     

44
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,368
              It's a paper clip.

45
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,771
        Yuck. Luckily,          
       I got my phone.          

46
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,040
               No distractions, 
                      Mr. Diaz. 

47
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,775
                        And for 
               the rest of you, 

48
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:53,045
             no monkey business!

49
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,748
         This is the Echo Creek 
         Museum of Paper Clips. 

50
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,684
      We're gonna spend         
     the next eight hours       

51
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:01,353
  learning about the genius     
       of this little--         

52
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,756
       Miss Skullnick!          
      Stop. This hurts.         

53
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,059
           So boring!           

54
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,794
         ( clamoring )          

55
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,096
      BOY: Why must she         
         torture us?            

56
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,232
      Well, you know what?      

57
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,968
        Life is boring!         

58
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,638
       Miss Skullnick,          
 life is supposed to be fun.    

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,741
          I used to think that, 
                but now I'm 50, 

60
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,344
      and all my dreams         
 are in the rearview mirror.    

61
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,780
  The best thing in my life     
    is teaching you kids,       

62
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,816
        and I hate teaching you.

63
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,252
     That's 'cause you're       
     doing it all wrong.        

64
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:36,221
    You think you can lead      
  this trip better than me?     

65
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,057
     I was born to lead.        
          Literally.            

66
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,227
           ( raucous laughter ) 
           Okay, go ahead then. 

67
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,096
                  When you fail,

68
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,999
              those brats might 
            actually appreciate 
               me for a change. 

69
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,835
       Who wants to go          
    somewhere not boring?       

70
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,770
        - I do, I do.           
           - Yeah!              

71
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,305
Let's go to                     
the morgue.                     

72
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:04,149
   Welcome to the Dimension     
  of Wonders and Amazements!    

73
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,918
        ( all cheering )        

74
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,719
What is this place?             

75
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,154
      Just a planet full        
       of the most odd          

76
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,223
       and unbelievable         
   things in the universe.      

77
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,058
         No running,            
         no yelling,            

78
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,160
       no horseplay, no--       

79
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,695
      Hey, hey, hey, hey!       

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,703
    You put me in charge,       
     so rule number one:        

81
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,205
       no rules.                

82
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,240
        No rules leads          
         to anarchy.            

83
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,841
     When you give people       
         the freedom            

84
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,210
                 to do whatever 
                   they want... 

85
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,846
I get more bars here            
than I do on Earth.             

86
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,748
      ...they might just        
        surprise you.           

87
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,785
      Try to have a little fun, 
            you big old meanie. 

88
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,490
            Okay.               
     Walking With Trolls.       

89
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,726
                  I heard, once 
                     you go in, 

90
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,895
             you never come out.

91
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:53,198
           Wait, that's cows at 
    the hamburger factory. Huh. 

92
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,735
     Can we jump through        
    this light-ray thing?       

93
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,504
You don't have                  
to ask my permission.           

94
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:03,008
     Fly free, my curious       
       little sparrows.         

95
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,309
      Yeah!                     

96
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,978
         Being a leader is easy.

97
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,447
         Just say yes           
        all the time.           

98
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,215
       Take my hand, bro.       

99
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,351
          BOTH: Yeah!           

100
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,793
      <i> Trolls are one of</i>        
       <i> the universe's</i>          

101
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,396
       <i> few ultra super</i>         
        <i> centenarians,</i>          

102
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:27,399
          which means they live 
       a really, really, really 

103
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,968
               really long time.

104
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,939
        I'm gonna live          
          to be 400?            

105
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,808
   And here I thought I was     
going through the big change.   

106
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,344
          Turns out             
    I'm a teenager again!       

107
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,917
    ( imitates gun firing )     

108
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,985
     The cat is in the bag.     

109
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,887
          GIRL: Yeah!           

110
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,956
          ( laughing )          

111
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,229
   Uh, guys, I don't think      
   you're supposed to ride      

112
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,831
    a Dermathian stingray       
          like that.            

113
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,366
   Miss Star, may I jump into   

114
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,035
     this ominous-looking       
           vortex?              

115
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,871
       Francis, please          
      stop where you are        

116
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,339
       and ask yourself,        

117
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,509
      is this something         
    you really want to do.      

118
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,010
          Justin, no!           

119
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,814
      Um, yes, I really         
        wanna do this.          

120
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,484
       I really didn't          
     think this through!        

121
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,987
   Oh, stop. You guys knew      
      this would happen.        

122
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,990
That's not a good idea.         
Sabrina!                        

123
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,459
                     Hey, Star, 
              isn't this great? 

124
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,262
  Real great, but you might     
       wanna come down.         

125
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,864
            Justin!             

126
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,368
         Human expansion during 
   the industrialization period 

127
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,136
                   of the third 
             Nebulic Millennium 

128
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,839
                   gave rise to 
      the Fierce Troll warrior. 

129
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,974
   Trolls are abnormally strong,

130
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,877
         able to lift 100 times 
         their own body weight. 

131
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,013
         Oh, please.            
   There's no muscle here.      

132
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,083
     Did that just happen?      

133
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,954
   No LOL, no smiley face?      
           Nothing?             

134
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,289
            Jackie.             

135
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,958
         Time to drop           
     the A-bomb of cute.        

136
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,194
        A for adorable.         

137
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,263
                 ( laughing )   

138
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,100
         No, no, no,            
     don't jump on that.        

139
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,936
              I gotcha.         

140
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:15,407
   Why did you let me           
   do that, Star?               

141
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,043
           - Star!              
          - Sabrina!            

142
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,911
              Oh, ow, ow!       

143
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,548
     Don't worry. I... I...     

144
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,218
      I don't even know         
       how to help you.         

145
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,155
  "Universe's Most Deadliest    
          Creature"?            

146
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,925
Whoa, I told you                
these weren't gumballs.         

147
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,927
          ( purring )           

148
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,662
         What a tease.          

149
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,678
       Star, can I get          
        super powers?           

150
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,514
      Star, we're hungry.       

151
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,183
      I brought snacks.         
      Stinks to be you.         

152
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,152
     Star, can I touch it       
          with this?            

153
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,421
         ( shuddering )         

154
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,956
       Star. Star, meet         
         my new BFF.            

155
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,291
( guttural voice )              
BFF.                            

156
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,926
         ( stammering )         

157
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,095
           - Star!              
           - Star!              

158
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,664
           - Star!!             
    - ( all calling Star )      

159
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,033
      Can you guys just         
   be quiet for one second?     

160
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,504
       Ah, that's better.       

161
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,339
            Francis?            

162
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,042
            Justin?             

163
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,279
           Sabrina?             
    Where'd everybody go?       

164
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,614
Star. Star, guess what.         

165
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,684
Wait. Where's the rest          
of the class?                   

166
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,057
        Fine, Jackie.           
          I get it.             

167
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,492
         I know when            
       I'm not wanted.          

168
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,294
              ( phone clatters )

169
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,231
          No, no, no!           

170
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,632
         Please work.           
         Please work!           

171
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,102
 H-E-L-P?                       

172
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,572
         What's that            
       an acronym for?          

173
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,510
      Jackie's text said        
     they'd been captured       

174
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,111
        by some monster.        

175
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,646
   Marco and I can totally      
         handle this.           

176
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,548
      We fight monsters         
        all the time.           

177
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,451
                  I trusted you 
                 with the class 
              for five minutes, 

178
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,719
       and you lost them.       

179
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,554
            They're not lost.   

180
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,523
             We just don't know 
                where they are. 

181
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,092
They're wherever                
this is.                        

182
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,494
   Wait. I remember seeing      
       a trail of socks         

183
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,496
         right after            
    the class disappeared.      

184
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,998
               That's where I'm 
            starting my search. 

185
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,170
          This is it.           

186
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,072
        ( kids yelling )        

187
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,707
          Kids, don't worry.    

188
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,076
         You're gonna           
        be home soon.           

189
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,010
     ( ferocious growling )     

190
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,679
    Okay, we have to hurry.     

191
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,381
     Jump. I'll catch you.      

192
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,016
         Come on, jump.         

193
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,051
        I can't do this!        

194
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,520
   Take my hand, bro.           

195
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,388
        ( both yelling )        

196
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,724
          Hurry. Next.          

197
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,093
           - Marco!             
          - Jackie!             

198
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,494
         Hi. Hey, yeah.         

199
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,197
     Uh, hey, uh...             

200
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,032
             Marco?             

201
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,068
  I'll take care of Jackie.     
       You free Janna.          

202
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,540
        - Yeah, Marco,          
           help me.             
           - Gaaah!             

203
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,743
            Relax. They weren't 
                    real fangs. 

204
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,045
          Unless you            
       want them to be.         

205
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,248
            Quiet.              
         It's coming.           

206
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,484
         ( whistling )          

207
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,288
         ( screaming )          

208
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,561
         - All right,           
       string monster--         
            - No!               

209
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,462
     I'm back in charge,        
        and I need you          

210
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,298
      to get those kids         
          to safety.            

211
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,601
            - Wow!              
      - What did I say?         

212
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,469
    Go, go, go!                 

213
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,183
       What did I say?          
         Go, go, go!            

214
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,425
      Skullnick's really        
       got some moves.          

215
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,460
   You bet your tuchus I do.    

216
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,665
    Get ready to eat magic!     

217
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,204
      Get that bus moving.      

218
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,223
          ( cheering )          

219
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,858
That's how you do it.           

220
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,228
Hey, Marco, is someone          
sitting there?                  

221
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,596
               ( stammering )   

222
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,365
                      Huh, uh...

223
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,435
                  Yeah, you are.

224
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,642
        Star, hurry up.         

225
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,378
I'm coming.                     

226
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,814
( panting )                     
Hey, Cloudy,                    
can you put me down?            

227
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,616
       Sure thing, Star.        

228
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,253
        Thanks, guys.           
       You're the best.         

229
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,621
  We love you, Star.            

230
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,456
         Love you, too.         

231
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,325
         ( screaming )          

232
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,794
            Can you do anything 
                 without magic? 

233
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,763
     Sunshine Locker Slap!      

234
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,934
      - Love you, Star.         
         - ( neighs )           

235
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,436
              Hmm.              

236
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,538
"You use too much magic."       

237
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,807
    - Blah blah blah blah!      
    - ( blows raspberry )       

238
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,175
                  Hey, Marco.   

239
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,544
  Hey, Mike.                    
  Sweet beard.                  

240
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,647
       Thanks, Jackie.          
    I grew it last night.       

241
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,215
 JACKIE: So full.               

242
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,483
                  One night?    

243
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,686
     I've been working on       
       mine for weeks.          

244
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,688
  You know what the quickest    
   way to grow a beard is?      

245
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,589
                  Is it magic?  

246
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,458
          It's magic!!          

247
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,627
       I'll stick with          
    my peach fuzz, thanks.      

248
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,796
    This may not be much,       
        but it's mine.          

249
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,631
Marco, I've got                 
a magic wand.                   

250
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,332
I might as well use it.         

251
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,435
  Sometimes there's a sense     
       of satisfaction          

252
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,336
   in doing things yourself.    

253
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,205
Let me put                      
a beard on you!                 

254
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,374
 MARCO: No, don't touch it!     

255
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,379
          I did it.             
       I grew a beard!          

256
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,714
           USA, USA!            

257
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,849
         Congratulations, Marco.

258
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,251
       It looks really          
         good on you.           

259
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,954
Star, why are you               
making that face?               

260
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,390
          What face?            
      I don't make face.        

261
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,325
        You used magic          
      on me, didn't you?        

262
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,260
        ( shuddering )          
             No.                

263
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,729
 Oh, come on, Star.             

264
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,231
       Oh, you come on.         
       You look so good         

265
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,366
      in your little beard-y.   

266
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,736
     I wanted to grow it        
           myself!              

267
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,774
        Star, my face...        

268
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,416
         Wow. That is           
        a lot of hair.          

269
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,818
       Don't you worry          
your pretty little face, Marco. 

270
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,987
    It's nothing a little       
       magic can't fix.         

271
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,857
      Sparkle Razor Shave!      

272
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,292
     Oh, that's a taquito.      

273
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,261
      Hm. Where's my wand?      

274
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,662
        It's gotta be           
    around here somewhere.      

275
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,398
        Where is it?!           
         Wand? Wand!            

276
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,501
     I must've dropped it       
       in the bathroom          

277
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,436
  when Marco's face exploded.   

278
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,404
       Okay, think, Star.       

279
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,040
  What would a normal person    
      without a wand do?        

280
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,878
   Work, work, work, work,      
   work, work, work, work.      

281
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,313
       That's no help.          
    One second. I got it!       

282
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,719
         Normal person.         

283
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,423
                 I'm comin' for 
                    you, Marco. 

284
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,431
    Oh, man, this would be      
         a lot easier           

285
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,300
       if I had the wand.       

286
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,303
   But at least I got you,      
     Mr. Hedge Clippers.        

287
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,772
    ( as hedge clippers )       
     Yeah, you don't need       
      no stinkin' wand.         

288
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:30,341
       I wanna cut more!        

289
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,980
       I have location          
         on the wand.           

290
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,717
    It's inside the house,      
and it's ours for the taking.   

291
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:43,588
       That's a house?          
    It's covered in hair.       

292
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,456
       Maybe we should          
   come back another time.      

293
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,358
    Of course.                  

294
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,894
It's just, the wand             
has never been                  
unattended before.              

295
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,363
        ( all exclaim )         

296
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,432
             Fine.              

297
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,434
        But you idiots          
    are going to carry me.      

298
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,736
         I don't want           
  a single hair touching me.    

299
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,972
         Hold still,            
        you dumb bird.          

300
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,408
Hurry up.                       
Protect me.                     

301
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:10,415
      ( muffled yelling )       

302
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,392
    Man, not having a wand      
        isn't so bad.           

303
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,795
          I bet I'm             
      all the way to...         

304
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,065
         I'm still in           
      the living room?!         

305
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,535
      Mr. Hedge Clippers!       

306
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,471
                      Avenge me!

307
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,711
                Keep moving.    

308
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,779
             What's the hold-up?

309
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,882
         Master Ludo,           
    can't we take a break?      

310
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,450
        I'm dehydrated.         

311
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,485
      ( clucking )              

312
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,387
    No breaks.                  

313
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,688
This is taking forever.         

314
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,624
          Let's go.             
         Do your job.           

315
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,426
                       The wand 
                   is that way. 

316
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,495
             We're close.       

317
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:01,532
                 Clear the path 
       and move it, you idiots. 

318
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,402
                Here.           

319
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,940
           I'm stuck.           

320
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,408
           ( crying )           

321
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,578
     I wish I had my wand.      

322
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,746
( barking )                     

323
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:18,116
      Oh, there, there,         
         little guy.            

324
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,751
            You stuck here, too?

325
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,620
               Oh, I'm so tired,

326
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,123
         and his hair           
         is so soft.            

327
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,626
           Maybe we should take 
         a little nap together. 

328
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,430
Star? Star Butterfly?           

329
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,731
      Hello. Who's there?       

330
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,934
     It is I, Laser Puppy.      

331
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,105
    I thought you couldn't      
        get any cuter,          

332
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,874
        but look at you.        

333
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,443
          Thank you.            
    I wag my tail humbly.       

334
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,545
           You must not give up.

335
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,746
               Marco needs you. 

336
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:52,216
But it's just                   
so hard without my wand.        

337
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,719
     Let me remind you of       
   a time before your wand,     

338
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,221
  when a precocious pre-teen    
  got mixed up with snakes,     

339
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,223
      goblins and ghouls,       

340
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,892
      all while looking         
         super cute.            

341
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,127
         Oh, my gosh,           
       I was adorable.          

342
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,763
               You never needed 
              your wand before. 
        Why do you need it now? 

343
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,866
    Also, I'm a puppy that      
shoots lasers out of my eyes.   

344
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,102
           The choice is yours, 
                Star Butterfly. 

345
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,105
  Either rise up and conquer    
   or wither here and die.      

346
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,640
       ( voice echoing )        

347
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,842
           ( gasps )            

348
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,551
       - Ludo. What are         
       you doing here?          
       - It's the girl.         

349
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,658
                 Wait. The wand 
                   is that way. 

350
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,560
       Don't take her.          
        Get the wand.           

351
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,260
       ( speaking indistinctly )

352
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,696
    Uh, yeah, the bathroom      
         is occupied.           

353
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,041
      Master, the wand is yours.

354
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,276
         ( screaming )          

355
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,916
We've got someone               
who wants to wish you           

356
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,684
a very giggly                   
birthday, Ludo.                 

357
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,887
                     Here comes 
            the tickle monster. 

358
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,892
    Tickle, tickle, tickle.     

359
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,694
          ( laughing )          

360
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,898
          ( sobbing )           

361
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,698
          It tickles.           

362
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:22,767
       It's my birthday.        

363
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,204
              Hey, where is she?

364
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,610
 Normally, I'd blast you guys   
   with narwhals right now,     

365
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,346
   but hey, you don't need      
    magic for everything.       

366
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,385
            ( car alarm chirps )

367
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,720
             Oh, my gosh, Marco.

368
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,622
                  I was looking 
            everywhere for you. 

369
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,758
  ( muffled ) I'm so itchy.     
       Please help me.          

370
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,761
            You're right. I was 
        using my wand too much. 

371
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,664
       But I am Star Butterfly, 
           an independent woman 

372
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,633
        with fists like hammers.

373
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,336
( muffled ) I don't care.       
Just get rid of the hair!       

374
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,639
    And now, I shall shave      
    this beard off of you       

375
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,176
        with this tiny razor,   

376
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,777
      just like a normal person.

377
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,346
           Thank you, Marco,    

378
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,149
                for teaching me 
        such a valuable lesson. 

379
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,084
( Marco screaming )             

380
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,320
What a pathetic                 
display back there.             

381
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,389
     You guys make me sick!     

382
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,358
No more milkshake               
privileges for you.             

383
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,859
       ( all grumbling )        

384
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,728
I want you to                   
use that time                   

385
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,897
to think about                  
what you've done.               

386
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,798
Perhaps they should             
use that time                   

387
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,834
to think about                  
what you've done.               

388
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,702
                       Exactly. 
                    Wait, what? 

389
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,704
                 Let me ask you 
                    a question. 

390
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,307
     What kind of leader        
throws you into a pit of hair,  

391
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,342
   makes you do all the work,   

392
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,945
and shows you no appreciation   
     for your sacrifices?       

393
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,980
   Are you talking about me?    

394
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,183
     What kind of leader        
      has all the power         

395
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,386
       in the universe          
      at his fingertips,        

396
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,154
       and gets tickled         
       right out of it?         

397
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,123
      Toffee, what are          
          you doing?            

398
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,825
        Your soldiers           
       deserve better.          

399
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,794
         ( sputtering )         

400
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,763
         You are fired!         

401
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,398
         Let's put it           
      to your soldiers.         

402
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,766
 Who's the better leader,       

403
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,901
            Ludo...             

404
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,469
             or me?             

405
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,071
    ( all talking at once )     

406
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,207
     You guys belong to me.     

407
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,741
Three-eyed                      
potato baby,                    

408
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,743
I am like                       
a father to you.                

409
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,213
Beard deer, I took you          
in off the streets.             

410
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:19,283
Are you stupid imbeciles        
really going to listen to him?  

411
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,488
       You can't do this.       

412
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,725
      This is my castle.        
    Those are my monsters.      

413
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,860
          Not anymore.          

414
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,796
            Toffee.
