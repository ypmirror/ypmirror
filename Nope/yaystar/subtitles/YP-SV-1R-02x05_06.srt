23
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,600
         If you love            
     bike riding so much,       

24
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,536
     you should learn to

00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,204
                You can do that?

          Teach me,

Nope. I got you

00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,015
          You won't let go?

00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,420
Yes, I promise, Star.           

34
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,222
               Okay. Vroom!     

35
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,857
 Okay, hold on.                 

36
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,359
First, this bike                
is not a toy.                   
It's my baby.                   

37
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,761
           My honey.

     - ( kissing sounds )       
           - Okay.              

42
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,205
   But where are the giant      
       invisible goats?         

43
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,739
 Invisible goats?               

44
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,241
           Come on,             
          you know.             

45
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,943
          To pull you!          

46
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,779
     Everything on Mewni        
is pulled by invisible goats.   

47
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,748
What? Uh, there are             
no giant invisible goats.       

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,750
 On Earth, we use pedals.       

49
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,320
           Oh, cute!            

50
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,722
          On Mewni,             
  only flowers have petals.     

51
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,792
Okay, the first step            
of biking is to coast.          

52
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,160
         Okay, you've           
        got the seat.           

53
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,795
       I've got the seat.       

54
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,798
           Huh? Wow!            

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,834
        Hey, I got this.        

56
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,437
  Yes! Okay, Marco, you can     
   let go of the seat now.      

57
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,640
      I think I'm ready         
     to do it on my own.        

58
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,243
       - Oh, I already          
     let go of the seat.        
           - What?              

59
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,311
   Yep, you've been riding      
       all by yourself.         

60
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,182
    Marco! You said you'd       
     hold onto the seat.        

61
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,518
        You lied to me!         

62
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,686
    Ah, come on. I did it       
   to give you confidence.      

63
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,655
        And look at you.        

64
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,690
    You're awesome, and I       
taught you everything you know. 

65
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,494
    - Except how to stop.       
   - What?! Use the brakes.     

66
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,663
          You never taught me...

67
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,832
                          how!!!

68
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,568
          ( panting )           

69
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,871
           Call Star.           

70
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,641
         ( shrieking )          

71
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:56,975
           Hi, Marco.           

72
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,777
                You have to use 
                    the brakes. 

73
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,879
             Just put your feet 
                  on the pedals 

74
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,881
       - and push back.         
     - That doesn't even        
         make sense.            

75
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,883
        It's spinning           
        the other way.          

76
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,952
      This princess says        
        no, thank you.          

77
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,555
Fine. Do you have               
your wand?                      

78
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,857
           Oh, dip.             
     It's in my backpack.       

79
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,494
       ( keytar playing )       

80
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,329
 Uh... Oskar?                   

81
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,697
      What are you doing        
       in my driveway?          

82
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,866
      I thought this was        
          my studio.            

83
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,869
       JK. Everywhere's         
          my studio.            

84
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,705
    Whatever. Just drive.       
          That way.             

85
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,241
                       Seatbelt.

86
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,810
Uh, why is your car             
filled with garbage?            

87
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,946
      Yeah, it's sort of        
      a live/work space.        

88
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,851
     Oh, hey, it's Gene.        
Oh, double hey, it's my keys.   

89
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,054
              Go!               

90
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,797
         Don't walk.            
     It says don't walk!        

91
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,868
             Sorry.             

92
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,770
        ( horn honking )        

93
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,406
  Oskar, Oskar, Oskar, Oskar!   

94
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,814
  - Cool. Little book dude.     
         - Glossaryk.           

95
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,752
     Pop quiz, Mr. Diaz.        
        Where is Star,          

96
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,387
        and why do you          
        have her wand?          

97
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,789
     I was teaching Star        
     how to ride a bike.        

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,791
       She doesn't know         
         how to stop.           

99
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,594
           - Help.              
            - Hmm.              

100
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,529
     Where are the giant        
       invisible goats?         

101
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,565
There are no giant              
invisible goats.                

102
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,767
Star doesn't have her wand.     
You have to help her.           

103
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,801
                Mmmm.           

104
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,704
          ( chanting )          

105
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,143
 What?! Are you joking?         

106
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,445
       Boy, this isn't          
       a magic problem,         

107
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,047
         and thusly...          

108
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,950
     is beyond my control.      

109
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,886
             Whoa, you put corn 
            chips on your subs? 
                  That is dope. 

110
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,223
      I love the crunch!        
       You must try it.         

111
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,761
                Whoa!           
                Cheers.         

112
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,095
  Cheers.                       

113
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,897
   Uh...                        

114
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,867

145
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,152

    Besides, I'm moving forward.

158
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,965
             Pedaling backwards 
        doesn't make any sense. 

159
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,202
  I know just how she feels,    
 'cause I can't stop either.

          the wand.             

164
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,521
      - Use your magic.         
           - What?              

165
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,661
             Oskar!             

166
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,397
    Star, wait. Your wand.      
          ( gasps )             

167
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,036

168
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,978
          - Marco!!             
           - Star!              

169
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,913

      - ( horn honking )        

170
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,252
I should've never               
let go of her seat.             

171
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,920
                  Okay, no more 
                kidding around. 

172
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,422
           This calls for magic.

173
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,691
          ( chanting )          

174
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,026
      ( stomach rumbling )      

175
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,630
      Uh... which is what I'd do

176
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:22,367
  if I hadn't eaten that...     
  ooh... that meatball sub.     

177
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,468
             ( groaning )       

178
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,204
            Word.               
          ( groans )            

179
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,306
               Okay, it's up to 
                    you, Marco. 

180
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,942
           Give her wand to her 
             and save her life. 

181
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,444
How? The car's wrecked.         

182
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,312
      Ride the invisible        
      goats, of course.         

183
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,015
       Now if you'll excuse me, 
             I'm gonna be sick. 

184
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,117
                    ( vomiting )

185
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,152
      ( angry stammering )      

186
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,823
 For the last time, there are   
  no giant invisible goats.     

187
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,058
        Sure there are.         

188
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,728
   You just need to believe.    

189
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,830
  If you want to save Star,     
       trust in goats.          

190
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,365
          ( vomiting )          

191
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:57,469
   Fine. If it saves Star,      
        I'll believe.           

192
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:06,077
        ALL: Believe,           
      believe, believe.         

193
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,346
            Believe!            

194
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,048
                Believe!        

195
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,753
       ( goat bleating )        

196
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,922
   I'm on an invisible goat!    

197
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,090
          ( laughing )          

198
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:23,028
    Okay, goat, tally whoa!!    

199
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,563
             Whoa!              

200
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:30,101
 Star, take the wand.           

201
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,103
          Marco, you're my hero.

202
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,105
   Who I'm still upset with     
       for lying to me          

203
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,740
         about holding my seat. 

204
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,109
  Come on, give me one more     
        chance. Hurry!          

205
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,845
       ( Marco yelling )        

206
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,250
       Help! Help, help!        

207
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,591
      ( Star screaming,         
       goat bleating )          

208
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,126
  You're gonna have to stop     
    the bike by yourself.       

209
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,696
Pedal in reverse!               

210
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,565
   I told you, that is not      
  how we do things on Mewni.    

211
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,968
You're not on Mewni             
anymore, Star.                  

212
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,103
And if I can believe in         
an invisible goat,              

213
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,772
then you can stop               
that bike.                      

214
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,108
          I got you.            
          Trust me.             

215
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,378
         Thanks, Marco.         

216
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,181
        But you believing in me 
                 is all I need. 

217
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,458
           - Star!              
      - ( goat bleats )         

218
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,760
       I was so worried         
          about you.            

219
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,729
          Marco, you were right.

220
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,397
              I can ride a bike.

221
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,766
                       And I am 
                 awesome at it. 

222
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,668
          How about             
    Mysterious Sonograms?       

223
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,837
        That's a good           
          band name.            

224
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,939
But does it match               
our sound?                      

225
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,274
    Hey, Oskar, I'm really      
    sorry about your car.       

226
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,311
         But if you want, I can 
           give you a ride home 
                    on my bike. 

227
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,447
    Cool. Hey, Glossaryk,       
        Gene, hop on.           

228
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,449
  Safety first.                 

229
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,284
   Marco, you coming?           

230
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,488
       No thanks, Star.         
     I'll take the goat.        

231
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,190
            Believe.            

232
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,331
         ( laughter )           
     Oh, Marco, the goat        
        left long ago.          

233
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,367
              ( groaning )      

234
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,670
 ( horns honking )              

235
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,341
   Okay, Diaz, you got this.    

236
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,810
Aim it at                       
the little...                   

237
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,211
      ( angry muttering )       

238
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,514
    All right, going again.     

239
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,851
Hey, this is                    
hard enough already.            

240
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,154
Star, can you please            
get control of these puppies?   

241
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,622
 I'm trying to focus.           

242
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,458
      Yeah, no problem.         
      Totally. Come on.         

243
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,362
         I believe in           
         you, Marco.            

244
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,197
 Star, I'm concentrating.       

245
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,498
                  Right, right, 
           right, right, right. 

246
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,367
            Okay, I'll be quiet.

247
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,336
                 Even if no one 
                   else does... 
                     I believe. 

248
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,205
Got it. I'm                     
trying to focus.                

249
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,973
            ( mirror chiming )  

250
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,342
Just answer it, please.         

251
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,845
         Ugh. Hey, Mom.         

252
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,381
  <i> Star, your Aunt Felicity</i>     
    <i> still hasn't received</i>      

253
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,550
   <i> her thank-you card for</i>      
   <i> the lovely necklace...</i>      

254
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,251
    Just give me the juice!     

255
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,920
   I can't right now, Mom.      
    Things are happening.       

256
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,188
        <i> You said that</i>          
      <i> the last time...</i>         

257
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,323
        Marco, did you          
       free the nectar          

258
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,225
          from the juice cocoon?

259
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,060
Get the puppies                 
out of the way.                 

260
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,596
     Oh, stop it, puppies.      

261
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,399
        Here. Go fetch!         

262
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:18,036
             Oh no!             

263
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,237
                   Did you just 
               throw your wand? 

264
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,572
        I threw my wand.        

265
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,574
The poo-poo bin!                
No, no, no!                     

266
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,042
 Oh, thank Mewni.               

267
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,211
 Saved by the bush.             

268
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,612
    What?                       

269
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,948
        ( straining )           
           Got it.              

270
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,353
          Oh, you're            
        just a doggie.          

271
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,422
For a second, I thought         
you were a gargoyle.            

272
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,391
       - Thank you for          
     bringing me my wand.       
         - ( growls )           

273
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,427
              Ooh!              

274
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,797
       - I can just...          
        - ( growling )          

275
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,466
     - Let me just get...       
        - ( growling )          

276
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,469
                     All right, 
              this is annoying. 

277
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,239
        Is your person          
       here somewhere?          

278
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,808
There's no one else             
in the park, Star.              

279
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,210
Everyone always leaves          
when we get here...             

280
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,312
 for some reason.               

281
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,482
The laser puppies               
are hungry.                     

282
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,352
    - Just grab your wand.      
          Let's go.             
            - Hmm.              

283
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,222
                 Star, what are 
                     you doing? 

284
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,291
                  That's a dog, 
                    not a coat. 

285
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,993
         - Fur coat.            
            - No.               

286
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,395
         Look, you're basically 
               a pet owner now. 

287
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,297
              You're gonna have 
                   to feed him. 

288
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,533
        He'll put the wand down 
            if he wants to eat. 

289
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,343
           - Okay.              
      - Is that normal?         

290
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,646
      ( toilet flushing )       

291
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,581
       ( water running )        

292
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,355
        Sorry. This is          
        your problem.           

293
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,691
           I'm gonna go to bed. 
              Come on, puppies. 

294
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,660
               ( barking )      

295
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,765
  Hi.                           

296
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,633
So it's                         
bedtime now,                    

297
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,536
and I sleep best                
with my wand                    

298
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,505
 right under my pillow.         

299
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,974
Even though my mom              
says not to,                    

300
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,211
because of...                   
radiation.                      

301
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,780
                 ( growling )   

302
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,849
          ( snoring )           

303
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,455
 Star, you down here?           

304
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,157
           - What?              
        - ( screams )           

305
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,793
        Star, come on.          
     We gotta get going.        

306
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:22,827
        We're gonna be          
       late for school.         

307
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,996
          Okay, okay.           

308
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,731
    - Just give me a sec.       
        - ( growling )          

309
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:30,635
Magic doggie,                   
get me ready for school.        

310
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,807
          All right.            
    Guess it's a hat day.       

311
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,542
         ( bell rings )         

312
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,544
        They make this for kids.

313
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,179
                      Just open!

314
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,214
      - Miss Butterfly.         
           - What?!             

315
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,649
     Where are you going        
        with that dog?          

316
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,751
       He's got my wand.        

317
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:50,388
     A dog in a classroom       
 is a roadblock to learning.    

318
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,358
         Do not come back until 
       you get rid of that dog! 

319
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,026
 ( groaning )                   

320
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,628
         - Cool hat,            
       Star Butterfly.          
          - Shut up.            

321
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,565
   <i> Star, you have to send</i>      
 <i> your aunt a thank-you card.</i>   

322
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,333
     <i> It's a really nice</i>        
          <i> necklace.</i>            

323
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,569
 I can't talk right now, Mom.   
I just got kicked out of school.

324
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,605
         -  <i> What...</i>            
 - Uh, no dogs in the store.    

325
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,908
             Sure. Ignore me.   

326
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,677
        I'm not, like,          
   a person with feelings.      

327
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,579
                    Or anything.

328
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,881
        That'll be a buck-fifty.

329
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,083
       Oh, I can't make         
     any money right now,       

330
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,452
        'cause my dog           
         has my wand.           

331
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,221
        - ( growling )          
            - See?              

332
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,523
                         Right. 
              On your tab then? 

333
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,625
          Oh, yeah.             
      Yeah, yeah, yeah.         

334
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,459
        It's Marco Diaz.        

335
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,228
       Cool. Thanks, Joe.       

336
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,562
                 Name's not Joe.

337
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,797
        And my name's           
          not Marco.

           Come back.           

341
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,576
               Please stop that.

342
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,112
            Sorry.

      You're a smallish         
     medium-to-large dog.

       Yep, dog-ish face.

    You may or may not bark!    

350
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,563
  I'm pretty sure this flyer    
is talking about you, mister.   

351
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,566
        "Call 555-0199."        

352
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,168
        Okay, 555-0199.

00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,573
               Hello. Thank you 
                  for calling-- 

356
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,343
     Hi. I got your flyer       
and I think I found your dog.   

357
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,579
        I do not have           
          any pets.             

358
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,115
             Is someone calling 
                  about my dog? 

359
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,584
         - Uh, yeah.            
        - It's for me.          

360
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,520
                         Hello. 
                 This is Lydia. 

361
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,322
     Hi. I found your dog.      

362
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,291
         I am outside           
     the Stop And Slurp.        

363
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,093
                 Be right there.

364
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,928
       Okay. Bye.               

365
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,497
Hi. Here for                    
this little gargoyle?           

366
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,698
I found him.                    
Here you go.                    

367
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,502
                 Come to Mommy, 
               my little, um... 

368
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,139
         Willow... bee.         

369
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,275
Right. Okay. Can you get        
Willoughby to drop my wand?     

370
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,478
             I... I can do that.

371
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,614
         Willoughby,            
         put it down.           

372
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,117
      Where are you going?      

373
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,157
      ( toilet flushing )       

374
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,625
       ( water running )        

375
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,627
It's cool you taught            
your dog to use the bathroom.   

376
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,362
            Yeah.               
      ( nervous giggle )        

377
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,233
That's not your dog,            
is it?                          

378
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,535
              ( nervous giggle )

379
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,174
        But I have...           
    so much love to give.       

380
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,476
 MARCO: Stand up.               

381
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,412
           - Bark.              
         - ( barks )            

382
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,714
 Now play pirate.               

383
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,049
      Now laser the hole.       

384
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,117
    ( shrieks )                 

385
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,723
      - Okay, everything        
         is half red.           
       - ( door opens )         

386
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,058
         Star, where            
        have you been?          

387
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,759
       - I don't wanna          
        talk about it.          
           - Okay.              

388
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,761
            Today was the worst 
               day ever, Marco. 

389
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,663
 I got sent home from school,   
  I couldn't make any money,    

390
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,398
      - so I had to put         
   everything on your tab.      
           - What?              

391
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,734
        I was harassed          
       by a weird lady,         

392
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,104
              and worst of all, 
         Willoughby still won't 
          give me back my wand. 

393
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,739
            ( frustrated groan )

394
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,441
 His name's Willoughby?         

395
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,443
          That's what the weird 
               lady called him. 

396
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,678
      I thought I found         
      his owner, but she        
       was just a fake.         

397
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,781
Yeah, this flyer's              
obviously fake,                 

398
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,349
but let's go back               
to the dog park                 

399
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,251
and see if his real owner       
put up a flyer.                 

400
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,353
          ( sighs )             
            Okay.               

401
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,356
     - You know your eye        
      is glowing, right?        
          - I know.             

402
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,761
             Nope.              

403
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,263
       Beep, beep, beep.        

404
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,731
             Where's your owner?

405
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,434
                 My problem is, 
                   I'm stuck in 
                  a doubt loop. 

406
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,603
    You so are.                 

407
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,272
             ( beeping rapidly )

408
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,640
                     ( buzzing )

409
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,709
                      Mm-mm.    

410
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,646
      Come on, Willoughby.      

411
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,915
    - Why is this so hard?      
       - I know. Right?         

412
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,251
                Oh, right.      

413
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,786
        Your thing is hard, too.

414
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,821
          ( groaning )          

415
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,623
  Willoughby senses something.  

416
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,991
         ( Star gasps )         

417
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:52,663
         Marco, look.           
    Beautiful businessman.      

418
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:56,400
       Go, Willoughby.          
   Go to your businessman.      

419
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,817
          That's it!            
         What the...            

420
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,860
 Sorry.                         

421
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,329
      What just happened?       

422
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,765
 Who are you?                   

423
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,367
             It doesn't matter. 

424
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,302
Why did you                     
take my wand?                   

425
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,804
                      ( sighs ) 
       Because in my dimension, 

426
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,840
              dogs are the ones 
         with all the problems. 

427
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,775
       There's no escape.       

428
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,278
 Only sadness.                  

429
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,047
It's easier if you              
poke it from the bottom.        

430
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,916
          You did it.           

431
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,685
          White grape.          

432
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,188
      All I really want         
         is to be...            

433
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,889
       like them.               

434
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,692
        I thought if I          
zapped myself with your wand,   

435
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,794
        I could quiet           
      my troubled mind.         

436
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,362
          ( slurping )          

437
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,700
But you can't just              
run away from                   
all your problems.              

438
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,803
( choking ) You run away from   
 your problems all the time.    

439
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,072
    No. I just take breaks.     

440
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,708
     That's what I want.        
       I want a break.          

441
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,743
You don't need                  
magic for that.                 

442
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,712
You need                        
a chew toy.                     

443
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,913
         ( squeaking )          

444
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,082
And you need                    
to play fetch.                  

445
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,917
          No, Star!             
          No fetch.             

446
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,752
Oh, yeah.                       

447
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,254
And you need                    
a Marco, too.                   

448
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,725
         Hey, Lydia,            
      I found your dog.         

449
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,760
       Again.                   

450
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,262
                 I've been here 
                     all along. 

451
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,931
          Come here,            
     my sweet little boy.       

452
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:34,999
     Actually, he's a girl.     

453
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,734
       It doesn't matter.       

454
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,537
             My little cake pop.

455
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,772
         It's time to come home.

456
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,274
    Go on.                      

457
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,943
       I guess it couldn't hurt.

458
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,579
Wait.                           
There's one more thing.         

459
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,719
                 Your necklace? 

460
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:55,753
                  I couldn't.   

461
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,355
      Eh, it's a win-win.       

462
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,257
    This way, I don't have      
   to send my Aunt Felicity     

463
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,758
       a thank-you card.        

464
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,959
        ( baby talk )           
    Now go get your Lydia.      

465
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,362
       Uh, why are you          
   talking to me like that?     

466
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:08,132
'Cause that's how               
we talk to wittle doggies.      

467
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:18,376
    This is what happiness      
         feels like.            

468
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,846
          ( panting )           

469
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,952
                  Thank you for 
                finding my dog. 
                           Bye. 

470
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,990

I do face my problems.

                 calling again? 

473
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,229
         Break!
