        It's me, Star.          

20
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,385
  I have some exciting news     
           for you.             

21
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,354
      Well, first, Marco        
        got kidnapped,          

22
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,656
      and then I blew up        
      a bunch of stuff,         

23
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,491
       including my wand.       

24
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,226
    And I was super bummed      
      because I thought         

25
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,728
    I was never gonna get       
      to do magic again,        

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,731
       but then, I got          
         my new wa...           

27
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,768
          My new wand!          

28
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,603
          Oh, yeah,             
      and Marco's okay.         

29
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,439
         Say hi, Marco.         

30
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:14,573
              Hey!              

31
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,245
I don't want the computer       
to watch me shower.             

32
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,847
                       ( gasps )

33
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,584
       - What's up with         
          your wand?            
       - I don't know.          

34
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,719
             Oh, no, it's going 
                    downstairs. 

35
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,588
           ( yells )            

36
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,256
         I almost died.         

37
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,963
                       My towel!

38
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,731
           Hang on.             
      I'll get you out.         

39
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,966
              Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
                 Wait a second. 

40
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,235
      - I'm not decent.         
         - Oh, okay.            

41
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,603
                Don't open that.

42
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,205
Wasn't gonna.                   

43
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,210
        Uh, it's locked.        

44
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,811
             What?!             

45
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,815
                   Try the knob.

46
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,750
      What do you think         
         I am doing?            

47
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,786
       No, no, not now,         
           sweetie.             

48
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,788
        I usually open          
   this door with my wand.      

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,058
    Well, your book ate it.     

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,060
        Better not be           
   pokin' around in there.      

51
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,962
  That's my secrets closet.     
        It's private.           

52
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,396
    Just get me outta here.     

53
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,731
         ( straining )          

54
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,271
What are you doing?             

55
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,006
      Uh, hey, Glossaryck.      

56
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,641
       My wand's locked         
        in the closet.          

57
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,476
      Hey, what about me?       

58
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,612
      Oh, yeah. Marco's         
        in there, too.          

59
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,313
       And my spell book.       

60
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,682
   Basically all my stuff.      
       I want my stuff.         

61
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,850
     Did you try the knob?      

62
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,919
I tried                         
the knob.                       

63
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,324
Anything?                       

64
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,028
      Nope. Still locked.       

65
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,030
           Aha! What's going on?

66
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,366
              Is this some kind 
              of training thing 
                  or something? 

67
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,835
Are you some kind               
of training thing?              
Are you mad?                    

68
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,870
Is this wolf-kabob rock bandage 
ba-ba-bandage --                

69
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,505
            Stop, stop. Stop it!

70
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,007
               Just tell me how 
            to get out of here. 

71
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,675
Okay, I'll tell you             
what to do.                     

72
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,311
     - Are you listening?       
    - Yes, I'm listening.       

73
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,814
     To reach the chunks        
      in the hobo stew,         

74
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,050
       find her secret.         
       That's the clue.         

75
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,687
       So if I find her secret, 
          the door's just gonna 
                magically open? 

76
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,722
Good-bye!                       

77
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,725
            Secret?             

78
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,296
 Which one?                     

79
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,965
          Here we go.           

80
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,871
      Why don't you try         
         the easy way           

81
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,472
      and open the door         
         with magic?            

82
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,241
      I can't do magic.         
   My wand's in the closet.     

83
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,809
           ( gasps )            

84
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,878
       Do you wanna try         
        the hard way?           

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,913
             Yeah!              

86
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,082
      What's the hard way?      

87
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,318
      You've never heard        
       of the hard way?         

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,752
Nope. Sounds hard though.       

89
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,388
          Oh, it is.            
     But I can teach you.       

90
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,757
           Teach me.            

91
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,661
      The lesson begins         
      inside my eyeball.        

92
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,833
     Imagine the universe       
  as this big old cauldron,     

93
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:58,237
         and magic is           
   the bubbly stew inside,      

94
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,073
 and your wand is the spoon.    
          And now...            

95
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,342
    My wand isn't a spoon.      
         It's a wand.           

96
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,544
     It's a metaphor, Star.     

97
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,179
                No, it's a wand.

98
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,781
       Fine. It's a wand.       

99
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,116
          Now you're getting it.

100
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,185
Now the wand can only           
skim the surface                

101
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:16,021
of the hobo gravy,              
watery and brown.               

102
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:19,191
       But if you want          
    to get to the chunks,       

103
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,793
you've got to dip down.         

104
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,197
Get it?                         

105
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,200
                          Uh-uh.

106
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,602
          Okay, look.           

107
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,137
       You can do magic         
      without your wand.        

108
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,972
       You just have to         
      dip down, ya know?        

109
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,541
          Dip down.             
          <i> Dip down!</i>            

110
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,976
        Without my wand?        

111
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,745
        Your mom did it.        

112
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,913
         Psh! If she can do it, 
                   I can do it. 

113
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,983
    Okay, I've just gotta       
          dip down.             

114
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,122
                      Hot laser!

115
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,791
         I am so sorry.         

116
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,561
   Star, try dipping down...    

117
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,497
        for the chunks.         

118
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,999
         ( whistling )          

119
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,801
                             Ow!

120
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,704
      Ah, Marco my boy.         
  How's it going over there?    

121
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,908
  Oh, you know, just trying     
    to find her "secrets"       

122
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,643
  in a closet full of secrets!  

123
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,080
Yes, well, you know             
I do this because I love you.   

124
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,315
         Okay, that's           
       a little weird.          

125
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,750
        I'm sure it is.         

126
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,918
     Now if you don't mind,     

127
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,820
      I've got work to do.      

128
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,089
         Yeah. So do I.         

129
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,925
          Help... me!           

130
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,861
        - ( screams )           
            - Hmm.              

131
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,867
          ( whistles )          

132
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,782
      You ever dip down         
        before, Sajak?          

133
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,952
       Yeah, me neither.        

134
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,221
          What a mess.          

135
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,357
  It's time to get organized.   

136
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,031
              No.               

137
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,801
              No!               

138
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,504
     Dip down, dip down,        
     dip down, dip down.        

139
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,707
   Dip down, dip down, dip      
  down, dip down, dip down.     

140
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,976
           Dip <i> down!</i>           

141
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,079
             <i> Down!!</i>            

142
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,052
        Aquarium blast!         

143
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,223
         Fish blast.            
        Are you okay?           

144
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,731
           Dip down.            

145
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,004
           Dip down.            

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,247
             Nope.              

147
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,085
     ( Marco screaming )        
      They're biting me!        

148
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,586
       That didn't work.        

149
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,088
                    Stop eating 
                      my flesh. 

150
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,626
             Hmmm.              

151
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,862
       Hmm. Hmm. Hmmmmm.        

152
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,635
          ( exhales )           

153
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,937
        Ahem. Call Mom.         

154
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,207
             Star?              

155
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,942
           Hi, Mommy.           

156
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,744
        What did you do?        

157
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:28,947
         ( stammering )         

158
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,950
     Okay, Marco's locked       
        in my closet,           

159
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,085
  and Glossaryck wants me to    
   dip down to get him out.     

160
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,954
           Dip down?            

161
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,390
     I didn't learn that        
       until I was 19.          

162
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:44,496
      Wow! So I'm, like,        
          advanced.             

163
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,964
         ( chuckling )          

164
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,066
           I suppose.           

165
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:52,404
Anyway, Glossaryck didn't really
give me any instructions, so... 

166
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,173
   Ha. That sounds familiar.    

167
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,775
      Well, it's not easy.      

168
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,343
    If you want to dip down,    

169
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,979
      you have to summon        
     everything you have.       

170
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,315
          Everything?!          

171
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,017
              Oh!               

172
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,086
          Everything.           

173
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,857
Star, you do know               
what I mean by everything...    

174
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,525
         Yeah, totally, totally.

175
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,530
        Okay, I think           
      that's everything.        

176
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,473
      You want everything?      

177
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,676
   Everything you shall get.    

178
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,279
          Marco Diaz            
       makin' progress.         

179
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,281
 ( crashing )                   

180
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,462
     Okay, that's not good.     

181
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,832
   Well, Marco, looks like      
     I'm just a skimmer.        

182
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,868
     Skimmin' the surface       
      of the hobo gravy.        

183
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,470
     The watery hobo gravy.     

184
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,872
        How are things          
        goin' for you?          

185
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,641
                    Not so good.

186
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:07,312
    Actually, you thwarted      
         my progress.           

187
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,381
           I guess              
      it's not that bad.        

188
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,716
    I can slide sandwiches      
       under the door.          

189
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,051
    Bring you your homework.    

190
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,686
  Life could be good for you.   

191
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,222
      I don't wanna live        
   in your secrets closet.      

192
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,494
( yells )                       

193
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,529
 All right.                     

194
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,164
       No more riddles,         
         little man.            

195
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,333
       Tell me what I'm         
 supposed to be looking for.    

196
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,801
            My eyes!            

197
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,108
        Oh! So this is          
          the thing.            

198
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,177
                  Bingo.        

199
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,712
        Star, I found the thing.

200
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,514
             It's a little book.

201
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,882
          That's good.          

202
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,017
      Reading will keep         
       the mind sharp.          

203
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,252
          Like a horn.          

204
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,354
                        It's in 
               Mewnian writing. 

205
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,022
                      Oh, wait, 
                here's English. 

206
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,191
                  "Chapter one. 
            Mom's a poop head." 

207
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,193
       Mom's a poop head?       

208
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,962
          Marco, no.            
     No, no, no, no, no!        

209
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,463
        Hang on, Star.          
     Just give me a sec.        

210
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,131
          Marco, no.            
    That's not the thing.       

211
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,633
   - That's not the thing!      
     - Skipping forward.        

212
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,102
   - Marco, put that down!      
   - "On my tenth birthday,

   all the servants' beds."     

214
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,872
              Hey.              

215
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,441
               I'm out of juice.

216
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,176
                Dip down!       

217
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,713
  Marco, it's not the thing,    
     it's not the thing!

220
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,652
           ( gasps )            

221
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,221
           Dip down.            

222
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,971
           I did it!            

223
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,640
     I dipped, I dipped,        
       I dipped, Marco!         

224
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,942
I'm not a skimmer.

226
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,712
Sorry. But don't                
read my journal.                

227
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,184
      Well, this thing's        
           broken,              

228
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,653
      but give it a whirl.      

229
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,359
       Uh...                    

230
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,662
I'm gonna go                    
put on some pants.              

231
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,330
             Uh...

           ( coughs )           

233
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,367
        I call dibs on          
        the new tower.          

234
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,614
             Where is my castle?

235
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,215
           It's gone.           

236
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,651
                   And where is 
                     your wand? 

237
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,153
           That's gone, too.    

238
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,221
          Everything?           

239
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,290
   We are no longer friends!    

240
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,391
          We never were friends.

241
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,728
         You are now            
       my mortal enemy.         

242
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,431
       This day, I vow...       

243
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,169
( screaming )                   

244

    ( screaming continues )     

245
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,217
     Adrift in the universe     

246
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,353
 that is infinitely expanding.  

247
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,490
       Toward nothing...        

248
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,393
       away from nothing.       

249
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,664
      A passage of time         
        marked by age.          

250
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,201
       Marked by hunger         
        of the spirit.          

251
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,870
         And hunger...          

252
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,406
          of the body.          

253
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,042
             Alone.             

254
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,678
         Infinitely...          

255
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,880
            Chips...            

256
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,381
            Food...             

257
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,251
         ( straining )          

258
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,420
                      Come back.

259
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,800
          Where am I?           

260
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,068
              Ow!               

261
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,705
     Dirt...Ow! In my eye!      

262
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:59,144
     The sky is throwing        
      water at my face.         

263
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,283
           My chips!            

264
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,352
        Can I please...         

265
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,508
        Sushi come back.        

266
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,044
        I want my sushi.        

267
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,486
                   Oh, yes, yes.

268
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,188
             Excuse me, brother.

269
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,332
                Lunch over?     

270
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,408
      You never loved me!       

271
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,361
         ( stammering )         

272
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,231

    Please don't let me go.     

275
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,811
                   ( straining )

276
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,213
 Don't fight it, bro.           

277
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,581
You're stuck.                   

278
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,817
Just let it happen.             

279
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,989
             Snow!              

280
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,291
          ( crying )            
            Snow.               

281
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,332
                     No, no.    

282

          ( laughter )          

284
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,204
            You taste bad.      

285
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,339
         Never mind.            
        I'll shut up.           

286
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,282
      Oh, that's horrible.      

287
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,350
      Tastes pretty good.       

288
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,589
More, please.                   
Please, please, please.         

289
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,039
        How long have           
        I been asleep?          

290
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,183
      Where are you going?      

291
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,162
              Ow!               

292
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,618
            Gotcha!             

293
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,993
           My chips!

    ( high-pitched shriek )     

296
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,435
          Big mistake.          

297
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,585
                Come and get me.

         ( shrieking )          

299
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,682
         Ya-ha. Uh-oh.          

300
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,905
  Look out below.               

301
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,677
  I win, and to the victor...   

302

          the spoils!           

303
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,014
           Go get it.           

304
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,676
Keep it comin'.                 

305
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,844
   Good.                        

306
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,614
            Whoa.               
        That's enough.          

307
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,351
          You'll get            
      the scraps later.
