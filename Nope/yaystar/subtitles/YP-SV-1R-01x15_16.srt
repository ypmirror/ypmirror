26
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,918
          Hey, Star.            
   I'm here to take you...

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,787

         I've got a life coach,

44
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,757

46
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:08,994
                Don't you wanna 
                  pet my bunny? 

47
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,765
Well, he is adorable.           

48
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,800
           Hi-yah!              
             Oh!                

49
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,103
       Back off, demon!         
            Marco!              

50
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,339
          ( growling )          

51
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,940
            Oh, no.             

52
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,942
         Walk it out            
       and talk it out.         

53
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,944
         Walk it out            
       and talk it out.         

54
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,045
              Walk it out...    

55
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,647
Uh, you better run.             

56
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,749
            Oh, no, no, no, no. 
                         Ha ha. 

57
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,284
         No, no. Oh...          

58
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,987
     Oh, that's why I got       
      my support system.        

59
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,956
                      I'm good. 
           Got the angries out! 

60
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,727
          Everything is-- hoo-- 
                 under control. 

61
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,729
 Marco, don't karate him.       

62
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,165
This is... Tom.                 

63
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,833
         Demon ex-boyfriend Tom?

64
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,836
         Nice to, uh, meet you, 
                         Marco. 

65
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,771
     What is he doing here?     

66
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,741
He wants to take me             
to the Blood Moon Ball.         

67
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:57,342
        Star, never go          
       with a predator          

68
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,744
     to a second location.      

69
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,512
     Look, I can see you're mad.

70
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,914
     You think I'm a total jerk.

71
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,916
                      I get it. 
            But I have changed. 

72
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:07,719
              Remember, I'm not 
       the only one with horns. 

73
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,689
Why didn't you tell me          
I'm dead?                       

74
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,758
( making karate-like groans )   

75
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,694
     No pressure. If you decide 
                you want to go, 

76
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,262
            just toll this bell.

77

78
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,434
     Oops, almost forgot        
      the little hammer.        

79
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,102
         I hope I see you there.

80
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,175
        You're making           
     a big mistake, Star.       

81
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,178
Maybe, but it could             
be fun.                         

82
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,780
             Why don't you just 
                     stay here, 

83
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,349
     where it's always fun?     

84
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,984
       Like, guaranteed.        

85
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:42,354
Well, this is                   
a different kind of fun.        

86
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,889
         Don't look.            
      I'm gonna change.         

87
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,124
    I just don't trust Tom.     

88
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,292
  Maybe I should go with you.   

89
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,294
      Marco, you weren't        
           invited.             

90
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,097
 Besides, you gotta trust me    
to do the right thing for my--  

91
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,933
          Self-aaah...          

92
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,168
             Are you okay?      

93
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,870
        Yeah, totally,          
      totally, totally.         

94
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,939
      I just gotta stop         
       using magic on--         

95
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,908
        on-- on my face.        

96
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,143
                 All I'm saying 
               is guys like Tom 

97
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,845
         never change.          

98
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:10,882
Well, there's only one way      
for me to find out.             

99
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,951
       What do you think?       

100
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,090
       You look amazing.        

101
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,825
 Thanks, Marco.                 

102
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:20,926
     ( strained whisper )       
          Don't go.             

103
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,463
        ( whispering )          
      I'm totally going.        

104
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,298
    ( deep, resonant gong )     

105
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,106
                     Mmm.       

106
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,474
        Smells like burnt toast.

107
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,277
     Let's get this show        
         on the road!           

108
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,979
      Which floor, mortal?      

109
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,915
Uh, I guess the bottom.         

110
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,083
         Let me just            
     ride down with you.        

111
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,551
                Good-bye, Marco.

112
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:50,122
        See you after           
    the <i> Blood Moon Ball.</i>       

113
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,524
           <i> Oooooh...</i>

117
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,533
Whoa, whoa, whoa.               
Okay, guys.                     

118
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,235
I don't know what               
you're about to do,             

119
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,937
but I want to keep things       
low-key for Star.               

120
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:05,937
               You want to turn 
            the Blood Moon Ball 

121
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,874
           into a greeting card 
             holiday, go ahead. 

122
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,842
    Wait, which one of you      
          said that?            

123
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,144
              Me.               

124
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,945
No, okay, whoever               
was just talking,               

125
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,247
 raise your hand.               

126
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:19,851
Master Tom, Princess Butterfly  
has arrived.                    

127
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,120
       Wow.                     

128
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,959
       Star Butterfly.          
   Don't you clean up nice!     

129
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,896
       Uh, thank you...         
           I guess.             

130
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,230
       I got you this.          
         What is it?            

131
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,833
             It's a hair thing. 
          It goes in your hair. 

132
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,168
                 It'll help you 
              fit in down here. 

133
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,104
How sweet, Tom.                 
but, yeah.                      

134
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,540
         I kinda got            
  my on thing going on here.    

135
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,975
  I'm pretty happy with it.     
    Let's go have fun now.      

136
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,577
        ( angry groan )         

137
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:49,915
You can be positive             
that your anger is negative.    

138
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,586
   ( music playing on radio )   

139
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,026
       I'll have my own         
       Blood Moon Ball          

140
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,964
      in Star's bedroom,        
    where it's always fun.      

141
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,039
         MAN'S VOICE:           
     Blood moon tonight.        

142
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,015
            VOICE:              
     The moon of lovers.        

143
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,628
          ( eerily )            
            Smile.              

144
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,233
          ( both groaning )     

145
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,502
           Beautiful.           

146
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,572
I'm so excited to be            
covered in blood with you.      

147
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,142
But don't worry, it's not real. 
It's from a unicorn.            

148
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,309
        My best friend          
        is a unicorn.           

149
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,078
 Well, they're not related.     

150
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,247
            I'm not gonna bathe 
         in unicorn blood, Tom. 

151
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,948
( stifled angry groan )         

152
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,583
         What's that hand doing 
                    back there? 

153
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,319
           Nothing.             
     Whoa, wait a second.       

154
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,989
    Are you getting angry?      
             No.                

155
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:07,459
Look, you do you, Boo,          
I'm gonna go get a drink.       

156
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,095
            STAR:               
     Here he comes again.       

157
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,129
         Hello, Henry.          

158
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,564
           His name is Henry.   

159
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,433
         You must be            
         Tom's date.            

160
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,500
      I guess I am.             

161
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,701
   Well, I hope you're happy.   

162
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,470
      He made this whole        
         entire ball            

163
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,539
      completely boring,        
         all for you.           

164
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,040
        I wouldn't say          
         it's boring.           

165
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:22,040
          Oh, really?           

166
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,644
   Aloof attractive people.     
           Boring!              

167
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,246
   Bubbling cauldrons that      
don't even melt your flesh off. 

168
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,581
         What is it,            
    nap time or something?      

169
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,316
       'Cause I'm bored.        

170
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,085
          Piece of garbage that 
  doesn't destroy the universe. 

171
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,087
               Stupid cockroach 
             that lives inside. 

172
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,556
      I'm over it already.      

173
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:41,059
     ( screaming, sobbing )     

174
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,360
                You wanna dance?

175
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,062
     Her dance card's full.     

176
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,264
        Oh, I get it.           
 I bet you think that, like,    

177
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,100
    your soul, and, like,       
           her soul             

178
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,970
     are totally gonna...       
           mmmmmm!              

179
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,040
What is "mmmmmm"?               

180
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,108
     ( speaker feedback,        
       clears throat )          

181
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,312
        Good evening,           
     ladiesngennlebremen.       

182
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,215
      It is my pleasure         
    that I request you now      

183
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,117
   <i> to turn your heads skyward</i>  

184
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,087
    when the light of the       
  blood moon drupples down,     

185
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,289
         and selects            
       two lucky souls,         

186
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,159
    binding them together       
         for eternity           

187
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:18,230
       in its hypnotic,         
         ruby brodum.           

188
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,764
             Whoa.              

189
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,701
 ( eerie organ music playing )  

190
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,703
           Oh! That's the wrong 
                piece of music! 

191
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,505
                  This is gonna 
                drive me crazy. 

192
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,340
  All right, don't go anywhere. 
            I'll be right back. 

193
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,175
 Okay.                          

194
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,177
  Ooh.                          

195
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,146
       ( hushed tone )          
            Star.               

196
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,051
        ( whispering )          
         Star. Star!            

197
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,522
          ( all gasp)           

198
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,095
              Oh!               

199
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:53,198
       ( music playing )        

200
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,436
                       ( gasps )

201
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,138
        ( angry groan )         

202
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,706
            Star...             

203
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,075
       How did you know my name?

204
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,144
        It's me, Marco.         

205
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,445
          ( gasps )             
            Marco?              

206
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,580
 What are you doing here?       

207
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,748
           Let's get outta here.

208
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,082
        This place is the worst.

209
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,217
        ( angry growl )         

210
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:27,065
           That dance was meant 
                       <i> for me!</i> 

211
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,238
        Walk it out...          
          No, Brian!            

212
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,211
        ( demonic roar )        

213
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,256
 Let's go, Marco.               

214
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,261
      ( flames whooshing )      

215
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,165
         ( bell dings)          

216
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,100
            Thanks for the lift.

217
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,337
            Ugh! So infuriating.

218
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,173
      I hate to say it,         
 but I warned you about Tom.    

219
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,776
                       No, you! 
            You're infuriating. 

220
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,478
        Me? I was just          
       trying to help.          

221
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,147
             You don't trust me 
        to do things by myself. 

222
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,251
           I'm 14.              
    I can handle a demon.       

223
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,154
I know you're trying            
to look out for me,             

224
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,291
but you have to let me          
figure things out on my own.    

225
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,661
I don't nee a hero.             
I need a friend.                

226
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,768
                      ( sighs ) 
                  You're right. 

227
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,703
        I should have           
         trusted you.           

228
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,439
                      I'm sorry 
           I ruined your night. 

229
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:45,543
Well, it wasn't                 
a total disaster.               

230
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,313
Now I know                      
you can dance.                  

231
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,581
        ( both chuckle )        

232
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,316
       Hat hair. Whoa!          
       Hat hair. Whoa!          

233
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,517
        We both said--          
        We both said--          

234
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,785
       The same thing.          
       The same thing.          

235
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:54,919
       Okay, stop that.         
       Okay, stop that.         

236
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,321
         ( both gasp )          

237
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,257
               ( stifled laugh )

238
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,926
       ( both laughing )        

239
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,395
Well, that was new.             

240
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:04,696
                    Yeah, weird.

241
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,464
Now go make me                  
some nachos!                    

242
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,933
            MARCO:              
            Okay.               

243
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,571
        ( pained cries )        

244
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,507
             How are you losing?

245
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,343
     You guys have, like,       
      200 pounds on her!        

246
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,878
  ( crying )                    

247
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,314
At least hit her                
with a rock or something!       

248
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,883
                    ( growling )

249
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,251
      ( frustrated groan )      

250
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,719
           Whoo-hoo!            

251
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,587
       Off the cactus,          
        over the tree.          

252
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,256
        Nothing but net!        

253
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,858
              Unh!              

254
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,294
    Told you I could do it.     

255
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,263
                ( all growling )

256
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,297
 Double or nothing.             

257
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,233
One kick,                       
seven monsters.                 

258
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,768
    Hyah!                       

259
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,570
             Noooo!             

260
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,539
       After a victory          
          like this,            

261
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,507
         there's only           
       one thing to do.         

262
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,309
       Get Chinese food!        

263
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,278
 Ooh, Chinese food!             

264
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,347
I have no idea                  
what that is.                   

265
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,250
          ( groaning )          

266
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,319
        ( angry cries )         

267
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,621
         ( screaming )          

268
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,491
           You guys are useless!

269
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,960
          ( groaning )          

270
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,595
   ( squeaking indistinctly )   

271
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,465
  You're always screwing up     
     my brilliant plans.        

272
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,434
I need someone who can wrangle  
        you imbeciles.          

273
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,636
              Oh, go get change!

274
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,306
      ( bubbling )              

275
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,674
     Delicious.                 

276
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,910
And it's so fun eating          
with these tiny wands.          

277
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,280
( "pew pew" shooting noises )   

278
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,849
Oh, and there's cookies, too.   

279
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,986
I don't like the filling.       

280
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,255
      These are fortune cookies.

281
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,325
           They can             
magically predict the future.   

282
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,861
What? No way.                   

283
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,929
   "A friend will greet you     
        with a smile."          

284
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,931
 Aww, how sweet.                

285
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:47,932
                  ( gasping )   

286
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,835
      See, the cookies know all.

287
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,838
        No, it can't be.        

288
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,641
"Think positive and good luck   
     will come your way."       

289
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,477
     ( excited shouting )       
        More cookies!           

290
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,513
        They're stale.          
            Gimme!              

291
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,882
            You're a weird girl.

292
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,951
Wow, Star. Good luck            
did come your way.              

293
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,286
        It did, it did.         

294
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,554
     These are incredible.      

295
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,956
        Star?                   

296
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,294
         APPLICANT:             
 Eh, previous job experience?   

297
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,797
       Nope. No one's ever been 
        dumb enough to hire me. 

298
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,865
 Weaknesses? I don't have any.  

299
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:21,866
           ( blergh )           

300
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,301
    How am I under pressure?    

301
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,335
            Awesome!

00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,503

       Hmm, is that so?         

303
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,739
       Ah, yeah, um, why?       

304
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,474
    Did you hear otherwise?     

305
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,910
   I can't take it anymore!     
        ( screaming )

        in ten years?           

307
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,948
   Oh, we're best friends,      
 and we hang out all the time   

308
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,317
       sharing feelings         
      and holding hands.        

309
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,686
 ( incomprehensible garbling )  

310
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,721
 You make absolutely no sense.  

311
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,756
                Go away.        

312
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,926
         Soft. So soft.

 These idiots are even dumber   
       than you idiots.

00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,539
        West Mewnin swamp water.

319
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,441
       Or, do you drink         
       from the bottle?         

320
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,710
   On days like this...         

321
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,445
       Tell me about it.        

322
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,547
Oh, I'll tell you... ( garbled )

323
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,451
  I've been trying to steal     
   a wand from a teenager.      

324
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,119
It's harder than it ought to be.

325
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,055
             Wait a second.     

326
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,959
 Where did you come from?       

327
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,894
       I let myself in.         
            When?               

328
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,530
     After you hired me.        
         I hired you?           

329
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,698
                       I accept.

330
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,999
           Excellent.

  Did anybody catch his name?   

335
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,545
            Toffee?             

336
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,381
  I guess his name is Toffee.

       ( birds chirping )

 Oh, wise and powerful cookies, 

339
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,489
bestow your sugary prophecies   
           upon me.             

340
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,490
      Ehh...                    

341
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,458
    Gotcha, Star.               

342
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,159
 Those fortunes aren't magic.   

343
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,462
      They're put there         
   by people in a factory.      

344
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,397
            Next you'll tell me 
            that's how they get 

345
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,199
        the snow in snow globes.

346
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,568
 It's clear they're the work    
       of dark wizards.         

347
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,703
 I'm serious. They're not real. 

348
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,139
They're just vague so you can   
    read things into them.      

349
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,110
    "An unexpected visitor      
      will soon arrive."        

350
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,548
             See?               

351
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,750
      No one's here.            

352
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,718
    Now, who wants nachos?      

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,520
Did someone say nachos?         

354
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,190
         Well, hello,           
    my unexpected visitor.      

355
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,927
    Ferguson, Star thinks       
 fortune cookies are magical.   

356
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,561
     Will you please tell       
       her they're not?         

357
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,063
     Now, whoa, man. Whoa.      

358
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,498
      Cookies are magical.      

359
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,700
       Once, I ate one          
   from the floor of a cab,     

360
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,735
  and I met my spirit animal    
         that night.            

361
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,504
         It was a wolf.         

362
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,475
     Why are you suddenly       
       a non-believer?          

363
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,178
     "Reach for the stars       
   and achieve your dream."     

364
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,513
          ( groaning )          

365
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,480
         ( screaming )          

366
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,549
      ( alarmed yelling )       

367
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,717
          Huh?                  

368
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,185
Pegasus feathers.               

369
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:57,655
    I have always dreamed       
of having a skylight in here.   

370
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,157
                ( groaning )    

371
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,225
      Blindly following         
    these fortune cookies       

372
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,594
     is the best decision       
       I've ever made.          

373
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,163
    Can you give me a hand?     

374
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,500
              Yes.              

375
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:13,638
        Okay, Toffee,           
    I'm going to show you       
what we're working with here.

384
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,888
 Be honest. I can handle it.    
        Ludo, Master.           

385
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,159
The girl thinks the messages    
in her cookies are fortunes.

00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,694
She does whatever they say.

         Interrupting!          

388
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,566
        Well, Toffee.           
   Give it to me straight.      

389
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,735
Are my monsters the worst ever, 
           or what?             

390
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,103
                     Uh...      

391
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,538
     ( groaning, cracking )     

392
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,875
      Oh, man. It's stuck.      

393
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:56,514
  Maybe we can do something     
 with those fortune cookies.    

394
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,549
  What? What is... what, what?  

395
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,551
   You sure you trust him, boss?

396
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,120
               Of course.       

397
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,125
 Oh, last cookie.               

398
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,660
I can't wait to get more.       

399
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,995
          Star, I'm telling you,

400
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,964
             they'll back me up 
             at the restaurant. 

401
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,066
  Food can't predict the future.

402
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,701
 Sure it can.                   

403
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,936
On Mewni, there's a place       
where you can get calzones      

404
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,571
       that'll tell you         
   how you're going to die.     

405
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,909
  You will die from choking     
        on a calzone.           

406
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,545
        Just kidding.

It's not the will of the cookie.

 I can totally grab it.

00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:04,775
     What?                      

444
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:09,147
          You idiots            
  are screwing up the plan.     

445
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,649

00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,322
      Okay, look, Star.         
 This is really hard to say,    

449
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,957
 but, if this is going to go    
        any further,            

450
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,059
   I want our relationship      
to have a foundation of honesty.

          So confused.          

453
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,764
 Fortune cookies aren't real.   

454
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,766
  It was all a trap so Ludo     
    could steal your wand.

00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,671
           We hope...           

458
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,907
           We hope              
  this isn't a deal breaker.    

459
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,246
  You know what this means,     
       don't you, Star?         

460
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,781
                     Oh, yeah.  

461
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,683
   Love is never the answer.    

462
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,753
  Oh, man. I wanted to say it.  

463

       listened to you.         

468
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,945
  Obviously you know better     
       than a dessert.          

469
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,346
              No, it's my fault.

470
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,148
         I shouldn't            
     have messed with you       

471
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,317
   and said those fortunes      
were magical in the first place.

472
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,318
                ( door opening )

473
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,953
           Oh, weird perky girl.

474
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,721
      You want some more        
        stale cookies?          

475
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,723
Who could say no to that?       

476
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,062
         ( chuckles )           
What? They're not real fortunes,

477
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,431
but they're still real cookies. 

478
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,735
        "A great evil           
     has been unleashed."       

479
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,437
            BOTH:               
           Ooooohh.             

480
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,407
                         Cheers.

481
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,111
     That was the closest       
       we've ever come,         

482
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,281
        but that girl           
 always gets the best of me.    

483
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,850
          Yes, well,            
 you're not the first monster   

484
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,885
 to fall victim to their magic. 

485
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,121
            LUDO:               
   Things will be different     
     when I get the wand.       

486
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,524
   ( laughs, makes "pew pew"    
      shooting sounds )
