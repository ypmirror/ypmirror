120
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,241
        And that's when         
           I realized           

121
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,109
   nothing makes you happier

00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,068
         So you brought         
      these monsters here       

126
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,636

            - Yeah.             

127
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:27,606
      I just didn't expect      
            so many.            

128
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,608
        But don't worry.        

129
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,476
           This armor           
      will hold them off.

Give it up,                     
Star Butterfly.                 
You're outmatched.

     all the same monsters      

136
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,558

       Mm, I don't know.

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,161
           I've never seen      
           this dude in my life.

139
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,531
     You mean you've never

Surely you know                 
Spike Balls.

            Hi. I'm Spike Balls.

                    I'm usually 
                    in the back.

145
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,044
        Now that you all        
        know each other,        

146
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,046
         get the wand!

          I like that again.    

150
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,499
     You were right, Marco.     

151
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:30,268
    I am totally cheered up.    

152
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,404
       I don't even care        
        if Oskar calls.

       terrible ringtone?       

155
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,643
         It's supposed          
         to be ironic.

00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,237
         Oskar, can you         
 hold on for, like, one second?

        You did know            
        just how to cheer me up.

180
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,386
            Oskar called anyway.

       your side of the counter.

188
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:35,293
   Is it that hard to just be   
      a little organized?       

189
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,494
              I'm organized.

        with this thing?

        under the hood.

   Have you seen my charger?    

198
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,952
          I know it's           
     around here somewhere.     

199
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,721
         Where did you          
          last see it?          

200
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,422
     Where is that stupid thing?

          This is why           
    you gotta get organized.

222
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,713
        Gnome repellent?        
  Extra-strength ghost heads?   

223
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,815
    How do you find anything    
         in this place?         

224
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,316
      It only looks messy.      

225
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,485
        Legend says that        
   the founders of Quest Buy    

226
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,388
     had an ancient cryptic     
  system of symbols they used   

227
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,323
     to organize the store.     

228
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,893
       Some have gone mad       
     trying to decipher it.     

229
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,461
       I finally got it!        

230
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,429
    Housewares is that way.     

231
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,732
      [laughing excitedly]      

232
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,033
              [whimpering]      

233
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,402
If there's                      
a system here,                  

234
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,405
I'm gonna use it                
to find the best route          
to the charger department.      

235
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:31,709
         Lucky for you, I myself
         know my way around here
         pretty well myself,    

236
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,812
          if I do say so myself.

237
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:37,348
             I think I just said
             too many "myselfs."

238
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,883
           Hey, boss,           
       look what I found.       

239
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,451
    We're not getting that.     

240
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,087
   Aw, but you'd look           
     so cute in it.             

241
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,558
  Stop trying to sneak          
 things into the cart.          

242
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,627
       Same goes for you.       
I don't even know what that is. 

243
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,830
     Look, we're only here      
         because I need         

244
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,631
     an electric beak groomer.  

245
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,467
      Keeps the tip sharp       
  while brightening my smile.   

246
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,804
              Oh, clerk peasant.

247
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,674
            Bring me your finest
            beak groomer.       

248
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,109
       Sorry, that's not        
         my department.         

249
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,912
        I want the name         
  of your supervising wizard.   

250
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,582
             Halt!              

251
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:13,484
         Those who wish         
        to pass my lair,        

252
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,787
       answer my riddles        
          if you dare.          

253
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,488
      - I do not breathe--      
            - A leg.            

254
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,690
          - But I run.          
            - A leg.            

255
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,959
          - And jump.           
            - A leg!            

256
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,995
   And... wait. How could you   
      possibly know that?       

257
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,130
        - The internet.         
          - Internet?           

258
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,700
          You should look it up.
          Now come on, come on. 

259
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,035
           - Open up.           
       - [sighs wearily]        

260
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,670
                      Thank you.

261
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,673
        You ever hear of        
  the internet, skeleton door?  

262
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,376
           [silence]            

263
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,779
       Okay, it should be       
      right through here.       

264
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,550
        Gnome repellent?        
  Extra-strength ghost heads?   

265
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,151
We're right back                
where we started.               

266
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,987
How is this                     
even possible?                  

267
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,556
             Let's see.         
             Made a right turn, 
             another right turn.

268
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,025
      Another right turn,       
    then another right turn.    

269
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,627
      This makes no sense!      

270
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,695
               Well, well, well.

271
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,898
      Looks like Quest Buy      
        really does have        

272
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,699
      everything a monster      
          could want.           

273
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,535
        - Ludo!                 
        - Now hand over         
        that wand,              

274
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,572
     or there's going to be     
   a big clean-up on aisle...   

275
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,774
    uh, what aisle is this?     

276
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,843
       That's not my department.

277
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,881
    Rainbow Avalanche!          

278
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,685
Uh, just give me                
a sec here.                     

279
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,020
     Uh...                      

280
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,855
   Narwhal Nightmare!           

281
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,493
               Get me that wand!

282
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,630
     Big Boy Diaper Blast!      

283
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,471
      Oh, no.                   

284
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,774
       This doesn't look        
        familiar at all.        

285
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,776
         You know what?         
         We tried this your way.

286
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,612
    Now we're gonna try this    
       the organized way.       

287
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,881
             Hmmm.              
       I think I got it.        

288
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,450
   That elevator will take us   
right to the charger department.

289
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,718
                 Come on.       

290
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,856
                   Hold the door
                   there, folks.

291
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,993
    Oh, close, close, close!    

292
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,996
         Thanks, guys.          

293
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,473
          There it is.          

294
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,176
   Don't worry, little wand.    
      We're almost there.       

295
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,644
Told ya I'd get us there.       

296
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,513
                     We stopped.

297
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,553
           Sorry, folks,        
           this elevator's      
           no longer in service.

298
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,855
           Welcome to           
   the booby trap department.   

299
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,490
    Please step carefully...    

300
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,492
           - [gasps]            
      - Don't help me up.       

301
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,227
    - I get workers' comp       
    for this.                   
    - [elevator bell dings]     

302
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,166
      See ya later, guys.       

303
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,002
             Guys?              

304
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,573
          - Get 'em!            
          - [screams]           

305
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,509
          Ow. Ow. Ow.           
            Ow. Ow.             

306
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,877
                  Look out.     

307
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,545
            Blades of doom.     

308
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,183
        Massacre darts.         

309
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,826
   A hallway with walls that    
  smash together periodically.  

310
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,999
    We made it.                 

311
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,269
       There's so many chargers.

312
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,271
          We'll never find      
          the right one in time.

313
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,140
Oh, yes, we will.               

314
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,610
Because this time,              
we're gonna get organized.      

315
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,845
I'll figure this out.           
You go hold off the monsters.   

316
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,615
                          Right.

317
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:31,816
         There she is.          

318
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:43,661
    You're not gonna tell       
    my boss about this, are you?

319
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,346
       Well, well, well.        

320
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,682
      It looks like Mama's      
 havin' pork chops for supper.  

321
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:07,985
       [clucking angrily]

        - [ angry cluck]        

324
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,303
         Beak 'N' Trim.         

325
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,904
          I found it.           

326
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,742
       Ludo, I found it.        

327
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,953
     Marco, where are you?      

328
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,688
            I found the charger!

329
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,723
      It took me a while,       
     but once I figured out     

330
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,625
        they were using         
      the metric system...      

331
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,760
      Just give me              
      the cock-a-doodie charger!

332
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,197
         Yes! I got it!         

333
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,334
       Yes. I've got it!        
            Finally.            

334
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,936
           Evil is in

00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,085
               What's wrong with

     Are you gonna pay for      
      that charger, ma'am?

 My arch-nemesis will cover it. 
       He kinda owes me.        

346
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,909
     - You do realize that      
     we could just walk?

347
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:41,012
       I had it right in        
           my claws.

You see, Star,                  
it pays to be organized.

            Yeah, that's rude
