00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,254
    Wha.. Wha..                 

121
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,388
                  What?!        

122
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,324
              I had no idea     
  these were your parents!      

123
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:26,992
        I just assumed          
       everyone on Earth        

124
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,360
    had the last name Diaz!     

125
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,228
            Won't it be nice    
         to have Star's upbeat, 

126
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,198
                 lively energy  
               around the house?

127
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,467
We could have gotten that       
from a litter of puppies.       

128
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,171
            I love puppies!!!   

129
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,373
          ( yipping )           

130
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,175
                    BOTH: Aww...

131
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,382
           Oh. Eh...            

132
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,453
Well, they are really cute.     
       Ha ha ha ha!             

133
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,355
     Ay! My eye!                
    Ha ha ha ha!                

134
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:59,024
          Marco, why don't you  
         show Star her new room?

135
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,292
         Yay!                   

136
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,430
         ( evil laughter )      

137
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,308
         ( croaks )             

138
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,642
         Ludo, Master.          

139
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,412
I've tracked down               
 Star Butterfly.                

140
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,347
  They've hidden her            
in the Earth dimension,         

141
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,015
 unguarded.                     

142
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,884
            ( evil laughter )   

143
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,423
        Excellent work,         
          Buff Frog.            

144
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,492
   I knew they couldn't hide    
        that royal brat         

145
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,093
       from me for long.        

146
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,396
   So the wand will be mine.    

147
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,131
     And then the universe.     

148
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,899
          And then...           

149
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,501
    Actually, the universe      
         should do it.          

150
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:47,906
      I'm coming for you,       
      Princess Butterfly.       

151
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,541
Here's your new room.           

152
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,543
         Ow!                    

153
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,145
                          O-kay.

154
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,147
                      I can     
                 work with this.

155
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,151
                  Sparkle       
           Glitter Bomb Expand! 

156
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,393
                 Whoa.          

157
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,395
 Ah, that's better.             

158
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,431
 I wish I had a room like this. 

159
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,499
      You do?                   

160
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,634
                   Huh?         

161
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,971
  Mystic Room Suck Transform!   

162
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,308
         ( screaming )          

163
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,079
          Suck? Suck?!          

164
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,382
         Why was the word "suck"
             in that spell?     

165
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,451
       I don't know.            
It just came out that way.      

166
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,985
                ( groans )      

167
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,655
I'm sorry, Marco. Uh...         

168
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,558
How about a little sunshine     
   to brighten your day?        

169
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,329
      ( thunder rumbles )       
            Ohh...              

170
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,097
                      I can't   
          take this anymore!    

171
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,500
    If you're moving in,        
        I am moving out!        

172
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,635
 Uhh!                           

173
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,205
         Are you okay?          

174
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,173
     Luckily the cactuses       
        broke my fall.          

175
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,108
        Do you need any help?   

176
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,243
      Ow!                       

177
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,244
  I'm fine!                     

178
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,480
 Just leave me alone!           

179
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,249
               Uh. Ohh.         

180
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,384
              Ahh. Hmm.         

181
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,986
               Ahh. Uhh.        

182
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,122
               Huhh.            

183
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,325
        Here he comes,          
        here he comes.          

184
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,094
Hey, brother, do me a solid.    
     Refill this for me!        

185
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,698
They won't let me back inside   
     because I'm soggy!         

186
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,099
Did you bring me my refill?     

187
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,534
         Don't make eye contact.

188
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,338
   If you come to my house,     
    you bring toilet paper!     

189
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,606
          Whoa!                 
          Whoa!                 

190
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,040
    What are you                
      doing here?               

191
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,714
     I didn't get a choice      
  about coming here to Earth,   

192
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,516
  and you didn't get a choice   

193
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,451
 about having to deal with me.  

194
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,487
            I'll...             

195
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,123
       I'll find another family 
             to live with.      

196
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,160
 S-- St-- Star.                 

197
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,428
          ( growling )          

198
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,763
        Star Butterfly!         

199
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,232
    At last I've found you!     

200
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,400
        Ludo!                   

201
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,402
 How did you know I was here?   

202
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,471
          ( chuckle )           
  Wouldn't you like to know?    

203
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,506
 Yes, that's why I asked.       

204
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:01,506
       Well, Buff Frog...       

205
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,377
 Hey, I don't have to tell you  
           anything!            

206
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,412
        Get her!                
                   ( roaring )  

207
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,349
           Hi-ya!               

208
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,685
   ( laughing)                  
You can fight?                  

209
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,087
             It's called karate.

210
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,525
            Karate!             

211
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,461
              You said          
    she was unguarded.          

212
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,729
              I don't know.     

213
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,566
            Hi-ya!              
             Huh?               

214
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,468
           Whoo-hoo!            

215
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,704
             Rainbow Fist Punch!

216
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,207
    ( growls )                  

217
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,777
             Haa!               
      ( horse neighing )        

218
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,481
You're embarrassing me.         

219
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,516
      Get up!                   

220
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,151
           ( growls )           

221
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,087
                 Jelly Bean     
             Hallucination Mist!

222
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,455
             Whoa.              

223
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,724
             What is happening? 

224
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,828
             Hi-ya!             

225
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,231
Mega Narwhal Blast!             

226
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,503
          ( groaning )          

227
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,710
STAR: You want some of this,    
            Ludo?               

228
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,812
                      No.       

229
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,513
            You see, you morons?

230
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,550
         This is what happens   
       when you don't work out. 

231
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,552
  Your muscles are like pudding.

232
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:21,820
                  Come on.      
             Back in the portal.

233
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,189
                   Back in      
               the portal.      

234
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,591
                 You even       
           retreat like losers. 

235
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,529
                I'll get you,   
              Star Butterf--

shove me off this cloud!

326
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,143
    Well, she also              
threatened to skewer me         

327
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,545
in the photo booth.             

328
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:46,551
            Yeah...             
    she can be possessive.      

329
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,153
    Pony Head, let's go to

      more fun there.

       Yes, you are right, Star.

335
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,697
      He will like              
the arcade better.

00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,546
       Eww.                     

355
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,448
  Oh, I'll go get us            
some nice cold icicles          

356
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,517
to put on your disgusting,      
       sweaty back.             

357
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,954
               Hey, you, Square.

358
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,589
        Have you seen this head?

359
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,525
               Don't lie to me, 
                  little man.

361
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,465
       Hah!                     
Who's the turd now?             

362
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,534
                    Still you.  

363
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,035
       I think I'm next.        

364
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,471
     But with less abusive      
      trash talk, please.       

365
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,208
        Um, let's see,          
   do I want the pointy one     
     or the pointier one?       

366
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,209
   Oh, it's such a tough choice.

367
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,644
Hey, Star, I'm bored.           

368
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,814
Uh, I know this other club.     
     So let's bounce.           

369
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,248
                Sounds cool.    

370
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,750
              I'll go get Marco.

371
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,785
Oh, no, no, no, no,             
 he went on ahead.              

372
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,955
Um, yes, he wanted to save us   
a good spot in the mosh pit.    

373
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,790
    Yes, that is                
the course of events.           

374
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,959
               Classic Marco.   

375
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,528
   Always putting friends first.

     Ha! Did you see that, Star?

379
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,871
 Try and beat that,             
       Pointy Head.             

380
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,140
        Star?                   

381
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,575
          Pointy Head?          

382
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,510
          ( heavy breathing )

       ( girls laughing )       

384
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,182
Is this not a blast             
  or what, B-Fly?               

385
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,352
     Yeah-heah! But I don't see 
           Marco anywhere.      

386
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,621

You got me, girl.               

387
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,223
And I'm way more fun.           

388
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,658
Uh, what are you talking about? 

389
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,228
        Uh, funny story,        

390
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,096
     you're gonna love it.      

391
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,931
I kind of ditched him and left  
  him in the other dimension.   

392
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:14,999
  Oops.                         

393
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,768
                  What?!        
              ( screams )

395
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,937
           How could you do that
            to my best friend?  

396
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,539
  Best friend?

 Last time I checked,           
the best friend was me.         

398
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,843
    I can have two best friends.

399
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,647
         Unless one of them     
     is a friend-ditching liar. 

400
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,317
That Earth Turd means           
  that much to you?             

401
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,255
      He's the best turd        
       I've ever known.         

402
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,091
       Okay.

                 I don't know!  

406

 Not talking, eh?               

407

                There he is.

00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,913
           Crystal Dagger--

00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,251
             Hold out your hand.

415
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,655
 Your dimensional scissors?     

416
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,624
              I won't need them 
              where I am going.

419
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,163
I heard you're looking          
 to ride with a pony.           

420
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,299

426
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,119
              Stand back, Marco.

427
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,087
   No, it's okay.               
 My hand is free--              

428
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,724
  Shiny Emerald Snake Strike!

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,263
                  Marco,        
           stop playing around.

00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,823
       ALL: Huh?  Run!          

435
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,331
Back off, creeps.               

436
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,766
         Don't worry, Pony Head,

440
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,780
         ( whinnying )          

441
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,384
             Hello, Daddy.      

442
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,286
        Hello, Princess.        

443
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,221
 What is he doing here?         

444
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,923
                      Oh, B-Fly,

00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,225
                it's the end    
             of the line for me.

446
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,426
           But at least I got in

447
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,261
           one last night of fun
              with you, girl.

 One last night?

00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,831
    Before what?                

450
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,468
                 Before this:   
        I'm going to St. O's!   

451
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,806
 Not St. Olga's Reform School   
   For Wayward Princesses?!     

452
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,742

               Oh, it's true.   
             I did it to myself.

454
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,215
      I'm headed to the slammer.

455
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,384
It's reform school,             
Cupcake, not jail.              

456
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,353
  Although admittedly           
it is a lot like jail.          

457
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,922
 Oh, Pony Head,                 

458
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,857
you knew you'd get              
sent to St. Olga's,             

459
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,260
but you still came back         
    to save Marco.              

460
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,729
             Ah, well, you know,

461
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,497
       it's hard to say it,     
   but he is your other bestie. 

462
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,765
                Okay, I said it.

463
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,235
Aww, come here.                 

464
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,803

465
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,074
All right, Princess,            
     time to go.                

466
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,510

             I'm gonna miss you.

467
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,112

468
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,349
     Good luck in Princess jail.

469
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:54,318
     Aw. Thanks, Earth T--      

470
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,387
   I mean, thank you, Marco.    

471
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,422
       But don't worry about me.

472
