20
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,550
            Where are you going?

21
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,752
           I thought you wanted 
           a goblin dog, right? 

22
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,887
Do you see                      
the goblin dog truck?           

23
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,089
      This is the place.        
        I am positive.          

24
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,525
You've been saying that         
for the last 12 dimensions,     

25
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:00,659
and I'm hungry.                 

26
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,561
I'm gonna go home               
and make a sandwich.            

27
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,729
      I think I found it!       

28
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,164
                    There it is.

29
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,565
     The goblin dog truck.      

30
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,569
That line is, like,             
a million miles long.           

31
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,337
         It's all good.         

32
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,406
      My friend Kelly's         
holding us a spot. Yo, Kelly!   

33
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,444
            Oh, hey, Kelly.     

34
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,547
                 Yo, Star, come 
             stand by me, girl. 

35
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,348
                Oh, my goodness.

36
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,751
                 We got so much 
             catching up to do. 

37
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,786
    Let's start doing it.       
       Not you, Marco.          

38
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,954
   You can stand over here      
      and talk to Kelly.        

39
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,123
          Hey, Kelly.           

40
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,393
      Uh, have you been         
        waiting long?           

41
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,428
                 That's so cute.

42
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,797
    You guys are basically      
    like the same person.       

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,033
Yeah, but, uh,                  
are you sure                    

44
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,535
you wanna wait                  
in this crazy line              
for just a hot dog?             

45
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,938
It's not                        
just a hot dog.                 

46
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,606
       It's a goblin dog.       

47
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,908
Some would kill                 
for a goblin dog.               

48
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,246
    Just like how I almost      
   killed you with that ax.     

49
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,316
    Just to be clear, I'm       
  the one who threw that ax.    

50
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,752
    I pulled myself out of      
 the ground for a goblin dog.   

51
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,788
       I'm a bit tender.        

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,090
              Oh, please, I had 
                   a goblin dog 

53
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,659
      - just last week,         
     and it was the bomb.

playing the music?

65
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,288
             Okay.              

66
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,690
                   I gotta have

00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,693
         'cause I like to float 
                like, five feet 
                off the ground, 

68
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,362
                  so it's like, 
                      I'm 4'6", 

69
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,864
       but with six-inch heels, 
      you know what I'm saying? 

70
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,867
  I mean, sometimes it feels    
    like they're the kids       

71
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,869
     and I'm the parent,        
          you know?             

72
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,375
    Whoa! You got another       
 one of those? I'm starving.    

73
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,646
You gotta be                    
kidding me.                     

74
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,214
        - What the...           
    - All right, kiddies.       

75
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:06,718
   You're just moments away     
from maximum mouth-ertainment.  

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,389
    So stay cool in a hot       
     goblin dog T-shirt.        

77
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,191

00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,726
         In my mouth.           
    I want it in my mouth.      

79
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,161
         - Excuse me.

80
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,563
       - You work here?         
            - Yes.              

81
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,698
  We've been waiting forever.   

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,967
       - How do we get          
        a goblin dog?           
     - You wait in line.        

83
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,871
And can you tell me             
how to get in that              
short line over there?          

84
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,373
        Oh, that's the VIP line.

85
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,808
      It's my boss' idea.       

86
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,743
How do we get                   
to the VIP line?                

87
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,913
      Well, it's pretty         
          exclusive,            

88
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:39,184
    but I could s-n-e-a-k       
         you guys in.           

89
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,852
       Oh, you know what?       

90
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,354
      I'm gonna go with         
        no, thank you.          

91
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:45,824
What? He just offered           
to sneak us in.                 

92
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,893
     Oh, what? I thought        
  he spelled something out.     

93
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,328
         That's my bad.         

94
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,564
                     Welcome to 
                  the VIP line! 

95
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:59,938
   Okay. Who's ready to buy     
  some goblin dog products?     

96
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,940
     That's okay. We just       
      want the hot dog.         

97
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,309
   You're in the VIP line.      
      That stands for...        

98
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,215
      Buy the products,         
      stay in the line,         

99
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,618
       - get the dogs.          
  - I don't have any money.     

100
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,186
                    Oh, I think 
                    I got some. 

101
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,754
               Check in my back 
                  pocket, girl. 

102
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,557
         Oh, uh-uh. No, I think 
                that's my keys. 

103
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,125
Oh, I found it.                 

104
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:24,029
         Uh, 27 cents           
  and two pistachio shells.     

105
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,597
 I got some cash.               

106
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,733
 Marco, how much money is that? 

107
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,202
      - Like 650 bucks.         
    - Yep, that'll do it.       

108
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,804
      This will get you         
    the executive package.      

109
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,741
     Man, this goblin dog stuff 
                 is ridiculous. 

110
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,610
        Yeah, you dropped a ton 
      of cash on all this swag. 

111
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,747
No, I got us into               
the right line.                 

112
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,415
              Oh, my gosh. Look.

113
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,751
          We're next!           

114
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,419
   Four goblin dogs, please.    

115
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,290
     Oh, you have to wait       
      in that line now.         

116
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,793
How many lines                  
are there?                      

117
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,795
     Oh, it's all one line.     

118
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,797
 There's just a lot of them,    
     so after that line,        

119
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,399
    you'll go to that line.     

120
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,800
       Then that line,          
       then that line,          

121
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,803
       then that line,          
       then that line,          

122
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,905
      then it hooks back        
      like a dog's leg,         

123
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,674
        then you gotta          
        take a number.          

124
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,676
     from a little number       
    ticket pulley thingy.       

125
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,844
   Okay, I'd like to speak      
   to the manager, please.      

126
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,113
                 Certainly, sir.

127
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,915
                       Yes?     

128
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,650
     What's the deal, man?      

129
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,420
     We waited six hours        
  and bought all your stuff.    

130
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,088
                 I'm sorry, sir.

131
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,858
  - Did you say you've been     
    waiting for six hours?      
            - Yes.              

132
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,362
  Well, some of these folks     
   have been waiting years.     

133
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,863
          ALL: Years?!          

134
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:37,102
                  Years!!       

135
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,805
         So what did            
       my manager say?          

136
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,840
    ALL: You're the manager!    

137
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,809
                 You know what? 
             Forget this, okay? 

138
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,945
   - I'm not waiting years      
  just to try a goblin dog.     
           - What?              

139
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,849
 Ponyhead, I thought you said   
 you had a goblin dog before.   

140
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,318
    Well, as it were, uh...     

141
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,221
  Have you had a goblin dog     
      or not, Ponyhead?         

142
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,956
       Uh, I don't know.        

143
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,059
        Who can tell?           
      Like... maybe not.        

144
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,362
         - I'm done.            
      - Marco, come on.         

145
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,030
   Ponyhead didn't mean bad.    

146
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,965
       She's just a liar.       

147
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,734
      ( angry muttering )       

148
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,702
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.         

149
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,704
       Wait? That's all         
      we've been doing.         

150
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,473
                    I'm sweaty, 
                    I'm hungry, 

151
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,309
  and on top of everything,     
 you lied about goblin dogs.    

152
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,911
Look, Marco,                    
I mean,                         

153
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,813
     all of these people        
          have lied.            

154
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,915
         She's right.           
         I lied, too.           

155
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,585
     I'm not the one who        
    threw this ax at you.       

156
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,887
Hi. My name's Stan.             

157
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,355
                  ALL: Hi, Stan.

158
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,357
 I'm also a liar.               

159
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,192
I told my wife                  
this was a mink coat.           

160
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,595
 It's just my body.             

161
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,230
      My glasses are fake.      

162
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,332
      Ooh, it feels good        
       to let that out.         

163
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,500
          These aren't my teeth.

164
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,435
           Look, we've all lied,

165
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:46,071
          and lying is not cool.

166
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,240
       But there's only         
       one person here          

167
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,075
       who has lied to          
          all of us.            

168
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,010
        Yeah. Ponyhead.         

169
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,378
           ALL: Yeah!           

170
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,514
       No. No, no, no.          
          That guy.             

171
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,285
          Oh, yeah.             
   He did lie to all of us.     

172
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,521
          - Get him!            
      - ( all yelling )         

173
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,290
      You're gonna lose         
     your place in line.        

174
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,263
        Look out, Marco.        

175
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,205
            Oh, no!             

176
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,840
      All right, Ponyhead.      

177
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,044
       He's getting away.       

178
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,247
 We lost him.                   

179
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,649
     Oh, no, we certainly       
           did not.             

180
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,884
         Grab on, turd.         

181
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,219
         I'm not sure           
    I like you calling...       

182
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,855
    Summoning cloudy charm.     

183
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,130
 Magnificence marshmallow mush! 

184
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,604
           ( groans )           

185
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,173
Okay, Roy, now get out          
the goblin dogs.                

186
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,108
              Okay, you got me, 
            severed horse head. 

187
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,244
  - Goblin dogs aren't real.    
           - What?              

188
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,180
         It's a ruse.           
  I took you for everything.    

189
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,849
      Come on, you guys.        
        Let's just go.          

190
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,984
            Look, kids, you can 
          have your money back. 

191
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,153
         You know what?         

192
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,022
          - Keep it.            
         - Uh, Marco,           
     that was 650 bucks.        

193
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:15,093
       Yeah. Well, now,         
 every time he sees my $650,    

194
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,929
he'll remember the three kids   
whose dreams he wrecked.        

195
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,699
 No, I'll just spend the money. 

196
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,300
 He's right, Marco.             

197
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,002
We'll take the money,           
okay, thanks.                   

198
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,338
  No, Star, we're going home.   

199
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,008
          ( giggling )          

200
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,111
     ( maniacal laughter )      

201
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,213
          What the...           

202
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,150
           - Star.              
   - ( laughter continues )     

203
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,018
        You've done it.         

204
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,120
   Ready when you are, Star.    

205
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:46,725
        No. You earned          
       the goblin dog.          

206
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,060
         What are you           
        talking about?          

207
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,329
    Goblin dogs are real.       
      I had one before.         

208
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,365
           - Kelly?             
  - Oh, we thought you died.    

209
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,833
                    MARCO: What?

210
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,067
                  No, we didn't.

211
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,702
       Oh, okay, well,          
          I'm sorry.            

212
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,205
    I thought she did die,      
        so excuse me.           

213
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,140
               Wait. You've had 
                  a goblin dog? 

214
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,074
        Got it from Roy.        

215
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,477
        So goblin dogs          
          are real?             

216
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,046
           They are.            

217
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,081
              Yes.              

218
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,683
         This was all           
     some kind of trick.        

219
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,485
          Not a trick.          

220
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,921
      A goblin dog must         
      choose its master         

221
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,556
        through trial,          
          and today,            

222
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,091
        the goblin dog          
         chooses you.           

223
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,062
           ALL: Wow!            

224
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,068
            Behold!             

225
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,705
 Oh, my gosh!                   

226
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,106
       ( all exclaiming )       

227
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,108
   Those aren't goblin dogs.    

228
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,655
     These are goblin dogs.     

229
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,926
          Oh, yeah!             
         Here, Pony.            

230
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,661
          Bon apetit.           

231
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,136
       This tastes like         
      a normal hot dog.         

232
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,138
It's basic                      
but it's good.                  

233
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,441
          Hm. Yeah.             
  I guess I was expecting...    

234
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,643
           ( gasps )            

235
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,848
          Goblin dogs!          

236
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,302
       That was amazing!        

237
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,337
           I gotta give it      
           to you, Ponyhead.    

238
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,339
         Those hot dogs         
         were pretty good.      

239
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,142
Oh, well, you know,             
the best for my besties,        

240
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,510
and whatever,                   
all that kind of stuff.         

241
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,312
But, you guys,                  
on the real,                    

242
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,147
I am so done                    
with this place.                

243
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,782
           I'm ready to hoof it.

244
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,985
Oh, no, you can't               
say that. No.                   

245
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,287
   Roy makes me go through      
       this every time.         

246
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,523
  Why are those goblin dogs     
           so good?             

247
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,992
Hey, Kelly, it's been           
really great talking to you.    

248
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,328
   Yeah, man, it was really     
cool hangin' out with you, too. 

249
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,263
           - What?!             
     - Oh, hey, I'm Tad.        

250
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,598
         I'm Kelly's            
          boyfriend.            

251
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,199
      You've been there         
       this whole time?         

252
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,201
           Yeah, I don't really 
                  eat hot dogs. 

253
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,570
         I'm a vegan and stuff. 
          But, you know, I like 
                   to hang out. 

254
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,109
       ( loud rumbling )        

255
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,857
     ( groaning )               

256
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,060
         I don't even           
      understand, girls.        

257
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,130
   This thing is impossible     
 to control... ( screaming )    

258
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,274
     Why won't you work?        
             Hm?                

259
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,478
         You can talk?          

260
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,981
     Tell me your secrets.      

261
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,418
        Star Butterfly?         

262
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,520
       But I don't want         
    to see Star Butterfly.      

263
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,322
       She doesn't have         
       a wand anymore.          

264
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,425
       Oh, you're right.        

265
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:11,496
   She doesn't need a wand      
 for me to steal her wisdom.    

266
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,432
    Girls, pack your things.    

267
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,902
      It's time to catch        
         a butterfly!           

268
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,775
          ( groaning )          

269
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,444
       I'm not good at          
      these new spells.         

270
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,114
 Why can't I just stick with    
       a normal blast?          

271
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,250
              Because there are 
     other spells in your book. 

272
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,885
          Yeah, but...          

273
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,020
                 Oh, Star. Look.

274
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,022
    This one's got pictures.    

275
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,290
                   Can we do it?

276
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,025
That's got                      
a lot of steps.                 

277
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,128
      Star, can you just        
    do the spell, please?       

278
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,029
     This book is so heavy.     

279
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,333
Ugh! All right.                 
( groaning )                    

280
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,271
      What do I gotta do?       

281
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,706
   Start with the first one.    

282
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,910
       Mmm, close enough.       

283
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,979
           I guess.             
   Now how about this one?      

284
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,949
       Okay, see, to me,        

285
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:09,120
     it looks like you're       
gonna wanna get both arms up,   

286
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,389
         like way up            
          together.             

287
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,458
                           More.

288
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,960
      Up and out, Star.         
         Look at me.            

289
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:16,961
              Huh?              

290
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,097
       All the way up.          
      Pointing at 11:00.        

291
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,800
         Earth 11:00            
       or Mewni 11:00?          

292
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,836
    They're the same, Star.     

293
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,504
    Ugh, this is impossible.    

294
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,107
       Look, I know how         
    to cast a spell, okay?      

295
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,441
      Twirl, twirl, twirl,      

296
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,976
       helicopter arms,         
       helicopter arms.         

297
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,745
      Warnicorn stampede!       

298
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,315
 See, I did it.                 

299
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,083
                      But, Star,

300
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,686
      that's a single warnicorn.

301
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,489
                  A stampede is 
               many warnicorns. 

302
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,457
                     ( laughs ) 
               I think somebody 

303
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,359
           needs to get back to 
       studying her spell book. 

304
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,195
             Help.              

305
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,763
   You know what, Glossaryck?   

306
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,199
        I'm done with           
     the book for today.        

307
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,334
Come on, Marco.                 

308
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,536
Let's go have fun               
with our friends.               

309
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:02,507
             Oh.                
  I thought we were friends.    

310
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,375
What? Oh, no, no, no, no.       

311
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,611
That's not what I meant.        
We're friends.                  

312
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,347
I just don't have               
fun with you.                   

313
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,649
But that is so fine,            
'cause it's not like            

314
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,218
you like having                 
fun, right?                     

315
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,154
Obviously. It's like            
you're alone all the time.      

316
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,189
Lonely people can be cool,      
like you.                       

317
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,726
 You're like a wise old hermit. 

318
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:26,564
 Or like a wise old monk.       

319
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,000
Or... or a...                   

320
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,735
like, I don't really know       
what you are...                 

321
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,837
             Wow.               
         Say no more.           

322
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,906
  I know when I'm not wanted.   

323
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,207
No, no, no.                     

324
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,809
   I won't be bothering you     
         ever again.            

325
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,478
Oh, my gosh.                    
I am so sorry, Glossaryck.      

326
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,846
Of course you're                
our friend.                     

327
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,748
               Uh, is he though?

328
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,251
               All this guy has 
               ever done for us 

329
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,253
      is hand out weird riddles 
               and eat pudding. 

330
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,989
Don't you talk like that        
about our friend, Marco.        

331
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,056
We have to                      
make it up to him.              

332
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,359
                All right. Look,

333
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,160
               my Uncle Enrique 
               hid in a box for 
               three days once. 

334
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,996
                     I know how 
                to handle this. 

335
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,567
  We can never be together,     
           Isobel.              

336
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,504
        We're from two          
      different worlds.         

337
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,474
 ( screeching )                 

338
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,914
             Society will never 
                     accept us! 

339
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,516
      See? Isn't this fun?      

340
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,019
   Just three good friends      
  watching a movie together.    

341
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,787
      'Cause that's what        
       good friends do.         

342
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,924
   Marco, please tell Star      
     we are not talking.        

343
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,560
    Star, Glossaryck said       
   he's still not talking.      

344
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,296
  Glossaryck, can you be nice   

345
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,431
 and pass this popcorn-candy    
         mix to Star?           

346
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,933
Hm, let me think.               

347
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,602
       - No, but I will         
         have these.            
            - Hey!              

348
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,437
       Oh, Boom Nuggets.        

349
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,272
         I know where           
        you're going.           

350
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,976
                   ( grumbles ) 

351
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,211
Hey, no big deal.               

352
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,113
     - I'll just make us        
      some more snacks.         
         - No, wait!            

353
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,215
      Cotton candy cloud!       

354
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,451
       That worked out better...

355
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,924
You know, it might not kill you 
     to study a bit more.       

356
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,726
 Don't you start, too, Marco.   

357
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,661
   Glossaryck, you'll miss      
       the whole movie          

358
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,296
     if you stay in there.      

359
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,497
     I thought you liked        
      romantic comedies.        

360
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,566
     Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.      

361
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,001
   I've seen this one before.   

362
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,970
      And the squid lady        
       dies in the end.         

363
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,372
        ( all groaning )        

364
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,646
         ( screeching )         

365
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,483
    I can't hold her back       
         much longer.           

366
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,185
      Glossaryck, help me.      

367
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,354
    Marco, could you do me      
    a favor and tell Star       

368
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,523
          she should ask one of 
 her Earth friends to help out? 

369
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,992
           ( burps )            

370
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,995
     You can stop, Marco.       
     He called our bluff.       

371
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,963
    ( screeches )               

372
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,598
        - Stop, Marco.          
         - Oh, sorry.           

373
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,569
 This is the most disgusting    
      dumpster in town.         

374
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,539
         The smell will get him 
                out of the box. 

375
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,109
All right. We're                
getting Glossaryck back.        

376
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,952
          Glossaryck!           

377
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,560
          What the...           

378
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,368
            Ludo?!              
         You're back?           

379
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,803
 Ludo's back!                   

380
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,338
           Yes, I am.           

381
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,040
         I tossed you           
       into the abyss.          

382
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,341
She tossed you                  
into the abyss.                 

383
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,709
         Yes, you did.          

384
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,812
           - What?              
            - Huh?              

385
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,815
   - BOTH: You have a wand?     
    - You both have wands.      

386
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,751
   Okay, seriously, Marco,      
   that's getting annoying.     

387
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,553
           Actually, he's right.

388
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,890
       Star Butterfly,          
    you're coming with me!      

389
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,896
      Rainbow fist punch!       

390
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,566
             What?              

391
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,268
             Ha ha!             

392
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,437
   That's your rainbow punch?   

393
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,646
         Heart attack!          

394
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,585
      This is the worst         
  wand fight I've ever seen.    

395
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,588
       Oh, no, I don't          
     have time for this.        

396
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,658
     Hey, we aren't done.       
       Come back here.          

397
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,667
           Seriously?           

398
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,271
      ( car alarm blares )      

399
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,487
             Nice.              

400
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,496
        Star, the lid.          
      It isn't holding.         

401
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,798
          Glossaryck!           

402
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,838
           Oh, no!              
         Glossaryck!            

403
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,707
              No!               

404
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,516
        Now, Princess,          
     I give you a choice.       

405
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:14,785
      Come with me or die.      

406
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,821
      Warnicorn stampede!       

407
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,697
    Fine. Have it your way.     

408
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,667
       It's going to be         
pretty hard to miss from here.  

409
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,768
             Star!              

410
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,344
              Om!               

411
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,580
        - Glossaryck?           
        - ( whistles )          

412
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,696
         What? A book.          

413
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,066
                      Now, read.

414
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,580
      Warnicorn stampede!       

415
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,788
         What is that?          

416
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,265
            - Oh.               
        - You did it!           

417
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,933
               That was so cool.

418
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,835
     Yeah, it was.              

419
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,770
And all I had to do             
was read from the book.         

420
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,839
      Well, my work here        
           is done.             

421
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,942
          Glossaryck.           

422
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,447
          I'm sorry             
    we hurt your feelings.      

423
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,082
                 Oh, you didn't 
              hurt my feelings. 

424
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,950
             I have no feelings.

425
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,052
                It was all part 
                   of the plan. 

426
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,054
What do you mean,               
part of the plan?               

427
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,558
  Yeah, why'd you lock yourself 
         in the donut box then? 

428
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,460
     I went into that box       
         on purpose,            

429
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,928
       because I needed         
    to get to that candy.       

430
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,796
                  Oh! Wait, why?

431
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,634
  Well, how would you rocket    
yourself from a trash compactor?

432
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,435
                          What? 
                  I don't know. 

433
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,804
  Marco, Marco, I had to be     
      in that donut box,        

434
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,573
       so I could land          
        at Ludo's feet          

435
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,308
        to trip him up          
      and save the day.         

436
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,943
                    Wait, wait. 
               So you're saying 

437
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,311
           you did all that on--

                      ( sighs ) 
                          Fine.

441

          Guess what.           

442
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,963
        There's a book.
