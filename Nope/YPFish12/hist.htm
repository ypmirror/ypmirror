<p><font size=5>HISTORY OF THE BRITISH SPOTTED PONY</font> <font size=4><strong><img src="link.gif" align=bottom width=38 height=34></strong></font><br>
<br>
The spotted coat of the British spotted pony was his natural camouflage when he roamed the heaths and forests of ancient Britain. Stoneage man painted him on the walls of his caves, 
and they appear in many illustrated manuscripts, old paintings and drawings down through the centuries. Because of their unusual coat colouring the spotted pony was highly prized and it 
is documented that they were sold for enormous sums of money and were widely used in peace and war. In a parchment roll dated 1298 there is listed all the horses purchased for 
Edward 1st campaign at Falkirk. It describes a spotted Welsh cob from Powys purchased from Robin Fitzpayne. He is one of the most expensive on the list. In a fifteenth century 
manuscript of the chronicles of Sir John Froissart there is an illustration of a little chestnut spotted cob.<br>
<br>
Due to our Celtic origins, and our subsequent worship of the horse goddess Epona we have our ancient fertility rites and dances, which have been passed on down through time and are 
still enacted by our Morris dancers and mummers in their plays throughout the country villages to this day. One of the characters in the mummers plays is the spotted hobby horse who 
represents spring growth and fertility. He would dance down the village streets and any fair maiden he could catch and touch was supposed to become pregnant. We know that 
somehow the spotted pony was linked with these ancient rites.<br>
<br>
The spotted pony was feral in the British Isles, and possibly was a well known colour amongst the Welsh hill ponies. We have many instances of spotted ponies in the old Welsh stud 
books and Gwynfe Hero, a spotted Welsh cob foaled in 1916, features in some of our oldest pedigrees.<br>
<br>
There have been some importation's of European blood down through the centuries. While the Roman army brought with them their elite officers mounts some of which were known to 
be spotted Spanish horses of great elegance. Also there were many gifts of fine horses sent between the royal families of Europe, and we snow from paintings and documents many were 
spotted. There is a mid nineteenth century print of a lady believed to be Queen Victoria driving a beautiful little Welsh-type spotted pony with a spotted Dalmatian dog running behind. 
Another recorded import (again of Spanish decent) was some Danish Knabstruppers in the early 1960's. Some stallions were also imported by Chipperfield's Circus for liberty work 
and some found their way into private hands. Some of our modern day stallions carry this blood through spangled Leopard who was by Flashlight of Derriott out of a Knabstrupper 
mare. Sparside buttons is an outstanding stallion of this old line. fairy King who was Welsh bred was the greatest progenitor of many of our ponies and he features through his son, Fairy 
Prince, in many of our oldest studs pedigrees. He strongly influenced the Dantsley, Domino, and Ypsitty studs who have in their turn sold stallions to many small studs throughout the UK 
and abroad.<br>
<br>
The British Spotted Horse and Pony Society was formed in 1947 to keep a register and preserve them, and in 1976 the society split and the ponies under 14.2 hh were looked after by 
the British Spotted Pony Society. The bigger ones were entered in the British Appaloosa Society registers.<br>
<br>
After the last war there was a great awakening of interest in the spotted pony and many were exported to Australia, America, Canada and Holland, France and Germany. The 
studbooks relate the constant loss of some of our best mares and stallions to the demand from abroad. During the 1960's and early 70's subsequently the British spotted pony has 
become a rare breed with about 800 animals currently registered in the society's studbooks.<br>

<strong>Breed Description: </strong><br>
The Connemara is famous for being hardy and sure-footed, and no surprise. The breed evolved on the rocky coast of western Ireland, where it had to develop an ability to move 
quickly across rough terrain. The sometimes harsh Irish weather and unforgiving landscape helped develop a breed that is resilient and adaptable, and today's Connemara is valued for 
all of these qualities. <br>

Breed History: <br>
The Connemara pony is Ireland's only native breed, with a history that some believe dates back to the ancient Celts. The Celts, who were skilled horsemen, developed the Pony from 
Scandinavian ponies that the Vikings first brought to Ireland<br>
<br>
Though much of the Connemara Pony's early history is based on legend and fable, it is also said that Spanish horses contributed to the breed after the sinking of the Spanish Armada 
when it ran aground in 1588 in the 16th Century, the shipwrecked Andalusians horses on board were set loose and swam to shore and interbred with the wild native ponies thus refining 
the local native wild ponies.<br>
<br>
For additional strength and stamina, Arabian blood was added in the 1700s. They were also crossed with Hackneys and Thoroughbreds. Too much crossbreeding began to dilute the 
pony bloodlines, so the Connemara Pony Breeders&#146; Society, founded in 1923, for the purpose of taking steps that would lead to the preservation and improvement of the Connemara 
Pony. <br>
The stud book was established in 1926. <br>
Early Irish farmers often had large families to feed and could afford only one good pony, which often came from a wild herd and had to be caught and gentled. Most families owned a 
mare so they could sell her offspring for much-needed income, and even while pregnant she would be required to pull a plow or a cart filled with rock, turf, or people. Any animal that 
couldn't perform these tasks on a daily basis was replaced. This difficult lifestyle helped the Connemara develop its trademark stamina and adaptability.<br>
Despite this long and colorful history, the Connemara didn't become an &quot;official breed&quot; until the Connemara Pony Stud Book was first published in 1926. The book was compiled by 30 
&quot;mostly local&quot; Connemara gentlemen, who were concerned about the dwindling population of local mares. The group formed the Connemara Pony Breeders Society with the sole 
purpose of promoting the best of these mares. In an effort to improve and invigorate the breed, the Society selected the best stallions from the area and persuaded local farmers to only 
use the services of those stallions.<br>
Today's Connemara is gaining popularity throughout the world as both an adult and children's pony. Its temperament and adaptability makes it well suited to a variety of disciplines, from 
jumping to dressage to endurance.<br>
The Connemara Pony Stud Book published in 1926. This was compiled by around thirty - mostly local Connemara gentlemen - who formed themselves into the Connemara Pony 
Breeders Society with the purpose of selecting a nucleus of ponies from the dwindling number of local mares and promoting them.<br>
<br>
Today, Connemara&#146;s are bred worldwide in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as on the European Continent, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South 
Africa.<br>

<font size=5>History of the Chincoteague Ponies</font> <font size=4><strong><img src="link.gif" align=bottom width=38 height=34></strong></font><br>
<br>
Because the Island is so remote, during the 1920s two fires devastated the Town of Chincoteague. In May 1924, determined that these events would not happen again, a small group of 
men organized the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company.<br>
<br>
By passing the hat, a sum of $4.16 was acquired and the fire company was launched. Mr. LeRoy Conant was elected president and Mr. Elba Jones, fire chief.<br>
<br>
At this meeting, the men discussed efforts to buy an American La France pumper (capacity 750 gallons) and 2,000 feet of hose. They opted for this purchase in June 1924. In order to 
pay for these pieces of equipment, the firemen held their first carnival, which included a &quot;Pony Penning Day.&quot; The proceeds were used as the initial payment on the equipment.<br>
<br>
With the exception of the war years, between 1942 &amp; 1943, the carnival and the penning have been sponsored by the fire company every year since its organization. That will make the 
1998 Event the 73rd Annual. All money realized from these events is used to carry on the work of the volunteer company.<br>
<br>
There are many &quot;legends&quot; concerning the origin of the ponies. One is that the ponies are descendants of ponies that swam ashore after a Spanish galleon wrecked off the coast of 
Assateague Island. Another is that the ponies are descendants of the horses put ashore by Spanish pirates. The U.S. Government maintains the ponies descend from domesticated stock 
that was grazed on the island in the 17th century by Eastern Shore planters seeking to avoid mainland taxes and fencing requirements.<br>
<br>
Whatever their origin, ponies have played an important part in the development of the the islands. They were used for transportation and work up until the early part of this century.<br>
<br>
Since the 1930s, the ponies have survived storms and diseases. They are deemed by the Federal Government as the only wild herd still grazing east of the Rocky Mountains. Currently, 
there are two herds of horses on Assateague Island separated by a fence at the Maryland-Virginia Border in the middle of the Island.<br>
<br>
The Northern, or Maryland herd, is managed by the National Park Service. The Southern, or Virginia herd, is owned by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company.<br>
<br>
The Southern herd is rounded up each year for the annual Pony Penning and Auction. After swimming across the bay between Assateague Island and the Town of Chincoteague on 
Chincoteague Island, the ponies are driven down Bunting Road to Main Street and then north to the Firemen's Carnival Grounds, where they penned and cared for. After the auction, 
the unsold colts are driven back to Assateague Island to the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge -- to survive another year in the wild.<br>
