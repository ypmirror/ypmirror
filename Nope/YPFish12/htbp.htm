<p><font size=5>How to BUY a PONY !</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=4><strong>Things You'll Need</strong></font><br>
<strong>1. Feed/water Buckets<br>
2. Hoof Picks<br>
3. Horse Vaccinations<br>
4. Grain/oats<br>
5. 8-foot Lead Rope<br>
6. Horse Comb/brush Set<br>
7. Pony-sized Halter</strong></p>

<font size=4><strong>Instructions</strong></font><br>
<br>
1. Go to horse auctions, visit local horse barns, read a book on how to buy a pony, or visit on a few horse-related Web sites. Become familiar with ponies before you 
pull out your wallet.<br>
2. Get some expert advice before making a purchase. It is difficult to select a sound pony with a good temperament unless you have a great deal of experience with 
ponies.<br>
<br>
3. Pay special attention to the personality of the pony you're considering buying, especially if a child will be riding her. If a pony is nippy, flattens her ears when touched, 
or bucks up her hind end when you walk behind her, it's best to bypass that animal.<br>
<br>
4. Examine the pony for cracked or deformed hooves, a runny nose or eyes, or a lethargic demeanor.<br>
<br>
5. Ask a horse veterinarian to examine the pony you've chosen. This is the best way to ensure you are buying a healthy pony. Pay special attention to the hooves during 
the vet check as ponies are vulnerable to foundering.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Tips &amp; Warnings</strong></font><br>
<strong>1. Consider buying a larger-size pony, even if the rider will be a young child. If the pony is too small, the child may quickly outgrow her.<br>
2. Avoid miniature horses for children; they are too small to be ridden.<br>
3.Consider the new owner's interests. If she wants to ride the animal, choose a tall, well-muscled pony. If she wants to let her pony spend her days 
grazing in a field, pick out a flashy, colorful, energetic pony.<br>
4. Expect to pay at least $600 to $3,000 for an unregistered pony.<br>
5. Do not buy ponies for young children unless an adult will have the time to supervise the pony's care. Ponies require just as much labor and 
commitment as do horses, and it is not safe to leave young children alone with these animals.<br>
6. Because of their size and inbreeding, ponies are more apt than horses to have mean streaks and serious medical problems.</strong><br>
