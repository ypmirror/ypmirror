                Thanks to the break between episode 21 and episode 22, we was able to do a little cleanup on the site !
                Now the two official mirrors support HTTPS, with a trusted certificate, so you don't have to bypass the warning !
                <br /><br />
                We also uploaded previous ponies to mega.co.nz, now everypony is downloadable from there !
                <br />
                <br />
                And finally, we removed the 720p links to newlunarrepublic (they will be removed from their server real soon)
                and replaced them by 1080p links.
