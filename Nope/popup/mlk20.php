  Last week, the crew behind My Little Karaoke - a song pack and  modification for UltraStar for singing along with various pony songs - <a href="http://www.mylittlekaraoke.com/index.php?post/Update%3A-Additional-Content-Disc-2">released a new content disc</a>.  The expansion provides a total of over 90 new songs according to the  developers, including foreign language versions of a few official songs  for you to improvise nonsensical lyrics over, as well as a bunch of  brony music of... varying quality. (I liked a couple of them, anyway.)  The update also comes with a new visual identity for the project.<br />
  <br />
You can find the download <a href="http://www.mylittlekaraoke.com/index.php?pages/Game-download">here</a>,  although the individual ZIP downloads of songs are no longer available,  leaving the only option to download...</p>
