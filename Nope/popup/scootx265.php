<p>Scootaloo HEVC are x265 encodes of iTunes US RAW by Scootaloo.    </p>
<p>Quality is better than iTunes raw thanks to Scootaloo color restoration process.</p>
<p> Audio tracks (Both AC3 5.1 and AAC) has been remastered, please use the AAC track on a stereo/laptop setup.</p>
<p> If you encounter frame drop, slow video playing, or simply can't play the file, please make sure your device is compatible with HEVC/x265 videos.    </p>
<p>You need MPC-HC 1.7.1+ or VLC 2.2.0+ on computers.</p>
<p>Most of the Scootaloo eps use many fixes to bring the best version in HEVC.</p>
