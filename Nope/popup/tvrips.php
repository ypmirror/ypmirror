<p> TVrips is the fastest format to come online with a correct quality, its not as great as iTunes ponies, it has watermark, doesnt have 5.1 audio for the majority and it has more mpeg artefact/noise than iTunes ponies, Those are the ponies you search if you want to watch it during the weekend, as iTunes episodes appear at monday since the Season 4.</p>
<p>Those are still some of the best TVRips version still maintened today, if you want to watch a TVRip, this is definitively the way to go !</p>
<p>Season 1 was encoded by Mentos.</p>
<p>All other seasons and currently released ponies are encoded by Spazz !</p>
