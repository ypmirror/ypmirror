<p> The Episode 6 from the Season 3 from iTunes has 7 audio glitch during the whole video (at 1:33, 2:48, 4:40,  8:16, 8:30, 16:21 and 16:43 ) , some (if not all !) desync the audio fron the video, making the iTunes version of this episode unwatchable</p>
<p>It was removed fron iTunes the 19th December 2012 at 10H PM GMT , We can hope a fixed iTunes version soon !</p>
<p>This version of the episode has been fixed by us and this is the correct version.</p>
<p>The fixed audio has been made by jonas93 using fragments from Terrier_RG audio.</p>
