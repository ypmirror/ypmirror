<p> The Episode 5 from the Season 4 on iTunes has a broken stereo, in fact, their Stereo track is in reality nothing but 2 duplicated mono track.</p>
<p>This version of the episode has been fixed by us and this is the correct version.</p>
<p>The fixed audio has been made by YayPonies, this is a downmix version of the original AC3 5.1 track.</p>
