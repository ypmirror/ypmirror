Hey, Starlight! Ready
to celebrate your first

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,360
Hearth's Warming Eve
here in Ponyville?

43
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,250
I was thinking I
might just skip it.

44
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,570
[gasp]

45
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,648
Derpy is Best Pony!

47
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,430
SKIP HEARTH'S WARMING EVE?

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,250
I just find it all
a little silly.

49
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,930
It's mostly a day dedicated to
presents and candy, isn't it?

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,520
And why would you deny
yourself presents and candy?

51
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,870
That's crazy talk!

52
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,020
I THINK what Spike
means to say is,

53
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,950
Hearth's Warming is about
more than presents and candy.

54
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,340
It's a time to spend
with friends and family

55
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,260
when we celebrate a
very important day

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,680
in Equestria's history.

57
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,510
I think to most ponies,
it's just an excuse

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
for silly songs and fun,

59
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,370
not a day to remember
some old story.

60
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,670
Maybe you just haven't
heard the right

61
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,510
Hearth's Warming
Eve story yet.

62
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,310
Earth ponies, pegasi
and unicorns sing songs

63
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,690
around a hearth to fight
back an eternal winter

64
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,470
caused by the
mythical Windigos?

65
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,050
[laugh] Every foal and
filly knows that story.

66
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,280
Not THAT one. My
favorite holiday story.

67
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,000
A Hearth's Warming Tale.

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Oooooo! I love that one!

69
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,600
This is the story of a powerful
unicorn named Snowfall Frost

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,570
who hated Hearth's
Warming Eve!

71
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,580
It all began many moons
ago in Canterlot...

72
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,920
Every home in Canterlot was
filled with Holiday spirit.

73
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,550
Every home except one.

74
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,670
It was said of Snowfall that
she was almost as studied

75
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,930
as Starswirl the Bearded.

76
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,650
Almost, since everypony knows
that Starswirl was an expert

77
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,500
at everything from
transfiguration,

78
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,960
Dimensional Calibration,
Teleportation--

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,390
Spike: We get it.
Starswirl's awesome.

80
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,610
Right. The point is, Snowfall
was also a powerful unicorn.

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,670
She wanted to be perfect.

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,200
Anything that got in the way
of that was a waste of time.

83
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,330
Ugh!

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,070
[clanging bells]

85
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,070
Well, that batch is
ruined. SNOWDASH!

86
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,780
Snowdash was Snowfall's
loyal assistant.

87
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,110
What do you need?

88
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,570
Get this mess cleaned up.

89
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,410
Those foolish ponies were
ringing those blasted bells

90
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,070
outside the window and
I lost my concentration.

91
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
Whoa. Ponies
actually enjoying

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,130
Hearth's Warming Eve. Where
did they get that crazy idea?

93
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,300
Today is nothing
to celebrate.

94
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,260
Hearth's Warming
Eve is a menace,

95
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,950
a dangerous day for
all of Equestria.

96
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,280
Dangerous? It's awesome!

97
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,980
It's the day we remember
how unicorns, pegasi,

98
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,010
and earth ponies came
together in friendship

99
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,880
to defeat the Windigos!

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,230
That silly legend
is the problem!

101
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,630
Telling everypony that
singing songs and being nice

102
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,200
will solve anything? I've
spent years studying magic

103
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,250
and that's not how it works.

104
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,810
I think you might be
missing the point.

105
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,140
Work hard, learn and use your
skills to better Equestria.

106
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,460
THAT'S a worthy
goal for anypony.

107
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,470
But by all means, if you
want to go home early,

108
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,090
ignore all of the work you
have and spend the rest --

109
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,250
SWEET!

110
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,000
Ugh.

111
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,250
I HATE Hearth's Warming Eve!

112
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,670
All of Equestria
would be better off

113
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,160

the day all together.

And they'll have
me to thank for it!

155
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,750
Wait a minute.

156
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,160
Snowfall doesn't like
Hearth's Warming Eve

157
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,500
so she decides to cast a spell
to get rid of it all together?

158
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,540
That seems a little extreme.

159
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,390
Says the pony who tried
to make everypony the same

160
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,870
by replacing their cutie
marks with equal signs.

161
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,630
I THINK what Spike is trying
to say is that everypony

162
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,020
has their reasons for doing
things. Even Snowfall.

163
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,200
And if I could
continue the story,

164
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,180
we might just find
out what they are.

165
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,590
Proceed.

166
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,520
Snowfall was all set to cast
her spell that would erase

167
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,500
Hearth's Warming
Eve for all time

168
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,100
when a voice from the hearth
caught her attention.

169
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,530
You SURE you wanna
go through with this?

170
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,220
[gasp] Who's there!

171
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,100
The Spirit of Hearth's
Warmin' Past, that's who.

172
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,130
And you and me have got
to have us a little chat.

173
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,300
A spirit! I didn't cast any
spirit-summoning spell.

174
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,250
What are you doing here?

175
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,360
You don't think a spell
like that would get by

176
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,320
without some powerful
forces noticing?

177
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,920
You've got our attention,
Snowfall Frost

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,430
and we've got some
pretty strong opinions

179
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,760
on this spell of yours.

180
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,590
We?

181
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,290
They'll be along in a bit.
For now it's just you and me.

182
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,690
Let's get a move on.
We got a ton to see

183
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,070
and barely any time
to see it.

184
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,190
[laugh] I'm not
going anywhere.

185
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,760
I've got a spell to cast. And
I don't need a history lesson

186
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,330
about Hearth's Warming Eve.

187
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,590
We aren't goin' to the past
to learn about the holiday.

188
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,410
We're goin' to
learn about you.

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,370

209
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,720
Decorating the classroom
for Hearth's Warming Eve,

210
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,900
Professor Flintheart!

211
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,100
You said you wanted to learn
to be a powerful unicorn,

212
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
did you not?
I do!

213
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,830
And what is the way that one
becomes a powerful unicorn?

214
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,340
[ahem] Work hard, learn
and use your skills

215
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,730
to better Equestria.

216
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,900
And how do these help
you to learn magic?

217
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,200
I want to be strong enough to
stop Windigos and help ponies!

218
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,770
That's just a story
we tell little ponies.

219
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,400
Real magic takes
time to learn.

220
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,290
[shatter]

221
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,450
It's your choice.

222
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,590
Spend your time learning to
become a powerful unicorn,

223
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,430

make nothing of yourself.

[gasp] Spirit? What
am I supposed to--

238
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,970
SNOWFALL FROST! IT IS I,

239
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,330
THE SPIRIT OF HEARTH'S
WARMING PRESENTS!

240
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,160
Um, don't you mean
present, like, the time?

241
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,140
No. Toys, Hearth's Warming
dolls. Here! Want a cupcake?

242
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,610
Fine. Presents. All of
the pointless things

243
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,410
that ponies waste
their time on.

244
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,650
Oh Snowfall. It's not what
the gift is that matters,

245
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,570
it's what the gift MEANS!

246
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,810
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just stuff.

247
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,800
Exactly! Sometimes a
cupcake means I love you!

248
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,750
Or a toy means Hi!
How ya doin?

249
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,830
And sometimes a book means,
"Your mane looks AMAZING!"

250
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,260
And sometimes a scarf means...

251
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,060
well, a scarf usually
means you look cold.

252
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,490
That one's easy.

253
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,180
I don't understand
anything you're saying.

254
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
Whoa, whoa! [grunt]

255
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,120
What's happening to you?

256
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,560
My Spirit of Hearth's Warming
Presents-sense is going off!

257
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,050

[laugh]

294
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,000
So [sigh] what happens next?

295
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,660
Well, the party was--

296
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,550
WAIT! Can we take
a quick break?

297
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,490
I need to refill my cocoa!

298
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,010

almost to the best part!

00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,950
OK. I'm ready.

301
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,750
The party was in full swing.

302
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,300
Snowdash!

303
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,720
Hey, Merry.

304
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,480
Why, whatever is
the matter, darling?

305
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,780
Was it the eggnog?

306
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,350
[sigh] I knew I put
in too much cinnamon.

307
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,350
Oh, no! The eggnog was
awesome, Flutterholly.

308
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,810
I'm just mad at somepony
who was complaining

309
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,890
about how awful
Hearth's Warming Eve is.

310
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,030
I don't suppose that pony's
name starts with "Snow"?

311
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,950
And ends with "frost"?

312
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,490
She said Hearth's Warming Eve
is just an excuse to party

313
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,130
and we'd all be better
off spending time working

314
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,250
to make Equestria
a better place.

315
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,080
Boo!

316
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,480
What does Snowfall think a
better Equestria looks like?

317
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,410
Ponies working hard.

318
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,190
Learning.

319
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,430
And using their abilities for
the benefit of Equestria.

320
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,680
[giggle]

321
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,351
Yeah! [laugh] [cheers]

322
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,260
It looks like we've got
everything on Snowfall's list

323
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,400
right here.

324
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,160
I think a perfect
Equestria looks a lot like

325
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,940
a Hearth's Warming Eve party.

326
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,590
Me too. Too bad it's going
to be the last one EVER!

327
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,830
Ever...ever...ever.

328
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,380
Spirit? What do you mean?
What's going to happen?

329
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,540
[whistling wind]

330
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,540
Who are you?

331
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,840
I am the Spirit of Hearth's
Warming Yet to Come.

332
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,240
Are you here to show me

333
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,400
what future Hearth's
Warming Eves are like?

334
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,130
No. For there are no more
Hearth's Warming Eves

335
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,220
for me to show.

336
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,450
Why not?

337
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,960
You will succeed in erasing
the holiday as you wished.

338
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,670
And what happens?

339
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,310

WINDIGOS!? They
aren't real.

352
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,530
It's just a little
filly's story!

353
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,870
They are all too
real, Snowfall.

354
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,530
And your actions will
allow them to return.

355
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,970
The future of Equestria
shall be bathed in a blanket

356
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,460
of eternal snow.

357
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,440
No! I never meant for this to
happen. I didn't understand!

358
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,580
I didn't see how important
Hearth's Warming Eve was!

359
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,610
Please, spirit! I haven't
cast the spell yet!

360
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,890
Is there still time?
I'm sorry!

361
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,290
There's still time!

362
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,580
Oh my.

363
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,420
Snowfall Frost?

364
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,810
I was hoping I wasn't
too late for the party.

365
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,530
I brought gifts.

366
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,750
[spits] Boss?

367
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,493
I was wrong earlier. About
Hearth's Warming Eve.

368
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,040
It's not all about
singing and presents.

369
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,800
The singing and presents
are all about celebrating

370
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,310
the ponies in our lives.

371
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,790
The ponies we should listen
to more often. Our friends.

372
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,470
Wow.

373
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,060
Dragon toenail? Uh...thanks?

374
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,560
I was in a hurry. I'll
do better next time.

375
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,180
[laugh] You kidding?

376
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,700
No one's ever given me
dragon toenail before!

377
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,410
It's awesome! Now
come get some eggnog!

378
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,180

The end.

382
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,300
Well, that's it. Thanks for
letting me read you the story.

383
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,300
Guess you can call
it a night.

384
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,220
Spike and I are
heading downstairs.

385
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,090
And if you wanted to, you'd
be welcome to join us.

386
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,370
[giggling]

387
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,890
Welcome to the party. Happy
Hearth's Warming Starlight.

388
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,970

Warming, Twilight.
