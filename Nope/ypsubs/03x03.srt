1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,770
Try again, Twi.
You can do it.

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,250
Phew!
This spell's a toughie.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,120
But I feel lucky this time.

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,896
One, two...

5
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:18,860
One, two...
- Hi!

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,730
Pinkie, why'd you do that?!

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,190
'Cause hugs are funeriffic!

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,200
Especially when you throw one
around a friend.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,450
Whatcha doin'?

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,860
Trying to turn that apple
into an orange!

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,130
But you kind of threw her aim off.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,800
Whee!
What a cute orange birdie!

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,550
Do me next, Twilight!
Do me! Do me!

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,050
Ooh! Rarity, wanna see Twilight
turn me into an orange?

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,400
It's gonna be funna-fun-fun!

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,670
As fun as creating an
haute-couture ensemble

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,150
that I just finished making?

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,310
Delightful, no?

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,810
This is terrible!

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,500
I admit it's perhaps not
my finest work, but I--

21
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,200
You had total, awesome, amazing fun,
and I missed out on it?!

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,500
Wait.

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,500
What if there's more awesome,
amazing fun with friends

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,920
happening somewhere
in Ponyville right now

25
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,300
that I'm missing out on too?!

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,900
We weren't gonna turn her
 into an orange. I swear!

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey, Rainbow Dash.
Whatcha doin'?

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,890
This punk cloud got so heavy,
it's making fog.

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,800
Figure I'll thin this bad boy out
so it floats back up.

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,240
Ooh! Fun!

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Gotta go!

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,750
Thanks, Pinkie?

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,400
Hey, Applejack.

34
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,500
That looks like fun.
Can I join you?

35
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,000
Whee!
Next time, I'll pull you.

36
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,660
Fluttershy!

37
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
There...

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,100
There... you...

39
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,820
There... you... are...

40
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,370
doing...

41
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,530
doing... anything...

42
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,690
doing... anything... fun?

43
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,780
Not especially.

44
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,890
Oh, good.
Fun is hard!

45
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,450

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,690
Feeling better, Pinkie?

49
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,120
Abso-tutely-lutely!

50
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,800
Thanks for letting me rest in
your butterfly grove

51
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,650
while I get
my Pinkie strength back.

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,360
What are friends for?

53
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,560
That's just the thing!

54
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,300
I've got so many wonderful friends
having fun in every last corner of Ponyville

55
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,560
I can't figure out how
to keep up with it all.

56
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,680
It's driving me even more
coco-loco than usual!

57
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,060
I can promise to not do anything
fun at all if that would help.

58
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,580
You are such a good friend.

59
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,890
There you are, Pinkie.

60
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,360
Been looking everywhere for you, girl.

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,030
Been looking everywhere for you, girl.
- Hey, Pinkie.

62
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,900
Got something fun planned this afternoon.
Thought you might wanna know about it.

63
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,060
Well, I'll be an apple crisp.

64
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,700
I'm here for the same reason!

65
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,500
This is perfect!

66
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,000
Everyone will now
bring their fun to me.

67
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,050
This will solve everything!
Why didn't I think of that?

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,470
Actually, what I meant is
after I'm done whipping up today's weather,

69
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,750
I'll be chilling by the lake
catching some rays.

70
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,650
- Wanna hang?
- I am so there!

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,670
And my family's having a barn raising
this afternoon at Sweet Apple Acres.

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,300
And I'm also so there!

73
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,410
Whee! Whee!

74
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,300
But that's when I'll be
at the swimming hole.

75
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,780
Oh, well.
Doesn't matter.

76
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,450
Whichever one you choose
is okay with me.

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Me too.

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,400
Choose?

79
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,200
One... two...

80
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,370
Pinkie!

81
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,220
What in the wide-wide world
of Equestria are you doing now?

82
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,800
Timing myself
galloping back and forth

83
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,550
between the swimming hole
and Sweet Apple Acres.

84
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,390
I'm trying to cut down my time
so Rainbow Dash dives off the swing,

85
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,850
I can get to Sweet Apple Acres
to help with the barn raising,

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,950
and then be back in time
to see Rainbow Dash hit the water

87
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,800
after doing a double flip.

88
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,940
If I can cut my time by only 20 minutes,
I'm good.

89
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,590
Oh, Pinkie.

90
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,940
I'm afraid no matter
how hard you try,

91
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,560
the only way to
pull something like that off

92
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,450
is if there's more of you
to go around.

93
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,480
That's it, Twilight!

94
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,040
The legend of the Mirror Pool!

95
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,160
The legend of the who-what now?

96
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,540
Pinkie!

97
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,440
I'm familiar with loads of legends,
and I never heard of--

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,980
Does this mean practice is over?

99
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,860
Of course not.
Back to work.

100
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,800
Seems like hardly
anypony's been here in ages.

101
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,770
I hope I'm remembering the rhymes right
from my nana Pinkie story.

102
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,860
Where the brambles are thickest,

103
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,710
there you will find... huh...

104
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,190
a pond beyond
the most twisted of vines.

105
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,990
Who's there?!
I heard a voice!

106
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,610
Oh.
It was me.

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,280
Ouch! Oh!
Stop scratching me up, brambles!

108
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,620
The Mirror Pool!

109
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,740
Oh, and there's that voice again.

110
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,706
Ah, Pinkie.

111
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:30,435
You have got to stop
talking to yourself.

112
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,840
Starting... now.

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,760
And into her own reflection she stared,

114
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,210
huh... yearning for one
whose reflection she shared

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,850
and solemnly sweared not to be scared

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,260
at the prospect of being doubly mared!

117
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,680
Whee-hee!

118
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,490
Wow. The legend is true.
It really worked!

119
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,900
Okay, wait, I promised
not to talk to myself anymore.

120
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,380
I should say something to her.

121
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,070
Or... would that still be
talking to myself?

122
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,650
Excuse me, me?
Can I have word with you?

123
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
Uh, I mean, me?

124
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,630
Listen, I can see you're having lots of fun,
but--

125
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,050
Fun!
Did somebody say 'fun'?

126
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,990
Where?

127
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,250
Where?
- I did, over here.

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,650
I thought someone said
something about fun.

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,300
Where is it? Over here?
Over here?

130
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,880
I don't see it.
Where is it? Where is it?

131
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,100
Oh, calm yourself.

132
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,770
There's loads of fun to be had
in Ponyville with my girls.

133
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,500
Trot on over back to Ponyville with me,
and I'll tell ya all about them.

134
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,990
And then there's Rarity.

135
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,600
She's the one with all
the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff.

136
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,180
I'm thinking she can make us all
matching t-shirts that say 'team Pinkie' and--

137
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,170
Is this Ponyville?
Where's the fun? Where's the fun?

138
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,400
Uh, well, let's see.
Applejack's having a barn raising at--

139
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,850
It's thataway!

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,250
Wait!
Come back!

141
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Don't forget to meet me back here
to tell me everything about everything.

142
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,950
Like I was there myself.

143
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,140
Because I'm you and...
and you're me, and--

144
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,700
Oh my gosh!
This is the greatest plan ever!!

145
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,000
Now, off to double my fun!

146
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,840
Let's rock this pool, ponies!

147
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,700
Coming in, Dashy?
The water's great.

148
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,400
It's totally wet and everything.

149
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,480
I don't know.

150
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,400
Cloud busting was tougher work
than usual, today.

151
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,020
I'm kind of exhausted.

152
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,080
That's fine.
You relax.

153
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,020
At least we'll still be together.

154
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,400
Glad you made it, Pinkie.

155
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,650
I thought you maybe went
to Applejack's, instead.

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,170
- I did.
-Oh. The Barn up yet?

157
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,070
I have no idea.

158
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,760
But I thought you said
you were just at Applejack's.

159
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,550
Actually, I'm probably still
on my way there now!

160
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,220
Whee!

161
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,590
Oh, Pinkie Pie.

162
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,890
I'm so glad you wandered by.

163
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,260
I know I promised
not to have any fun today, but

164
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,600
I couldn't help myself.

165
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,780
All of my critter friends wanted a picnic,
and I couldn't disappoint them.

166
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,800
Come join us.

167
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,860
We have plenty of hay juice
and marmalade to go around.

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,650
Don't we, critters?

169
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,700
Wait!
That sounds super fun!

170
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,330
But Applejohn sounds super fun too!

171
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,760
And-- and-- I can't do one
without missing out on the other!

172
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,400
Who's Applejohn?

173
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,470
Two fun things at once!
But which-- which--

174
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,560
Can't decide!

175
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,140
Trouble breathing!

176
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,410
Walls closing in!

177
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Walls?
But we're outside.

178
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,230
Goodness.
Was it something I said?

179
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Yes!

180
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,180
So, you see, that's how I'm able
to have fun in two places at once.

181
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,910
Duplicates of you, huh?

182
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,410
Yeah, sure, Pinkie.

183
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,660
Look, I was just gearing up
to catch some Z's. So uh...

184
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,020
Gotcha!
I'll have the rest of my fun very quietly.

185
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,380
How'd you do that?

186
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,510
Just trying to show a little consideration
for my sleepy friend.

187
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,380
Ooh! Ooh!
Gotta run!

188
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,450
Looks like I'm trying to
get my attention.

189
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,980
- Excuse me.
- And me.

190
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,500
Ooh! Ooh!
Tell me all about it.

191
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,240
Did they pull the walls of the barn up
slooow... or fast?

192
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,740
Maybe slow to medium-fast?
Somewhere in that range?

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,630
Ooh!
Did you get ice cream?

194
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,200
What kinds did they have?
Banana brickle?

195
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,470
I didn't make it!

196
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,050
I was on my way there,
and then Fluttershutter--

197
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,550
Fluttershy.

198
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,930
Yeah! Her! She offered
something else fun for me to do.

199
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,210
A picnic!
With cute little animals.

200
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,220
How could you say no to that?

201
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,950
That's what I'm saying!

202
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:51,100
Then I would have missed the super fun thing
with Applesauce!

203
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,010
Applejack.

204
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,270
So I didn't do
anything fun at all!

205
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,030
Oh, my poor, poor me.
There, there.

206
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,600
Tell me what.
We just need a couple more Pinkie Pies.

207
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,940
- Easy-peasy.
- Really?

208
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,390
Come on.
Would I lie to me?

209
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,380
And solemnly sweared
not to be scared

210
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,900
at the prospect of being
doubly mared.

211
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,210
Look!
A double me!

212
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,500
I think you mean
a double-double me?

213
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,120
Plus another double-double me,
which makes two double-double me's,

214
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,790
or a double-double-double me,
if you will.

215
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,960
Did somebody say 'fun'?
Where? Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!

216
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,990
Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash
and Fluttershy are covered

217
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,140
plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case
we get an extra invite from somepony else.

218
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,090
Perfect!

219
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,990
Okay, let's go!

220
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,730
And solemnly sweared

221
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,980
not to be scared,
at the prospect of being doubly mared!

222
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,700
Okay, good enough.
Pinkie Pies, moving out--

223
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,450
...not to be scared,
at the prospect of being doubly mared!

224
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,820
What in the name of pink?!

225
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,990
Knock it off!

226
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,750
To Ponyville, everyone!
Follow me!

227
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,530
Yes, it's fun there.

228
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,550
Okay, between the bunch of us,

229
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,560
we should have every nook and cranny of fun
in Ponyville covered, at all times.

230
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,200
An unprecedented
and massive undertaking!

231
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,020
But first,
a pop quiz on the names I taught you!

232
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,590
Applejack!

233
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,820
Fluttershy!

234
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,550
Pinkie Pie!

235
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,570
Excellent!

236
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,450
Okay,
let's get on with this, folks.

237
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,700
Fan out on three.
One--

238
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,670
Eh, good enough.

239
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,520
What the--

240
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,690
Wow! Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding
about the duplicates!

241
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,440
Except now there's triplicates...
and quadruplicates!

242
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,280
Dash is gonna love this!

243
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,030
If I push her around on this floaty thing,
it'll be fun, and relaxing!

244
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,280
Uh oh...

245
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,510
No more Pinkies!
I can't take it!

246
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,210
Gosh, uh...

247
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,750
I wonder what fun they're having raising
the barn at Applejack's right now!

248
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,140
Maybe I'd better go check!

249
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,070
Oh, phew!
Looks like I haven't missed a thing!

250
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,630
I wanna know right now
where all you Pinkies came from

251
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,550
so I can find out who's responsible for
y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'!

252
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,350
Uh, you look pretty busy right now,
so...

253
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,250
maybe we should talk a little later?

254
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,710
Y'all come back here and clean up
after yourselves this instant!

255
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,100
Oh no, what have I done,
what have I done?!

256
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,980
My poor friends...

257
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,980
Okay, everypony,
please, calm down!

258
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,540
Calm down?!

259
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,910
I have just had a Pinkie hurricane
raging through my shop!

260
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,240
And they trashed our critter picnic!

261
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,300
Please, everypony, hang on
while I try to figure something out!

262
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,040
Come on, Spike.

263
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,210
I've gotta try to remember
the name of that legend she mentioned.

264
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,840
Ah, here it is!
"The legend of the Mirror Pond".

265
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,060
It describes a spell I can use to send
them back where they came from!

266
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,750
That's perfect, let's go!

267
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,100
But there's a catch.

268
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,500
If I can't figure out which one's the real Pinkie,
I might send her back by mistake!

269
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,720
Well, we'll just have to figure out
who the real one is then.

270
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,830
Shouldn't be too hard.

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,790
Does anypony here know how we can tell
the real Pinkie from all the rest of them?

272
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,960
Twilight! I have to talk to you,
I need your help!

273
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,940
Excuse me, whoever you are,

274
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,000
but I'm not talking to any of you Pinkies
unless you're the real Pinkie.

275
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, but, I am the real Pinkie!

276
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,840
No you're not,
I'm the real Pinkie!

277
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,150
I'm the real Pinkie!

278
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,180
I'm the real Pinkie!
- No, I'm the real Pinkie!

279
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,530
I'm the real Pinkie!

280
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,900
I'm the real Pinkie!
- No, I'm the real Pinkie!

281
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,390
I'm the real Pinkie!

282
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,800
How in tarnation are we supposed
to tell which is the real Pinkie?

283
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,230
I have no idea.

284
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,450
Me either.

285
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,200
We've all got the same adorable tails,

286
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,360
we've all got the same adorable manes,

287
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,950
we've all got the same adorable hooves!

288
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,220
Which one of us is the real Pinkie?!

289
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,810
I haven't the slightest clue!

290
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,740
And if I can't tell us apart...
who can?

291
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,180
Ugh, this is hopeless!

292
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,850
Maybe that one's the real Pinkie.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,140
Please. The real Pinkie Pie never sat
that long in one place for her whole life!

294
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,150
I'm gonna go ask.

295
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,060
Of course she's gonna say
she's the real Pinkie! They all do!

296
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,590
You're wasting your time.

297
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,700
So, lemme guess.
You're the real Pinkie Pie.

298
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,000
Heck if I know!

299
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,150
Could be any one of us,
if you ask me.

300
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,690
And if I said I was the real Pinkie,
you wouldn't even believe me anyway.

301
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,150
So just leave me alone.

302
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,240
I've got some important poking around
with my hoof to do.

303
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,290
Oh Spike, how're we gonna do this?

304
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
I can't risk sending the real Pinkie
back into the pond!

305
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,120
I miss the real Pinkie.

306
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,740
I bet she misses you too.

307
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,230
Bet she'd do just about anything
to get to be with her friends again.

308
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey, hey!

309
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,590
What if you gave them a test?

310
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,150
Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do,
something not fun at all!

311
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,560
Any Pinkie that can't do it
goes back into the pond.

312
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,550
But whoever wants to stay the most,
that must be the real Pinkie!

313
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,170
You know, that's not a bad idea.

314
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,990
This is great! If I pass,
I get to be with my friends again!

315
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
But what if I don't pass?

316
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,910
What if I'm not the real Pinkie Pie?!

317
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,010
Stupid magic mirror water!

318
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,850
This is all your fault!

319
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,000
And mine.

320
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,810
Hey, Twilight!

321
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,480
I've been looking all over for you ponies.
What are you all doing here?

322
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,520
Fluttershy spoke
with the woodland critters,

323
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,990
and they've agreed to take us into their
home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down.

324
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,260
You guys, we're gonna fix this.
And I know exactly how.

325
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,300
Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie?

326
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,480
I don't think so.

327
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,810
Now come along.

328
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,100
I've already got Applejack and her family
rounding up all the Pinkies.

329
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,620
Hyah, Pinkies, hyah!

330
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,950
Ooh, they wanna play chase!
This is fun, too!

331
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,510
Oh, give it a rest.

332
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,780
Welcome, Pinkies, welcome.

333
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,520
Please have a seat and
make yourselves comfortable.

334
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,700
Okay, I suppose you can't be
comfortable staying in one place,

335
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,370
but have a seat anyway.

336
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,490
Sit down!

337
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,900
Better. Now, I suppose
you're all wondering

338
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,780
why I've gathered you
all here today.

339
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,260
For fun?

340
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,600
No, just the opposite, actually.

341
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,900
Wait up,
I got one more!

342
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,050
I found this one poking at the ground
with her hoof and drawing frowny faces.

343
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,760
Have her come sit with the others.

344
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,140
Pinkies, you've been brought here
to take a test.

345
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,560
Don't worry, it's a simple test.
About as simple as they come.

346
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,700
And whoever passes gets to stay.

347
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,150
Curtain, please.

348
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,040
The test will be watching paint dry!

349
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,870
On your mark, get set, go!

350
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,530
Whoa, this is so exciting!

351
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,830
Okay, maybe not that exciting.

352
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,050
Oh, hey, look at the birdie!

353
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,750
Watch me bounce
and touch the ceiling!

354
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,000
Is that... is that a frog
crossed with an orange?

355
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,750
- Cool!
- Where?

356
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,300
Look what I can do
with my hooves!

357
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,663
Betcha can't make a face
crazier than...

358
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:30,764
this!

359
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,450
I can't take it any more!

360
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,900
Somepony's making balloon animals!

361
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,470
What? Where?

362
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,710
Pinkie,
you can look away now.

363
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,610
- I passed?
- You passed.

364
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,110
You're the only Pinkie
who kept staring at the wall.

365
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,160
I had to, I just had to.

366
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,730
I couldn't leave my friends,
I just couldn't.

367
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,290
But I guess sometimes
I will have to choose between them.

368
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,320
I knew you'd be up to the challenge.

369
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,620
I'm me! I'm me!
I'm meeee!!

370
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,550
Or am I?

371
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,570
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am.

372
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,500
Dear Princess Celestia,

373
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,080
it's great to have fun,

374
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,850
but it's even greater
to have great friends.

375
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,250
And having lots of friends means that
you sometimes have to make choices

376
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,950
as to who you spend your time with.

377
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,290
But that's okay,
because good friends

378
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,000
will always give you
lots of opportunities to have fun.

379
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,780
So even if you're missing out,
it's never for long.

380
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,350
Respectfully yours,
Pinkie Pie.

381
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,400
Hi Pinkie Pie,

382
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,570
we were thinking
we should go out and celebrate.

383
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,660
You up for some wheelbarrow races?

384
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,190
Or I could take everypony
on a cloud ride!

385
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,330
I could throw a party with punch
and zesty cucumber sandwiches! Ooh!

386
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,010
You wanna know exactly
what I feel like doing right now?

387
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,400
That looks like fun.
