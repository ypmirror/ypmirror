1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,560
The last time I was here,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,740
I woke them and ended up
with a mane full of bats!

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,180
Thanks for being
my basket holder, Spike.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,080
Basket holder? I thought
I was your bodyguard.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,420
What? Oh yes, yes.
That of course, too.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,560
Oh for once I wish
unicorn magic wasn't so...

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,920
luminescent.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,760
Spike, you'll wake the
bats! Turn that off!

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,430
I can't! Oooh!

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:59,800
Hearing impaired subtitles
by YayPonies
We have muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,100
<i>I'm so glad</i>
<i> you two could come.</i>

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,500
Of course. We so
rarely get a chance

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,860
to relax and just visit.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,520
There's usually some crisis
we have to deal with.

15
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,520
Somepony always needs
our help. But today--

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,120
HELP! Twilight! There's
something wrong with Spike!

17
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,560
What's wrong?

18
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,020
I don't know!
All of the sudden

19
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,840
my scales just started
glowing and burning.

20
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,060
Little is known
about dragon culture,

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,920
but this is a phenomenon
we've seen before.

22
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,500
It is the Call of
The Dragon Lord.

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,240
Dragons glow whenever
the Dragon Lord

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,320
has need of them
in the Dragonlands.

25
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,100
Great! How
do I make it stop?

26
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,420
The only way to end the
summons is to answer it.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,340
You must journey
to the Dragonlands

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,040
and see what is
expected of you.

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,800
But the Dragonlands
are full of... dragons!

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,620
And they're
ghastly creatures!

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
Oh-oh not you of
course, Spikey Wikey.

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,220
But remember that
rotten Garble?

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,300
How could
I forget?

34
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,780
He would have burnt us to a
crisp if you weren't there.

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
If I have to go to
the Dragonlands,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,980
would you two come with me?

37
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,680
Oooh! Oh my goodness! I'd
love to! We are sadly lacking

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,780
any information on dragon
culture and customs.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,140
I could research them, maybe
even write an article!

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,440
This could be my chance to
make a great contribution

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,800
to the knowledge of Equestria!

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,480
And be there for
Spike, of course.

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
Be very careful.

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,460
The Dragonlands are
particularly dangerous

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,460
for ponies. It would
be wise to be discreet.

46
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Oh, I'm sure I still have
the dragon costume we used

47
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,420
the last time we snuck into
the Dragonlands!

48
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,080
I think we might
want something

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,900
a little more
practical this time.

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,340
Well, it may
be practical,

51
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,020
but this disguise isn't
flattering in the slightest!

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,260
It's not supposed
to be flattering;

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,860
it's supposed to blend in!

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,650
SHHHH!

55
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,100
Hey, look. It's our old
friend, Sparkle Warkle.

56
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,430
It's Spike.

57
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,270
Are you sure your pony friends
didn't give you a pony name?

58
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,340
It's nice to see
you too, Garble!

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,300
I didn't say it was nice
to see you. It's not.

60
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,080
I don't like you.

61
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,280
Was I not clear about that?

62
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,780
Hey! That's my rock.

63
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,260
Oh really? Then why
aren't you sitting on it?

64
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,480
Dragons of Equestria! Hear me!

65
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,800
I have been Dragon
Lord for longer

66
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,710
than many of you
can remember.

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,620
And my reign has
been extraordinary.

68
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,420
AGREE WITH ME!

69
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,022
Torch! Torch! Torch!

70
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,200
Who is that?

71
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,360
It's Dragon Lord Torch, dummy.

72
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,890
No, next to him.

73
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,290
That's his daughter,
Princess Ember.

74
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,500
I wouldn't even look
at her if I were you.

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,460
Unless you want
Torch to eat you.

76
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,220
This is fascinating! Dragons
are notoriously reckless,

77
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,470
but they do whatever
the Dragon Lord says.

78
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,680
Unfortunately,
according to dragon law,

79
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,080
it is time for me to
step down. Sad, I know.

80
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,140
BE SAD!

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,640
This is why I have
summoned you.

82
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,240
To compete for the throne
in the Gauntlet of Fire!

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,020
Whomever has the
strength and fortitude

84
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,820
to retrieve this
Bloodstone Scepter

85
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,160
from the heart of
the Flamecano

86
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,780
will be crowned Lord
of the Dragons!

87
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,760
When the scepter disappeared,
the dragons stopped glowing!

88
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,460
We are learning so much!

89
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,540
Ah ah ah ....

90
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
choo!

91
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,530
Uh, Excuse me.

92
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,930
Ugh. You even
sneeze like a pony.

93
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,860
The Gauntlet is dangerous,
for I designed it myself.

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,340
Only dragons with my ferocity,
strength and determination

95
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,660
will be able to finish.

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,200
We will gather at the cliff
when the sun is at its peak!

97
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,100
I don't want to be Dragon
Lord or dragon toast

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,100
and I stopped glowing so
let's sneak out of here!

99
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,560
Where do you think you're
going, little dragon?

100
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,240
Oh, uh, hi Your Lordship.
I was just going home.

101
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,820
You don't get to leave
unless I say you can.

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,510
Dad, look at him!
He's just a runt.

103
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,950
Besides, he doesn't even
want to compete. Let him go.

104
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,960
He is rather tiny. I could
squish him with my pinky claw.

105
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,860
That wasn't a joke;
it was a fact.

106
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,620
When I want you to laugh
I will say "BE AMUSED"!

107
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,000
Of course, Your Lordship.

108
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,440
I guess I don't understand
dragon customs.

109
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,500
Another reason why
I shouldn't compete.

110
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,600
Very well, little
dragon. I release you.

111
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,540
Thank you!

112
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,820
And thank you.

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,480
Where do you think you're going?

114
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,820
To prepare for the gauntlet.

115
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,100
No, you're not. You're not
much bigger than that runt

116
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,260
I just sent home.

117
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,960
But I'm smarter than most
of these boulderheads

118
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,030
and you know it.

119
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,280
Being smart won't help
you win this gauntlet.

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,940
It was designed for a
big strong dragon to win

121
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,360
because it takes a big
strong dragon to lead.

122
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,540
Besides, I SAID NO!

123
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,520
I hate when he does that!

124
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,400
When I become Dragon Lord,

125
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,140
I will make burps an
official greeting.

126
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
Ha, you? Please.

127
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,000
When I win, I will
pillage Equestria

128
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,240
for all their pillows!

129
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,320
Why should these
ponies be comfortable

130
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
while we sleep on rocks?

131
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,700
That's nothing.
When I'm in charge,

132
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,280
the first thing I'll do is get
revenge on those puny ponies!

133
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,040
They'll regret they
ever crossed Garble!

134
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,720
We'll take whatever
we want from Equestria

135
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,280
and burn the rest.

136
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,580
Oh my gosh. I can't
believe I'm saying this,

137
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,000
but I hope that
burping dragon wins.

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,400
None of them can win!

139
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,180
Equestria is in big trouble
if any of them are in charge!

140
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
But what
can we do?

141
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,900
There's only one thing to
do and only I can do it.

142
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,780
I have to win the
Gauntlet of Fire!

143
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,270
What do you mean you
have to win the Gauntlet?

144
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,480
It's the only way to protect
Equestria from the dragons!

145
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
You heard them. They have
horrible plans for ponies

146
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,940
if they win! So somehow,
I have to do it.

147
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,720
There has to be another way!

148
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,160
It's too dangerous.

149
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,000
Besides, if you win,
you'd have to stay here!

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,680
I know. But there's no other
way to keep my friends safe.

151
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,160
Well, if you're
staying to compete,

152
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,100
then we're staying
to cheer you on.

153
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,700
I thought I released
you, Tiny One.

154
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,910
I decided to compete. I
am a dragon, after all.

155
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,720
Are you sure? You
can't even fly!

156
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,140
All dragons are
welcome to compete,

157
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,750
for they do so at
their own peril.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,680
Flying to Flamecano Island is
the first of many challenges

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,300
you will face in your quest to
find the Bloodstone Scepter!

160
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,780
Good luck. Just kidding,
I hope you lose.

161
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,100
Aaaaah!

162
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,600
Thanks, Garble, I was
planning on swimming anyway!

163
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,540
You can do it, Spike!

164
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,820
He's gonna drown!

165
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,620
SPIKE!

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,040
Hey, are you OK?

167
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,300
Princess Ember!

168
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,150
What do you think you're doing?

169
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,600
Only saving your
ungrateful scales!

170
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,800
Did that seaweed just talk?

171
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,960
Ponies? What are
they doing here?

172
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
They're my friends!

173
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,000
Friends? Dragons
don't do friends.

174
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,820
Well, this dragon does!

175
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,880
Whatever. I don't care as long
as none of you get in my way.

176
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,640
I have a gauntlet to win.

177
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
But I thought your dad said...

178
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,880
I don't care what my dad said!

179
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,560
I'll show him and
everydragon who thinks

180
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm just a little "Princess"

181
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,480
there are better things
than being big and strong!

182
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,780
Aaah!

183
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,760
Don't leave me here, Spike!

184
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,910
Ha ha! I knew you'd do it.

185
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,360
Your pony friends made you soft.

186
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,120
Uh-huh. You're welcome.

187
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,850
For what? I didn't
say thank you.

188
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,220
Wow, you even smell like ponies.

189
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,360
Or is it coming from over there?

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,100
Uh, that's just me.

191
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,540
I uh, robbed some ponies
on my way over here.

192
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,540
I like your style.

193
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,820
Have I met you before?
You kinda look like--

194
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,120
My uh, old neighbor,
uh, Sandy Rockbeach!

195
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,760
Stupid slingtails
knocked me down.

196
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,220
But I've wasted enough time
making small talk. Get it?

197
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,900
Because you're too small
to win this. I'm funny.

198
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,520
Why did you cover for me?

199
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,540
You could have had
one less competitor.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,720
I could ask you the same thing.

201
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,560
You could have told
Garble about my friends.

202
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,460
Yikes. That looks rough.

203
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,860
But that's what
makes it a challenge.

204
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,580
Are you kidding? Those
boulders are huge!

205
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,660
Hey, what if we
work together?

206
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,380
You fly me up there and
I'll help you look out

207
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,380
for boulders like a
second set of eyes!

208
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,060
PSSST!

209
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,380
Spike!

210
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,860
Are you sure it's a good
idea to team up with Ember?

211
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,430
You don't know her too well.

212
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,720
I do know she could have
told Garble about you,

213
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,960
but she didn't. I
think we can trust her.

214
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,060
Her behavior does seem
contradictory to everything

215
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,500
I've noted about
dragons so far.

216
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,500
Hey! You. Little fella.

217
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,540
I've thought about it and your
plan makes sense. Let's do it.

218
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,940
Really? Great! It's a deal.

219
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,100
Just so you know, this doesn't
mean we're gonna pick flowers

220
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,740
or exchange necklaces or
whatever pony friends do.

221
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,160
Good luck. We'll
meet you at the top.

222
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,280
Pull up, there's
one on your tail!

223
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,060
Go left!

224
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,110
So, what do we do now?

225
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,540
I think we go through there.

226
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,080
Ah! Oh,
that looks scary!

227
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,560
I mean, you can do it!

228
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,930
Listen, Spike, I wouldn't have
made it this far without you.

229
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,620
So I guess, if you want to, we
could keep working together.

230
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,740
I mean, just until we
get through that tunnel.

231
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,860
OK.

232
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,300
We'll be right behind you.

233
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,280
Agh!

234
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,160
Oh, you made it!
Oh, we were so worried.

235
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,140
About us? Pssh. That
tunnel was cake.

236
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,120
Wait, how did you
two get through?

237
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,040
Rarity!

238
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,800
Oh thanks, Spike!

239
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,618
It was nothing.

240
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,220
Nothing? You just risked
everything to save her.

241
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,350
And they're putting themselves
in danger just to support you.

242
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,090
That's just what friends do.

243
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,420
Don't you have anyone
who looks out for you?

244
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,400
Not really. Unless
I count you...

245
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,220
...which I don't because we
were only helping each other

246
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,680
get through the tunnel and now
we're through the tunnel so,

247
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,780
that's it.

248
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,540
Wait. What do you mean?

249
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,040
Well, there's only one
winner, one scepter

250
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,540
and one Dragon Lord.

251
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,200
So I guess it's every
dragon for themselves.

252
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Oh. So we aren't
really friends?

253
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,220
Maybe if we were in ponyland

254
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,200
but like I said, dragons
don't do friendship.

255
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,170
I can't believe
Ember ditched me.

256
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,800
Oh you're better off. She was
only looking out for herself.

257
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,720
She's just like all
the other dragons.

258
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,680
She's not, though. I know it.

259
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,340
She saved me, even when
she didn't have to.

260
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
I don't care what she says.
That makes us friends.

261
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,140
Is it just me or
have we seen this crevice

262
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,280
three times already?

263
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,060
It's kind of hard to tell.
They all look the same.

264
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,700
Except for this one! Look!

265
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,580
We made it!

266
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,230
I can't believe I'm the only
dragon to make it this far.

267
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,600
<i>You're not!</i>

268
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,760
And I'm not losing to a puny
pony-loving dragon like you!

269
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,840
We have to
do something!

270
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,840
Look!

271
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,580
Ember! I thought it was
every dragon for themselves.

272
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,520
Why did you save me?

273
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,160
That's what friends do.
And I am. I mean we are.

274
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,190
I never should have
left you back there.

275
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,030
Ugh, please don't make me
talk about my feelings.

276
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,440
What the--?

277
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,860
Spike! Get the scepter!

278
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,780
Aaaaagh!

279
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,770
I'm sick and tired of you
two helping each other!

280
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,820
Dragons don't do helping!

281
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,840
These dragons do!

282
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,430
Whoa!

283
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,570
Leave her alone!

284
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,340
What? You? You have the scepter?

285
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,380
But that means that you're...

286
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,800
The Dragon Lord.
Dragon Lord Spike.

287
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,520
Aw. Dragon Lord Spike.

288
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,880
That's right. Uh,now go start
your long journey home.

289
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,130
And give every dragon
you see on the way a hug.

290
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,530
Don't tell them why.

291
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,660
Aw, but that'll be
super embarrassing!

292
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,440
I command you to do it!

293
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,300
Ugh. I can't believe this.

294
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,140
"Dragon Lord Spike". Hmm.
Has a nice ring to it.

295
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,780
Dragon Lord Ember
sounds a lot better.

296
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,340
What? No. You're
the Dragon Lord now.

297
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,740
The Dragon Lord is whoever
brings the scepter back

298
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,500
to your father.

299
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,740
Besides, you'll
make a great leader.

300
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,240
I was just doing this
to protect the ponies,

301
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,100
but I know you'll protect them
just as well as I would have.

302
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,690
Are you sure about this?

303
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,300
Absolutely. My home is in
Equestria with my friends.

304
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,460
Well, you'll have at least
one friend here, too.

305
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,340
What are you doing?

306
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
It's called a hug.

307
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,440
Oh. I don't know if
I like it, but OK.

308
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,480
Aw.

309
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,820
Ember? You?

310
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,160
I know you didn't think
I could do it, but I did.

311
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,220
I expressly told you NOT TO
DO IT! Because you're not--

312
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,600
--I'm not big and strong!
I know! But you know what?

313
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,460
I won anyway. So, maybe it
takes more than just being

314
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,720
big and strong to be
a good Dragon Lord.

315
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,250
I was wrong, Ember.

316
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,080
You might not be big, but
you are strong. And smart.

317
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,900
And perhaps that counts
for more than I thought.

318
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,660
And you will make
an excellent leader.

319
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,960
Thanks, Dad.

320
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,440
AGREE WITH HIM!

321
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,200
Just kidding. That's
not gonna be my thing.

322
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,710
Dragons, hear me!

323
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,900
I present to you our new
Dragon Lord... Ember!

324
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,240
What is the meaning of this?

325
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,460
I can't tell you!

326
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,320
You did well, Spike. With
Ember as Dragon Lord,

327
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,300
the ponies will be safe
and you've gained us

328
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
a powerful ally.

329
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,770
And a new friend.

330
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,540
Plus, Ember said I could
write to her any time

331
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,380
I had questions
about dragon culture!

332
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,580
With this much information,

333
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,920
I'll be able to write a
whole book on dragons!!

334
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,220
And I gained tons of
ideas for a new line

335
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,780
of camouflage clothing! I
think I'll call it camo-mod.
