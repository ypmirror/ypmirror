You're kidding, right?

214
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,204
Give up our Cutie Marks?

215
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,548
No way!

216
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,704
Fluttershy: Rainbow Dash,
don't be so rude!

217
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,512
I don't think we
should judge them.

218
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:33,352
They all seem perfectly
happy with their choice.

219
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:36,296
Don't believe their
smiles, Fluttershy.

220
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:40,236
I'm sorry, I guess we're just a
little confused by all of this.

221
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:43,288
We have no judgments
here in our village.

222
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,000
Each of us was
confused once as well,

223
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,668
blinded by the false
promise of our Cutie Marks.

224
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:50,832
Whoa whoa whoa!

225
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:52,520
Is she for real?

226
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,084
When we were sent
to this village,

227
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:58,760
we assumed it was to help
in some way, but...well,

228
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,032
it doesn't seem like
you need any help.

229
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:05,048
Have you considered perhaps that
you might have been sent here

230
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:07,396
so we could help you?

231
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:12,388
After all, nopony has
ever come to our village

232
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:13,500
and wanted to leave.

233
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,832
Why should you be any different?

234
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:19,180
But that is entirely
your choice.

235
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:22,944
Please, enjoy our little
corner of Equestria.

236
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,912
We're all quite fond of it.

237
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,124
No doubt you will be as well.

238
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:29,924
Double Diamond, please
help our guests

239
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:31,748
with whatever they
might need.

240
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,316
Of course.

241
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:40,916
Well, this will certainly
provide a boost

242
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:42,496
to our little community.

243
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,740
When the rest of Equestria sees

244
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,732
that a princess gave up
her Cutie Mark to join us,

245
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:52,612
they'll finally understand what
we're trying to accomplish.

246
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:57,180
Welcome!

247
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,084
A Cutie Mark is
a representation

248
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,096
of a pony's unique
talents and skills.

249
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,248
How is it possible to--

250
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,248
[gasp] What in the name
of Equestria is THAT?

251
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:10,264
Welcome!

252
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,568
Care to sample
some local fashion?

253
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:14,480
We've got cloaks this month!

254
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:15,804
[gag]

255
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:22,808
Perhaps another time,
good sir, thank you.

256
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,048
No wonder nopony's
wearing anything.

257
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:30,888
Really, girls, they may do
things a bit differently

258
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:33,796
than we're used to, but that's
no reason to be rude!

259
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,724
No, the reason to be rude

260
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,112
is that they all
keep staring at us.

261
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,796
Need something?

262
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,164
Uh, no, we're good.
Fluttershy's right.

263
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,620
If we're going to
get to the bottom

264
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:47,936
of why the map sent us here,

265
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,884
we'll need the
help of these ponies.

266
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,980
I think we ran off to
the end of Equestria

267
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:54,008
before we even knew
what that map was!

268
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:55,796
If we were at the
end of Equestria,

269
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:57,916
we'd be sitting on
a big A!

270
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,100
Hee Hee! Get it?

271
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:02,428
Oh please, Miss Pie, this is
hardly the time for jokes.

272
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:04,812
We've come all this
way and for what?

273
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:07,556
Maybe you're right,
but we're here now.

274
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,888
And it sure feels like
something's wrong.

275
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:12,348
That and two bits'll
get you a cup of cider.

276
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:13,732
Is this a bad time?

277
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:15,560
We shouldn't be
bickering like this

278
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:16,920
in front of our
new friends.

279
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,328
Really, Applejack, you're
almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!

280
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,068
Don't drag me
into this.

281
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:25,428
Is your friendship ending?

282
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:26,916
Are you crazy?

283
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,864
We'd never let a disagreement
get in the way of food!

284
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:33,108
OK, well. My
name is Sugar Belle.

285
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:34,724
What can I bring you?

286
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:35,676
We have...

287
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:36,528
muffins.

288
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,732
Then I guess we'll
take six muffins.

289
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:46,712
Make that twelve.

290
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,620
What? I'm hungry.

291
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:52,268
Come on, girls, we've
got to stick together.

292
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:55,544
It doesn't matter what happened
before; we're here now.

293
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:57,420
I guess you're right.

294
00:14:57,728 --> 00:15:00,772
And the sooner we figure out
why, the sooner we can go home.

295
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:03,668
Forgive me for
overhearing,

296
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:06,324
but just a moment ago
you were disagreeing.

297
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:09,124
And now it sounds
like you're agreeing.

298
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:10,544
Uh-huh.

299
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,252
Well, you had such
differing opinions.

300
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:14,572
And Cutie Marks.

301
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:17,740
We have differing opinions
all the time, darling.

302
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,412
But you look like
you're friends.

303
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:21,720
We are friends.

304
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,144
A simple disagreement
wouldn't change that.

305
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,528
I'm sorry, I'm just having
a hard time understanding.

306
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:30,956
Different talents lead
to different opinions,

307
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:33,040
which lead to
bitterness and misery.

308
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:35,936
So, why aren't you
bitter and--

309
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:36,612
Peh!

310
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:37,456
Blech!

311
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,016
Mmm...good!

312
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,416
It's all right, I know
I'm not a very good baker.

313
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:49,576
At least, I'm not any
better than anypony else

314
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:50,560
in the village.

315
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,612
Well, I hope you enjoy
our little village!

316
00:15:58,132 --> 00:15:59,264
Come inside before you go.

317
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,628
Meet me downstairs.

318
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:08,184
OK, that was weird, too.

319
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,704
Let's all sit here and eat
these muffins and act normal.

320
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:13,876
I think we're being watched.

321
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:18,660
Ya think?

322
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:20,200
No, not like that.

323
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:23,304
I mean somepony here doesn't
want us talking to Sugar Belle.

324
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:29,316
I got an idea.

325
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,516
But you gotta eat all
them muffins, Pinkie.

326
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,696
Me? Why me?

327
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,724
You got a stronger
stomach than any of us

328
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,976
and that filly in there
might be our best chance

329
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:40,408
at findin' out what in the
hay is goin' on around here.

330
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:57,080
Applejack: I can't believe you
ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie!

331
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:00,680
We'd best go inside
and get some more!

332
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,296
Nice work, Pinkie.

333
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:10,132
I've accidentally eaten
cardboard tastier than that.

334
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:12,800
Hello? Sugar Belle?

335
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,268
Sugar Belle: Thank
you for coming.

336
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:18,864
Why did want us
to come down here?

337
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,724
So nopony could see
what's about to happen.

Daydreaming is one
thing, but you mean...

00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,272
actually having
it put back on?

352
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,440

would like that.

She wants us all to be
happy in our sameness.

355
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,800
How do you take somepony's
Cutie Mark, anyway?

356
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:13,820
The Cutie Unmarking is
a beautiful experience.

357
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:16,316
Starlight uses the
Staff of Sameness

358
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,540
to magically take them away
and replace them with these.

359
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:23,716
But nopony should keep
you from your Cutie Mark.

360
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:26,552
It represents such an
essential part of who you are!

361
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:28,508
Oh, we're not kept from them.

362
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,668
They're in the vault,
up in the caves.

363
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:33,444
We can visit them any time
we like to remind us

364
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:36,275
of the heartache of a life
with special talents.

365
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:40,071
Can we visit this cave?

366
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,782
I'm delighted you're interested
in our Cutie Mark vault!

367
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:51,248
We hope someday every pony in
Equestria will make a pilgrimage

368
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:54,680
here to our little village
to have theirs removed, too,

369
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,040
And our message of ...[continues]

370
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,755
This must be the
reason we're here.

371
00:18:58,115 --> 00:18:59,457
Pilgrimaging?

372
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,751
No, helping those ponies
get their Cutie Marks back.

373
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,897
Oh. Are you sure, Twilight?

374
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,235
Maybe they missed
them a little,

375
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,840
but even they didn't
seem all that unhappy.

376
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,982
Then why did they want
to meet us in secret?

377
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:13,142
And why did they ask us
not to tell Starlight

378
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,631
who told us about the vault?

379
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,573
Something's not right.

380
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:18,342
Just through here!

381
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:23,351
Behold!

382
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:28,897
Our Cutie Mark vault.

383
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:35,360
Twilight: I've never seen
anything like it!

384
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:39,528
And here is the
Staff of Sameness.

385
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,168
It was one of the great
mage Meadowbrook's

386
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,977
nine enchanted items.

387
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:47,075
We are incredibly
fortunate to have it here.

388
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:50,586
This is the tool that allows
us to free ourselves

389
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:52,026
from our Marks.

390
00:19:52,906 --> 00:19:57,244
I'm curious; how did the
subject of the vault come up?

391
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,231
Oh, some ponies
were telling us

392
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:00,866
how much they missed
their Cutie Marks and--

393
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:01,595
Pinkie!

394
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:02,484
Oops.

395
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:05,026
Starlight: Were they!

396
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:09,257

all sorts of free thinking,

Good.

of that, shall we?
