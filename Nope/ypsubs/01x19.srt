1
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:11,366
Perfect!

2
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,270
Coming!

3
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:15,880
Welcome to Carousel Boutique...

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,230
...where every garment is
chic, unique and magnifique.

5
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:24,222
Sapphire Shores! The Pony of Pop!

6
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:27,433
Good afternoon, Miss Raritee!

7
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:30,531
You... you know my name?

8
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,047
Well, of course I do, darling.

9
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:35,101
I make it a point to know all
of the up-and-coming designers...

10
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,930
...and Clothes Horse magazine
simply raved about you.

11
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,245
Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up.

12
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,659
How may I help you, Miss Shores?

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,457
Oh please, call me Sapphire.

14
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,867
How may I help you, Sapphire?

15
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:56,544
Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring
all of Equestria with my latest concert...

16
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:59,617
SAPPHIRE SHORES ZIGFILLY FOLLIES!

17
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:01,550
...so I need to look...

18
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:04,260
SEEENSATIONAL!

19
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,105
OW!

20
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:06,885
I have just what you need.

21
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:12,143
Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the
pièce de résistance de la haute couture.

22
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:18,306
I used every last diamond
I found on this one garment.

23
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:21,817
And it is spectacular!

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,776
I'll take it.

25
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:23,922
Really?

26
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:27,750
Oh yes, and five more,
each done up in a different jewel.

27
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:29,779
Beg pardon?

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,108
Costume changes.

29
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,081
Yes, I do have that effect on ponies.

30
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,527
Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! The Pony of Pop!

31
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:21,767
She is awesome!

32
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,127
I mean, she's gorgeous, talented and...

33
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:27,496
...and not even half the pony you are.

34
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:30,765
I mean, you're ten times more
gorgeous and talented and...

35
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:33,621
Spike, a lady is never jealous.

36
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:37,113
Of course not. But were you
totally flipping out or what?

37
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:39,712
Ladies do not "flip out", Spike.

38
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:42,374
However, I was quite in awe.

39
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:47,267
Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever
before to decorate her costumes.

40
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,182
Oh, aha!

41
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:52,134
Did you find some?

42
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,647
Yes, Spike! Right there!

43
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:07,428
You look so delicious...

44
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:10,370
Spike!

45
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:13,414
I promised I'll give you gems to snack on.

46
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:17,690
But we need to collect more first or I'll never
be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.

47
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:22,208
I will miss you, my sweets.

48
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:25,429
Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.

49
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,011
At your service, my lady.

50
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:41,797
Spike!

51
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,746
You've been very patient today, Spike.

52
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:08,465
And for that you'll get the finest reward.

53
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:11,130
This is from me to you.

54
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,308
Is something wrong, Spike?

55
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,918
No. It's perfect.

56
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:25,941
Ooh, bring the cart, Spike.
There are more over here.

57
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:27,222
For me.

58
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,483
From Rarity.

59
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:35,422
Yesss, gemsss. Gemsss!

60
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:38,187
Our preciousss gemsss!

61
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:40,072
He is the gem hunter.

62
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:43,172
With him we can have all those gems.

63
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,890
And more!

64
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:48,729
Let's get the dragon.

65
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,490
Spike! Where are you?

66
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,705
What? Who is that?

67
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,030
You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.

68
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,404
Coming!

69
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:02,479
I think we're really going
to strike gold this time.

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,391
So to speak.

71
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,902
Jackpot!

72
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:10,688
Oh, it's not the dragon we want. It's the pony!

73
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:13,422
The pony...

74
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,717
Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today.

75
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:18,812
And these will certainly get me well
on my way with Sapphire's outfits.

76
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,922
Why don't we start headi... Oh!

77
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:22,829
What's this? Another jewel!

78
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,841
Oh, strange. It's in the trees.

79
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,566
Good day, gentle... uh, fellow.

80
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:35,372
I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.

81
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:37,420
And you are...?

82
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:40,572
A diamond dog.

83
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,128
Oh really? Oh well, that explains
your fine taste in jewelry.

84
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:47,171
I mean I-I-I know that diamonds
are a girl's best friend...

85
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:50,434
...and now I know that they're a
dog's best friend too, ha ha ha.

86
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:53,345
So, um... you're out hunting for gems as well?

87
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,810
Yes. We hunt.

88
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:57,104
Uh... we?

89
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:58,883
We hunt for gems.

90
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:02,705
But you are a better hunter. So now we hunt...

91
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:04,191
...for you!

92
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,579
Run, Rarity! Run!

93
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,925
Spike! Come on! Hurry!

94
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:24,666
Gotcha!

95
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,397
Got him, Rarity! I got him!

96
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:31,396
Ha ha! Nope!

97
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:34,559
Sorry, scaly one.

98
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:36,135
Wait! Rarity?

99
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:41,178
Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop!
Put me down, you scum! You rough...!

100
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:42,853
Rarity!

101
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,137
Spike!

102
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,592
Ah, dirt!

103
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:47,505
AAAAAH, SPIKE!

104
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,703
Which... what... where...

105
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,883
SAVE ME...!

106
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:55,091
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

107
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,876
Spike, can you breathe now?

108
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:04,483
Yes... I think so.

109
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:06,592
Good. Now tell us what you know.

110
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,673
Yeah. Cause all you said earlier was...

111
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,957
Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs...
hole... taken... SAVE HER!

112
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,664
Not a whole lot to go on there, Sport.

113
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:20,674
Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking
for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.

114
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:21,839
Creepy guys?

115
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:23,740
They called themselves the diamond dogs.

116
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,549
They grabbed Rarity and disappeared
down a hole in the ground.

117
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:30,802
Well, that sounds mighty easy. Just take us
to that their hole and we'll save Rarity.

118
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:37,475
Holy Moly, that's a lotta holeys.

119
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:39,704
Come on, girls! Let's get started.

120
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,329
Hello!

121
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,075
Quick! We gotta get down one
before they're all filled up.

122
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,488
Oh! Oh my. Oh! Oh!

123
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,155
We can't muscle through it!

124
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,040
We'll see about that.

125
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,393
Huh. Heavens to Betsy.

126
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,803
Now I'm used to pickin' myself up
and dustin' myself off...

127
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,626
...but Rarity won't even touch
mud 'less it's imported.

128
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,224
Oh, Rarity...

129
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,476
Oh, woe is me! What ever shall I do?

130
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,546
Ah! Dirt, dirt!

131
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:54,019
Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop! Make it stop!

132
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,347
Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt.

133
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:58,268
It stings, it burns.

134
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:02,553
Help! Oh, somepony save me, SAVE ME!

135
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:05,228
We gotta save her.

136
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:07,196
But they blocked up all the holes.

137
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:10,650
Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!

138
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:28,346
Get 'em!

139
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:45,765
Come on!

140
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:00,442
Oh, those scary monsters popping up everywhere.

141
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:03,277
-Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified.
-Oh...

142
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,465
Get me the baubles!

143
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:08,873
Get me the beads!

144
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:10,435
Get me the trinkets!

145
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,395
Where is the treasure?!

146
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:17,059
Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?

147
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,030
I got it!

148
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,088
I'll save you, my sweet!

149
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:24,271
Huh?

150
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:32,085
-Spike, it is very noble of you...
-Shhh!

151
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,873
...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.

152
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,606
Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress.

153
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:40,586
I shall save you.

154
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:43,653
Show yourselves, dogs! You curs!

155
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:47,925
Hah. There you are, you mingy mutts.

156
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,708
Who are you calling mutts?

157
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:51,899
Unleash the hounds!

158
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:31,172
Now, where is Lady Rarity?

159
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:41,015
Spike! I knew you would save me!

160
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:43,849
Nothing could stop me, my lady.

161
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:47,669
Oh, Spike. You are my hero.

162
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:56,664
Hoho there, lover boy.

163
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:58,968
Whoa!

164
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,559
Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa...

165
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,609
I got a bite! I got a bite!

166
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,417
Hold on there, little fella.

167
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:06,017
Applejack!

168
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,149
Twilight!

169
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,379
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...

170
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,439
Wait for me! Wheee!

171
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,226
Whee!

172
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:35,298
Ha ha, it worked! We're in!
Now we can finally save Rarity!

173
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:36,754
Um...

174
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:38,667
Which way do we go?

175
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:45,145
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

176
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:50,161
All these tunnels...
How are we ever gonna find Rarity?

177
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:53,056
Guess we're just gonna have to
start going down them one by one.

178
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:56,439
That could take forever!
There's gotta be way to narrow it down.

179
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,181
I know!

180
00:12:57,182 --> 00:13:00,177
I bet they've taken Rarity
down the tunnel with the most gems.

181
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:03,964
But Spike, Rarity is the only one
who knows how to find gems.

182
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:08,345
No, Twilight. You can!
You can copy Rarity's gemfinding spell.

183
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:10,262
Oh my gosh! You're right!

184
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:14,631
Rarity showed me how she did it
a while back. If I can just remember...

185
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,787
That's it.

186
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:23,814
You did it, Twilight. Come on!

187
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,324
We're coming, Rarity.
We'll save you. Just hold on!

188
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:32,083
Oh please, diamond dogs. Please let me go.

189
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:32,971
No!

190
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:35,190
You're our precious little pony.

191
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,591
For ever!

192
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,088
But what ever do you want from me?

193
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,597
Gemsss!

194
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:44,481
Yes! The gems. The jewels.

195
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,585
Find them! Find them all!

196
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,121
Oh! Is that all?

197
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:58,691
There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there.
Now, would you be so kind as to show me the exit?

198
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,265
Good!

199
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:04,371
Now, dig them up, pony.

200
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,252
What? But you said you wanted
me to *find* the gems.

201
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:11,036
Yes! Find and then dig.

202
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:11,891
Dig?

203
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,999
Yes. Dig.

204
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,703
What are you doing? We said dig!

205
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:35,401
Forgive me but prior to you so rudely
dragging me into your dirt pit...

206
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:40,240
...I had a pony pedi and I am not about to chip
a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.

207
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,847
Oh, for goodness.

208
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,696
Fine! Just stop. Stop!

209
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:52,340
Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast.

210
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,328
She won't dig, she pulls.

211
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,009
I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?

212
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:05,450
Others will dig. You will haul the wagon.

213
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:08,931
Prrrecious pony pedi will be preserved.

214
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,770
Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care.

215
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:13,932
When was the last time you two had a manicure?

216
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,985
You're scratching up my coat
with that jagged things.

217
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:18,404
Please be quiet!

218
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:21,581
Good heavens, what is that smell?

219
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:24,680
Smeeeeeell?

220
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,906
Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.

221
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:33,348
Enough!

222
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:34,944
Search, pony!

223
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:37,387
Well, since you *insist*...

224
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,848
But I must say the working conditions
in here are simply dreadful.

225
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:44,506
Musty and damp, it's going to
wreak havoc on my mane.

226
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,589
And this air is strictly suffocating.

227
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:50,609
And when I try to get a deep breath,
the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseating.

228
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:56,717
You look and smell like if you haven't bathed
in weeks. Have you never heard of soap?

229
00:15:57,647 --> 00:15:59,627
You could all do with a good
round of soap and water.

230
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:03,081
Water, water, I'm terribly thirsty.
Could I please have some water?

231
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:06,512
Good gracious, I can't take this anymore.

232
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,177
BE QUIET, PONY!

233
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:12,331
And that's another thing. I would appreciate
if you stopped calling me "pony".

234
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:15,371
I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such.

235
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:19,006
So you may call me "Miss" or
"Rarity" or "Miss Rarity"

236
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:23,369
Enough! Your whining! I-I-It hurts!

237
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,968
Whining? I am *not* whining. I am complaining.

238
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,613
Do you want to hear whining?

239
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,399
Thiiis iiis whiiining!

240
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,925
Oooh, this harness it too tiiight!

241
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,465
It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it?

242
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:38,966
Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty!

243
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:42,298
Why didn't you clean it first?
It's gonna leave a staaain!

244
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:46,101
And the wagon's getting heeeavy,
why do I have to pull it?!

245
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:47,706
Aaah! Make it stop!

246
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,436
Stop whining!

247
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:53,333
But I thought you wanted whiiining!

248
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,808
We'll do anything, pony!

249
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:02,039
Oh, uh, we'll do anything, "Miss Rarity".

250
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:04,638
Anything?

251
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:16,090
This water is hardly sparkling.
But I suppose it will have to do.

252
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:24,115
Wait! Why are we doing this?

253
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:29,078
To stop the awful noises from
the pony's mouth, remember?

254
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:33,137
Yes, yes, I know.

255
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:36,463
This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around.

256
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:38,745
What are we? Mice or dogs?

257
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:40,871
Mi... dogs?

258
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,810
Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull.

259
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,967
Let her make the awful noises.

260
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:49,785
Huh? What are you doing?

261
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:51,355
Hey, you spilled my drink.

262
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:55,430
Not sooo tiiight!

263
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,872
Ha! Make the noises all you want.

264
00:17:57,873 --> 00:17:59,476
But move while you make them.

265
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:00,735
Hyah, mule!

266
00:18:01,837 --> 00:18:05,802
Did you just call me a... mule?

267
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:13,295
Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I too am ugly?

268
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,936
What are *these* noises?

269
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:22,004
HE CALLED ME UGLY!

270
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,724
No! Mule! I said mule!

271
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:28,406
An old ugly mule! And it's true!

272
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:34,213
Just look at me. I used to be beautiful,
but... but... nooow...

273
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,190
No, no! You're still beautiful, po... uh, Miss Rarity.

274
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:41,192
You're just saying that!

275
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:43,533
No, you're still pretty and... and...

276
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,531
Oh, uh uh, nice. Yeah.

277
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:50,554
I don't believe you! You never liked me!

278
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:56,913
I have just about enough of this.

279
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:04,517
We're getting close. I can feel it.

280
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,519
It's coming from down here! Come on!

281
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:15,023
She must be in there. Let's go!

282
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,995
More workhorses.

283
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:22,953
Ho, doggies. If you can take
this bull by the horns...

284
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,963
...you better be ready for a ride.

285
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,395
Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out.

286
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:29,973
Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.

287
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,905
Yeehaw!

288
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:40,889
Get along, little doggies!

289
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:49,821
I'm coming for you, my lady.

290
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,505
Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!

291
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:55,367
And just what do you think you're doing?

292
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,758
Please, Twilight. Just give me this.

293
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,428
Fine.

294
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,814
Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!

295
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:11,517
Excuse me?

296
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:13,637
-So picky.
-And critical.

297
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:15,885
-She won't stop talking.
-And crying.

298
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:18,540
We, uh, give her back. Yes.

299
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:21,068
Rarity! You're safe!

300
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:23,486
Why, yes. Hello, girls.

301
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:25,742
You are just in time to assist me.

302
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:27,543
Assist you with what?

303
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,095
With those.

304
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:36,661
You're letting us leave with all these... jewels?

305
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,533
Yes. Take them. And her with them.

306
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:42,000
Please!

307
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:49,572
I can't believe you got all these gems!

308
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:52,887
Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.

309
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:57,447
Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean
I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation.

310
00:20:57,448 --> 00:21:00,491
I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.

311
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:04,391
I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia
to tell her what you taught me today.

312
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,691
Me? What did I teach you?

313
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:10,105
Just because somepony is ladylike
doesn't make her weak.

314
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:11,967
In fact, by using her wits...

315
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:16,615
...a seemingly defenseless pony can be
the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.

316
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:18,757
"Outshines" is right.

317
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:22,462
Now you have enough gems
to cover Sapphire Shores's costumes.

318
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:25,044
Not if you eat them all, Spike.

319
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,170
