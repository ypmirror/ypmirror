1
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:08,572
Look at that, Tank!

2
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:11,364
Cloudsdale's here!

3
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:14,193
That means Ponyville
is next up for winter!

4
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:26,471
You're doing awesome,
everypony! Keep it up!

5
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:29,023
We need those leaves
off those trees!

6
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:35,604
Once we get autumn cleared
away, it'll be "Hello, Winter!"

7
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:42,290
Was that a yawn
I just saw?

8
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:47,136
How can you be tired when the
most exciting time of the year

9
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:48,618
is right around the corner!

10
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:51,237
And don't forget
the best part...

11
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:53,726
our first winter together!

12
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,507
Come on, wake up!

13
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:01,734
Once those ponies bring in
the big fat clouds

14
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:04,277
full of snowflakes, we'll
have a ton of snow

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,244
for our extreme sledding!

16
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:10,176
Ha ha ha!

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,738
Whoa!

18
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:12,846
Whoo hoo!

19
00:01:15,414 --> 00:01:17,351
And over there we can
play horse hockey!

20
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:19,242
With no shoulder or rump pads!

21
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:30,947
Everything's looking
great, don't you think?

22
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:34,640
Almost everything. Does
Tank look all right to you?

23
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,848
Well, he does seem to be
moving a little slowly.

24
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:41,343
I know, right?

25
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,000
And he looks kind
of sleepy...

26
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:45,941
Totally!

27
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:47,633
just like he always does.

28
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:50,614
Yeah, heh-heh, I'm
sure you're right.

29
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:07,550
Regular Subtitles by YayPonies
We have Muffins
http://main.yayponies.eu

30
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:41,477
Well?

31
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:45,827
I suppose his heartbeat
COULD be a teensy, weensy,

32
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:48,362
eensy bit slower than usual.

33
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,149
OK, so give him a
vitamin or something.

34
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:57,141
I don't think he
needs that.

35
00:02:57,448 --> 00:02:58,976
Maybe we're just
staying up too late.

36
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:00,993
Too many Derring-Do stories.

37
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,591
That's not it either.

38
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:06,307
Well, what's wrong
with him then?

39
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:09,052
Nothing. He's
perfectly fine!

40
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:12,778
He's just going
to hibernate.

41
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:16,248
You do realize he's
not a bear, right?

42
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:20,311
When the weather grows cold
and less food is available,

43
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:23,233
many animals hibernate
to conserve energy.

44
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:28,821
It's like taking a really
long nap during winter.

45
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:31,343
And then they wake
up in spring!

46
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:34,189
And see? Even
tortoises do it.

47
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:38,349
When the time comes, Tank will
leave and dig into the ground.

48
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:44,395
But don't worry, he'll
reappear when the spring sun

49
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,336
warms the ground back up.

50
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:49,296
Come on! Tortoises
don't hibernate.

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,709
Somepony put that picture
in there as a joke.

52
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,953
It's not a joke.

53
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,915
Well then your
book must be wrong.

54
00:03:57,642 --> 00:04:01,035
Rainbow Dash, Tank
needs to hibernate.

55
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:04,690
It's healthy for him, just like
sleeping is healthy for us.

56
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:08,766
Whatever, OK, thanks.
Come on, Tank.

57
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:14,054
Where are you going?

58
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:18,484
To get a second opinion from
a REAL reptile expert.

59
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,612
I told you, Rainbow
Dash. I'm a DRAGON!

60
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:27,296
Come on, you're
practically twins!

61
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,589
I'm purple!

62
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,004
But if you don't have to
hibernate, why should Tank?

63
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:37,288
Because he's a TORTOISE.
And I'm a DRAGON.

64
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,229
Same family though, right?

65
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,480
No!

66
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:42,122
I'll take that as a yes.

67
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:45,823
Look, if Fluttershy says
tortoises hibernate,

68
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:47,646
then I guarantee
tortoises hiber--

69
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,016
Well, what would you know?
You're a dragon!

70
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:55,654
Nopony knows you like
I do, Tank.

71
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,682
All you need is some hard work
to get the ol' blood pumping.

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,206
Come on!

73
00:05:12,858 --> 00:05:15,743
These things are heavy!
Chock full o' snowflakes.

74
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:18,463
We're gonna have such a
killer time in the snow, Tank!

75
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:24,522
Tank? TANK?

76
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:28,261
Aw, look at that
cute wittle Tanky!

77
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:32,324
All snuggly wuggly,
getting ready to hibern---

78
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:34,332
DON'T SAY THAT WORD!

79
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,709
Which one? Snuggly?
Wuggly? Tanky? Hiberna--

80
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,370
THAT ONE!

81
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,858
I was just saying
how cute he loo--

82
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,829
If you think hiber-- you know,
that napping thing--

83
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:47,886
is SOOO cute, why
don't you go do it?

84
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,835
Somewhere far away from here!

85
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,160
What are you looking at?

86
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:59,237
Pinkie Pie and I are just
having a conversation!

87
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:02,635
Look Rainbow Dash, we all
know how upset you are

88
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,343
about Tank hiber--

89
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:05,760
SHHHH! Don't say that word!

90
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,145
That's what started this all!

91
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,498
We know how upset
you are about Tank,

92
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:12,071
but you shouldn't take your
anger out on your friends.

93
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,008
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ANGER?

94
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,768
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT ANGER!

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,896
I'M NOT UPSET!

96
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:18,665
AND I AM NOT ANGRY!

97
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:20,067
DO I LOOK ANGRY?

98
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:25,073
C'MON TANK, LET'S
GET OUTTA HERE!

99
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:31,591
I need you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed,

100
00:06:31,882 --> 00:06:33,987
not sleepy-eyed
and scaly-tailed...

101
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,644
...which is
exactly what you are.

102
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:38,416
But get up anyway!

103
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:45,898
You CAN'T hiber--you know!

104
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:47,818
What about all the primo things

105
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:49,397
we're gonna do
together this winter?

106
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,496
Building snowponies,
starting snowball fights,

107
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:55,010
sipping hot cider by the fire.

108
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:00,210
DON'T YOU WANT TO DO
THOSE THINGS WITH ME?

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,888
Think, Rainbow Dash, think!

110
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:09,995
Tank's only hibernating
because it's cold, right?

111
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,749
Well, I'd rather have
him awake in the heat

112
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,850
than asleep in the cold.

113
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:23,002
I'll just have to STOP WINTER!

114
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,907
So, where do
these clouds go?

115
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:33,532
Over by Clear Skies.

116
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,132
But there's Clear
Skies everywhere.

117
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,035
Yo! Clear Skies
right here!

118
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,094
But there's Clear
Skies over there, too.

119
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,724
That's Open Skies.

120
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,292
There's open
skies everywhere!

121
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:45,448
I'm not everywhere;
I'm right here.

122
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,926
Wait, so, you're Open Skies,
and you're Clear Skies...

123
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:50,096
then what's all that?

124
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:51,949
Open, Clear Skies!

125
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:55,271
Hey! Where'd our
fluffy clouds go?

126
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,364
Fluffy Clouds?
He's over there!

127
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:02,833
Ha! Stopping winter is
gonna be a breeze!

Here comes the next shipment!
Move those clouds over!

162
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:08,934
For every hoofstep back, they
go three hoofsteps forward!

163
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:10,661
What am I gonna do?

164
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,880
Cloudsdale...THAT'S IT, TANK!

165
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:28,930
If I can't stop
winter in Ponyville,

166
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:31,317
maybe I can stop
it at the source!

167
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:01,587
Lunch hour! Perfect!

168
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:43,187
The winter lab!
We're in, Tank!

169
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:45,970
Now, we just gotta figure
out a way to shut it down!

170
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:49,044
Sabotage snowflakes?

171
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:51,414
I think we gotta go
bigger than that.

172
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:54,429
Wait here.

173
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,006
Hmm. We could get
rid of these clouds,

174
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:11,120
but that's still
not big enough.

175
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:20,416
Slam dunk! With no water, they
can't make clouds or snow!

176
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:22,690
They can't make WINTER!

177
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:28,475
I hate to do this to
those weather ponies,

178
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,221
but desperate times call
for desperate measures!

179
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:35,886
Oopsie! Looks like these
were a little loose!

180
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:42,433
And there goes
winter...down the drain!

181
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,012
Whoa! I can't see!

182
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:09,709
Oof!

183
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,797
Let's get outta here!

184
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:56,871
What in the name of
Celestia's goin' on up there?

185
00:14:57,869 --> 00:14:59,671
Prepare yourselves, everypony...

186
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:01,978
Winter is coming.

187
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,296
EVERYPONY! LOOK OUT!

188
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,492
You OK, Tank?

189
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,505
Rainbow Dash! Are
you all right?

190
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:54,774
No.

191
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,835
Knock, knock!

192
00:16:12,593 --> 00:16:14,661
How are you feeling,
Rainbow Dash?

193
00:16:15,498 --> 00:16:16,846
Whatever.

194
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:19,616
The poor thing
looks so sad!

195
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,642
Just what are we
going to do?

196
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:23,397
I don't know
what we CAN do.

197
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:27,574
Buck up, sugarcube, you just
ain't yourself these days.

198
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,637
Whatever.

199
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:33,018
Oh, how can I say
this tactfully?

200
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:34,875
You've lost your
sparkle, Rainbow Dash!

201
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:41,301
I hate to say this...but well...
you've become...a party pooper!

202
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:45,781
Didn't you hear me?
I said whatever.

203
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:49,157
I don't know if you're here
to cheer me up or what,

204
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:51,002
but I'm fine.

205
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:52,976
Let me handle this.

206
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:58,126
Rainbow Dash, your winter
is going to be PETLESS!

207
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,821
Whatever did you
do that for?

208
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:18,547
Because she'll never get past
this until she lets it all out.

209
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:34,282
Uh, it's OK! Tank'll come
back in a few months!

210
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:43,507
MONTHS? [wailing]
I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO!

211
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,800
All right, all right.
There there.

212
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:50,778
Nice goin', Fluttershy.
How do we get her to stop?

213
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,564
She's got to be about done now.
Can't be too much left in there.

214
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,174
Feeling better?

215
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:05,600
Uh-huh.

216
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:14,631
Oh, you poor,
poor thing!

217
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,644
I can't bear to see
Fluttershy cry!

218
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,498
It's...just...heart-wrenching!

219
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,409
You, too?

220
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:32,804
Nope. I'm good.

221
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:37,128
Look, everypony, I know how
hard it is to say goodbye--

222
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm mostly sad because
you're NOT sad!

223
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:44,496
What? Me? What
about Applejack?

224
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:47,671
Applejack cries on
the inside, Twilight!

225
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:48,896
It's true.

226
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:52,454
It's all right, Fluttershy.
It's all right.

227
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,762
You think she's done or
just gettin' a third wind?

228
00:18:56,989 --> 00:19:01,221
I don't know. Rainbow
Dash? Are you OK?

229
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:06,644
I think so.

230
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:10,189
I feel better.
Really, I do.

231
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,134
Thanks, everypony. I don't
know what I'd do without you.

232
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,473
Or him...

233
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,425
Oh, Tank. I'm sure
gonna miss you.

234
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:46,560
Well, guess we're starting
winter with a bang.

235
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:49,578
The fun's come early! Yee-haw!

236
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,909
You think we could mess
up winter every year?

237
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:54,829
It's way less work!

238
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:57,995
Uh, I don't think Rainbow
Dash could handle it.

239
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:00,661
Riding that entire
season from Cloudsdale

240
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:03,242
to Ponyville WAS
pretty awesome.

241
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:09,178
I thought you guys might
like to say goodbye to Tank.

242
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:10,934
He's ready to hibernate.

243
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:15,275
You're using the word!
She's using the word!

244
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:17,486
And when Tank
finishes hibernating,

245
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:20,509
I'm going to throw him the
biggest Welcome Home party ever!

246
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:23,423
Or wait. Should it be a
"Welcome Above Ground" party?

247
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,208
Or a "Happy Wake-Up" party?

248
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:27,772
Maybe an "It's
about time" party?

249
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:30,252
And I'll design him a
very special suit

250
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,322
just for the occasion,

251
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:32,960
whichever one it
ends up being!

252
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,621
I'm glad you're feelin' a
little better, Rainbow Dash.

253
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:37,625
Yeah. Me too.

254
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:51,642
So, you really want to do
this hibernating thing, huh?

255
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:54,976
Goodbye Tank!

256
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,715
Have a good
sleep, Tank!
See you later,
little fella!

257
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:58,972
Goodbye Tank,
we'll miss you!

258
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,909
Well? Ready for
some winter fun?

259
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,618
Uh, I'm gonna hang here
and read to him a bit.

260
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:20,282
That little guy can never get to
sleep without a bedtime story.

261
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,221
I'll be right there.
