1
00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:04,035
Today is the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders!

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:05,819
I can just feel it!

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,126
Today is the day we are all gonna
get our cutie marks in...

4
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:12,050
...bowlin'!

5
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,017
Woohoo!

6
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:18,776
I mean... Yaaay!

7
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:23,095
Why, after today we won't even be
the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore.

8
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:24,103
We'll be the...

9
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:25,850
...the Three Strikes!

10
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:28,529
That makes us sound
like we've struck out.

11
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:32,824
How about... the Pin Twins!

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,590
But there are three of us.

13
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:39,227
Okay then. Um...

14
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:41,336
The Bowling Dolls!

15
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,215
The Bowling Dolls! That's it!

16
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:46,240
Perfect!

17
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:49,686
Alrighty then. Let's bowl 'em over!

18
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:35,046
Cool! A bowling cutie mark!

19
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:37,614
I did it! I did it!

20
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,499
Blank?

21
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:46,473
But... But...

22
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,809
But what about my ball?

23
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:39,413
That bowling sure was fun.

24
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:41,516
Even if all I got was gutterballs.

25
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:44,992
Yeah. At least you're able to
keep your ball in your lane.

26
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:48,412
I don't think Mr. Kingpin is ever
gonna let me play again.

27
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:54,107
Hey! Maybe I could get
my cutie mark in demolition?

28
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:01,873
Aw, come on, Apple Bloom.

29
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:05,187
I know just what you need to
put the bloom back on your apple.

30
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,305
A treat from Sugarcube Corner
will cheer you up!

31
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:13,493
No, it won't.

32
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,567
A party will cheer you up!

33
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:20,592
No, it won't.

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,930
A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.

35
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:28,351
No, it won't!

36
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:32,382
Come on, Apple Bloom!
It's just a cutie mark.

37
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:34,485
Or lack of a cutie mark!

38
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:36,221
Shh! That's not helping.

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,606
Apple Bloom! Where are you going?

40
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,617
Apple Bloom! Come back!

41
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,008
Whoa!

42
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,131
Well. Who is it that we have here?

43
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:02,838
Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear.

44
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,463
Aw!

45
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,597
What has happened to you, youth?

46
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:11,911
Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth.

47
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:14,846
Come with me. I have just the trick...

48
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:17,044
...that will fix you up quite quick.

49
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:23,256
I tried everything, Thecora.
And thtill no cutie mark.

50
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:27,664
Why, I'm gonna be as old as Granny
Thmith and thtill have a blank flank.

51
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:30,461
Your frustration is well understood.

52
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:33,620
But one must be patient
for all things good.

53
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,467
I've heard that from everypony I know.

54
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:40,627
And now from every Thebra I know.

55
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,469
I'm jutht too impathient
to be pathient.

56
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:47,218
I jutht want my cutie mark
and I want it now!

57
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:55,901
For your cutie mark
you will have to wait.

58
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:58,541
We must fix that tooth
before it's too late!

59
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,747
Now drink down every little drop...

60
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:07,466
...and this mixture will
mend that chip on top.

61
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,415
Oh my star apples! You did it, Zecora!

62
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:25,617
Golly.

63
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,464
You have tonics that heal
all sorts of ailments.

64
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:31,615
Bad bones, bad back, bad breath...

65
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:33,798
Yes, little one. It is true.

66
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,588
I have many a healing brew.

67
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:38,118
And not only stuff that fixes the bad...

68
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,264
...but stuff that brings the good.

69
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:43,722
Good health, good hair... good heavens!

70
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:46,404
Hmm...

71
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:51,051
I bet you can mix up
a brew to fix... anything.

72
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,606
There are many mixtures in this room...

73
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,407
...but none for what you
want, dear Apple Bloom.

74
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:01,516
A magic potion does not hold the key...

75
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:06,123
...for a cutie mark.
Time is the only remedy.

76
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:07,445
Fine.

77
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:15,860
What's you got goin' on there?

78
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,917
I am brewing up another mix
for a rooster and his chicks.

79
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:22,235
It seems the rooster
has lost his crow...

80
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,719
...making mornings very slow.

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,578
Hey! I've seen that flower
bloomin' in Ponyville. What is it?

82
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:31,335
It is one we call "heart's desire".

83
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:34,531
A dash will ignite the rooster's fire.

84
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:39,991
With heart's desire his
talent comes into view...

85
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:43,020
...and he'll make a mighty
cock-a-doodle-doo!

86
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,628
Zowie!

87
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,705
Heart's desire, huh?

88
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:52,214
Ay me! But what is this?

89
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:54,094
I've run out of amethyst.

90
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:58,020
I must go get this purple flower
for my brew to have full power.

91
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:01,335
Yeah. You go. You go.

92
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,419
I'm so hungry.

93
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,181
Yeah. I can't wait...

94
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:19,383
Apple Bloom! You've got
your cutie mark!

95
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:30,793
Um... Apple Bloom. What is it?

96
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:35,006
Yeah. Is it an "O"?
Is your talent spelling?

97
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:37,988
Or is it a ring? Are you
a jewelery maker?

98
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:41,982
Or ith it a powdered donut?
Cauthe that thouhdth delithoiuth.

99
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,909
No. It's a loop-de-hoop!

100
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:49,634
A what now?

101
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,043
A loop-de-hoop. 'least that's
what I always called it.

102
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:56,518
Applejack made it for my from
an old ring barrel when I was littler.

103
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,594
Who'd have thought that loop-de-hoop
would end up bein' my special talent?

104
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:03,591
Wow, Apple Bloom! That's amazing!

105
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:06,184
That's it? That's your talent?

106
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,863
Spinning a hoop around
your waist? Puh-lease.

107
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,259
Oh. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

108
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:34,232
Apple Bloom! You're super-duper
loop-de-hooper!

109
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:36,782
Thanks, everypony.

110
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:41,200
All right, my little ponies!
Time for class!

111
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,595
Apple Bloom.

112
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,502
Yes, miss Cheerilee?

113
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:52,640
I want you to take your
loop-de-hoop into the yard...

114
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,363
...and give us all a lesson in
your amazing loop-de-hooping!

115
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,289
Oh! Oh!

116
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:20,867
Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you
might get to be half as good as me.

117
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:26,655
Great job, girls!

118
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:28,555
You're too kind, Apple Bloom.

119
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,246
Yeah, we stink.

120
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:33,326
Nah. You just need a little practice.

121
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:34,945
Soon you'll be able to...

122
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,598
Hoop'n'bob!

123
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:40,358
Hoop'n'hop!

124
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:43,581
Hoop'n'skip!

125
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,753
And hoop'n'flip!

126
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:56,852
Show us some more, Apple Bloom.

127
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:01,203
Well, alright. Just a few
more tricks. But be warned...

128
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:04,753
...these are advanced moves.
Not for beginners.

129
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:07,564
Got that, Diamond Tiara?

130
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,205
I call this one the hoopla!

131
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,957
Another cutie mark? Ha!

132
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,700
I guess that last trick
was a lot of hoopla.

133
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,899
Those cutie marks are fake!

134
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,593
What? No, they're not!

135
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:48,729
Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard
of a pony with two cutie marks?

136
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,395
I must say that I never have.

137
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,900
But maybe Apple Bloom
has two special talents?

138
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,223
Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that.

139
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,744
-Spin plates!
-Yeah!

140
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:08,777
Two cutie marks?

141
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:10,901
Two talents?

142
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:14,605
Aw yeah!

143
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,748
Our friend is the most
special pony ever!

144
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:23,576
Alright, everypony!
You ready for a real show?

145
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:30,336
Yeehaw, little sis!

146
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:34,793
Huh, congratulations on gettin'
not just one but two cutie marks.

147
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:37,754
Oh, we're mighty proud of you.
Right, Big McIntosh?

148
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,006
Eeyup.

149
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:42,570
I've never seen anythin' like it.
Have you, Big Mac?

150
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:43,885
Nnope!

151
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:48,754
Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and
a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin'...

152
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:51,951
...reminded me of when
I was a spry young filly.

153
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:54,996
Charlie horse! Charlie horse!

154
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,695
That's better.

155
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:03,558
Why, Apple Bloom. I think you're ready
to hit the rodeo circuit right now.

156
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,633
Actually, I'm ready to
hit the hay right now.

157
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:10,686
I'm plum tucker.
I'll see y'all in the mornin'.

158
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:11,763
'night!

159
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:13,044
'night!

160
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:17,326
Oh my! Little Apple Bloom
has finally blossomed!

161
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:20,066
-Hasn't she, Big Mac?
-Eeyep!

162
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,672
What in tarnation is that?

163
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:37,131
Apple Bloom. What is all that awful...

164
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:39,892
...tapping?

165
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,085
Three cutie marks?!

166
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:45,182
Help me!

167
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:50,870
Help me!

168
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:52,847
Come 'ere, you!

169
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:04,769
I'm sorry, Applejack!
I don't know how to make it stop!

170
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,352
Well, I know somepony who might.

171
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:14,318
Three cutie marks? Three talents!

172
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,117
I've never seen anything like it!

173
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:19,356
I was just reading something
about unusual equine illnesses.

174
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,176
What was it?

175
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,776
"Perplexing Pony Plagues", perhaps?

176
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:28,437
Yes, Spike! You're amazing!

177
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:32,116
Yes, well, I do have some talents.

178
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:40,120
Hay fever... the trots...

179
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,224
Cutie pox!

180
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:44,255
Cutie pox?!

181
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:47,506
Cutie pox – this puzzling
pony plague afflicted...

182
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:50,547
...the population of ponies
back in the paleopony period!

183
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:53,048
Say that ten times fast.

184
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,076
Random cutie marks appeared
all over the ponies' bodies...

185
00:14:58,077 --> 00:15:01,008
...causing them to perform all
the talents that came with them.

186
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,839
Just like me!

187
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:05,760
Yes, but what's the cure?
What's the cure?

188
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,153
It says here there's no known cure.

189
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,372
No known cure?!

190
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,478
The cause of the breakout
was never discovered.

191
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,681
And the cutie pox disappeared
as mysteriously as they arrived.

192
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,552
Oh no!

193
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:25,789
Sacré bleu! Plus de marque de cutie!
[Good heavens! Another cutie mark!]

194
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,467
Qu'est-ce que c'est? Je parle français?
[What's that? I speak French?]

195
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:32,680
My sister's speakin' in Fancy!

196
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:33,841
She needs help!

197
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:37,517
I know she needs help!
We can't just wait for this to go away.

198
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:41,479
We gotta find somepony
to mix up a cure! And fast.

199
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,358
Tout suite!
[Now!]

200
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,709
Not somepony. Some zebra!

201
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:48,447
Zecora!

202
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,449
Hurry! Hurry!

203
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,262
Dépêchez-vous!
[Hurry up!]

204
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:29,231
She's cursed!

205
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:31,441
Hexed!

206
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,548
Enchanted!

207
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,154
No, she's not.

208
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:41,799
She just has some weird, mysterious disease
with no known cure, called cutie pox.

209
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:44,308
CUTIE POX?!

210
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:59,501
I thought I have removed their fear
the last time I visited here.

211
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:02,529
But doors are barred and shutters shut.

212
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,560
Guess I should have
stayed inside my hut.

213
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:08,880
Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox.

214
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:13,301
We were just on our way
to see if you've had a cure!

215
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:16,678
But magically you're here!
Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?

216
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,324
My zebra sense did not bring me 'round.

217
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:22,151
It was a special flower
that I needed found.

218
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:25,769
I thought I picked enough to fix
all the potions I had to mix...

219
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,065
...but after my visit from Apple Bloom...

220
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:32,015
...some have mysteriously left my room.

221
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:36,283
Apple Bloom, what do you say?
Did this flower just walk away?

222
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,482
I... um...

223
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,684
A cutie pox cure I have forsooth.

224
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:54,201
For healing power is
in the seeds of truth.

225
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,845
W... well then. Give 'em to her! Quick!

226
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,632
These seeds must be
planted in the ground.

227
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:03,345
With the truth they'll grow
and the cure is found.

228
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:04,944
Come again?

229
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:09,211
The seeds of truth do hold the cure,
but one must speak words...

230
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:11,853
...true and pure.

231
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,826
Well then, let's get to it!

232
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,195
Alright. They're planted.

233
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:23,903
Now somepony tell the truth!

234
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:38,422
Somepony! Anypony!

235
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:44,331
Yesterday I told Mrs. Cake
that I ate two corn cakes...

236
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,761
...but I really ate three!

237
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:52,883
Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes!

238
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:02,593
Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!!!

239
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:06,775
Oh, I can't stand it anymore!

240
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:11,717
It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn
my cutie mark! They're all fake!

241
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:21,370
I figured the heart's desire would
help me get what I wanted most...

242
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:25,423
...so when Zecora left her hut,
I mixed up a special potion...

243
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:27,558
...and put the rest
of the heart's desire in it!

244
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,709
Whoa...

245
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:47,975
Apple Bloom!

246
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:49,274
Are you okay?

247
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:53,290
I'm great. And I've never been
happier to be a blank flank.

248
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,600
But I'm awful sorry I lied.
Especially to you, girls.

249
00:19:58,183 --> 00:20:01,829
I was so desperate for my cutie mark,
I just got carried away.

250
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:05,896
And I'm really sorry I snuck those
flowers from you, Zecora.

251
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:09,644
Why, I wouldn't blame you if you
never wanted me to come by again.

252
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,592
Now, Apple Bloom. Do not be silly.

253
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:15,043
You are always welcome, my little filly.

254
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:21,036
With each mistake you learn something new,
growing up into a better you.

255
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:26,829
Apple Bloom, would you mind
writing to Princess Celestia...

256
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,337
...and telling her what you learned?

257
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:31,143
I'd be happy to, Twilight. Spike!

258
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:32,311
Ready!

259
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:35,138
"Dear Princess Celestia."

260
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:38,199
"Waiting for what your heart
desires can be really hard."

261
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,332
"So you may try to take a shortcut."

262
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:45,061
"But this dishonesty never works, because
you didn't earn what your heart desires."

263
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:48,267
"The only cure is being honest
with yourself and others."

264
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:50,942
"And that's something
every heart desires."

265
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,272
I sure am proud of you, sis.

266
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:59,592
Seems like you've finally learned
the importance of patience.

267
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,152
Yep! All good things
come to those who wait.

268
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:07,637
Well, I've waited long enough.

269
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:11,601
Actually, that was way too long.

270
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:12,204
What?

271
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:15,104
So what are we gonna do today
to earn our cutie marks?

272
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,884
Well, I was thinking.

273
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:19,165
For a pony, who's never
mixed up a potion before...

274
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,301
...you sure stirred up something fierce.

275
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:24,142
Yeah! So what if your talent
is potion making?

276
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,537
Oh my gosh! Totally!
Let's go talk to Zecora! Now!

277
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:30,934
-Yeah!
-Woohoo!

278
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,429
