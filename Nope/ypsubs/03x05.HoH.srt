Something drew you to my shop...

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,040
something powerful.

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,240
SHOPKEEPER:
Ah, you have a keen eye.

6
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,490
The Alicorn Amulet
is one of the most mysterious

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,340
and powerful
of all the known magical charms.

8

I'm afraid this is...
far too dangerous.

Don't be scared, little friends.
Twilight is wonderful with magic.

16
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,720
Anything happens to them, Twilight,
so help me.

17
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,550
Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy,

18
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,970
Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better
since she accidentally

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,160
crushed me and Applejack
with a giant snowball.

20
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,950
Of course she's good with magic.
Twilight's great with magic.

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,330
I guess I just don't want
my little friends to be scared...

22
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,690
Oh, oh, look how scared they are!

( animals chittering )

24
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,920
I promise, Fluttershy,
nothing bad will happen to them.

25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,550

Twilight, that looks amazing!

30

Whew!

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,460
That's all for now, little ones.

32
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,170
Maybe we can practice again later,
if Fluttershy says it's alright.

Your magic has really improved
since we came to Ponyville, Twilight.

35

- Princess Celestia's gonna love it!
- Thanks, Spike.

36
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,430
I have to be at my best when she arrives
with the delegates from Saddle Arabia.

37
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,370
I can't believe she's trusting me
with the entertainment.

42

Come on, Applejack. We've got
to get her into a nice, soothing pink.

43
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,550
STAT!

44

Twilight Sparkle.

- What's she doing here?

48

You call that
"great and powerful"?

49

SNIPS: No, this way!

Stop picking on my friends, Trixie!

56
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,380
You and I
have some unfinished business.

57
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,350
My magic's gotten better
since I was here last.

58
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,360
And I'm going to prove it!

59
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,220
Me and you.
A magic duel.

60

Winner stays,
loser leaves Ponyville forever!

61
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,520
Forget it!
I'd never make a deal like that!

Why are you doing this?

66
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,950
Why?
Because you humiliated me!

67
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,760
After you showed me up
with that Ursa Minor,

68
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,270
I became a laughingstock!

69
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,260
Everywhere I went
I was laughed at and ostracized.

70
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,760
I even had to take a job on a rock farm
just to earn a living!

71
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,170
A rock farm!

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,750
Hey! You're lucky a rock farm
would take the likes of you!

73
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,930
Now I want revenge!

74
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,070
And I'll just keep casting spells
'til you agree.

75
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,580
Well?
What do you say?

I won't set hoof in Ponyville again.

Without Spike,

I can't get a message

I'm trying my best, but...
I can't stop thinking about Trixie.

162
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,680
There was something different
about her.

163
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,524
It's like she's gone
from high and mighty

164
00:10:57,675 --> 00:10:58,800
to mean and nasty!

165
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,060
Your thinking needs a readjust.
Total concentration is a must.

166
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,874
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

167
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,790
This really doesn't seem
to be getting us anywhere.

168
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:24,540
( muffled whimpering )

169
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,260
I hear you, Pinkie.

170
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,550
I can't find anything that describes
the kind of magic Trixie's doin'.

171
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,880
There must be something!
Twilight has every magic book there is!

172
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,070
Um, I think I may have found something?

173
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,010
Yes, it's time for us
to consider our futures

174
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,490
in this new Trixie-led Ponyville.

175
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,030
Um, this sounds an awful lot like
Trixie's magic--

176
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,570
She wants me to grow apples
with no peels!

177
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,780
How the hay am
I supposed to do that?

178
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,130
Um, there's a picture here
of that necklace--

179
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:53,330
( muffled shouting )

180
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,120
It's called the Alicorn Amulet,

181
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,840
and whoever wears it
is blessed with untold--

182
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,240
Hey, everypony, look!

183
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,240
This book has a picture
of Trixie's necklace!

184
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,430
It's called the Alicorn Amulet,

185
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,540
and whoever wears it
is blessed with untold powers!

186
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,500
If you read a little further,
you'll see--

187
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,070
Even though it provides great power,
it also corrupts the user!

188
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,510
Yes, but, um, you can't--

189
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,970
You can't just
take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck.

190
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,730
It has a magical lock!
Trixie's the only pony who can take it off!

191
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,460
Maybe--

192
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,790
We need to get
this information to Twilight.

193
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,670
- She'll know what to do.
- But, how--

194
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,760
If any of us try to leave,
Trixie's magical forcefield will tell her!

195
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,860
- Maybe we should--
- I've got it!

196
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,140
Trying to sneak past the forcefield
would be impossible without help.

197
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,400
But I know who's got the goods
to get into those woods!

198
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,820
- Fluttershy!
-What?!

199
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,950
What do you say, Fluttershy?
Can you handle the mission?

200
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,490
No! I'll crack under the pressure,
I'll snap like a twig!

201
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,240
Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak out
of Ponyville and find Twilight.

202
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,030
But I-- I--

203
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,550
FLUTTERSHY:
Okay.

204
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,390
- Alright!
-Let's do it!

205
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,790
I know just the design
for a dangerous mission outfit!

206
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,388
( Snips & Snails grunting )

207
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,640
Pull, you fools!

208
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,210
Somepony set off the magic forcefield,
and Trixie intends to punish them!

209
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,560
But wouldn't it be faster
if we had some... wheels?!

210
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,290
The Great and Powerful Trixie
doesn't trust wheels.

211
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,000
Now pull faster!

212
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,740
I'm telling ya, Snips,
she's getting weirder and weirder!

213
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,790
Stop!

214
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,370
You there!
What are you doing?!

215
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:48,473
( chittering )

216
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,190
Why is she so mean to us?

217
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,620
Yeah! I miss the days
when she was just a fraud!

218
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,208
( chittering )

219
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,711
Oh oh dear!

220
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,860
Rarity's dangerous
mission outfit is ruined!

221
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,390
Guess we'd better go back!

222
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,658
( animals chittering
and chirping )

223
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:28,793
Oh. Okay, okay, you're right,

224
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:30,823
I need to be brave
and find Twilight.

225
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:33,740
- ( birds chirping )
- Oh! You found her?

226
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,730
She's in the Everfree Forest?!

227
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,330
Oh, this is me being brave!
I wanna be brave at home,

228
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,740
locked in my closet,
with my teddy bear!

229
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,340
I can't believe
I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!

230
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,360
The more she uses it,
the more it will corrupt her!

231
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,800
But how am I supposed
to beat that amulet?

232
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,590
My magic's not good enough!

233
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,390
Twilight Sparkle,
much work have you done.

234
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,590
You learned all of my lessons,
all but one.

235
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,150
If Trixie's tricks have you in a fix,

236
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,560
you must mix your magic
and use the six.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,020
Mix your magic, use the six...
mix your magic, use the six!

238
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,520
Use the six, that's it!
Zecora, you're a genius!

239
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,170
Now I need to get you back
inside Ponyville, Fluttershy.

240
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,550
This better not be
another false alarm,

241
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,460
or the Great
and Powerful Trixie will--

242
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,940
You!

243
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,780
What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle?
Not enjoying your exile?

244
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,940
I know about the Alicorn Amulet.
I know you cheated.

245
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,570
Cheated? Moi?

246
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,660
Yeah. And I thought
you might wanna see

247
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,860
what a real magical amulet looks like.

248
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,570
Zecora gave it to me.

249
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,570
It's from beyond the Everfree Forest,

250
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,100
and it's way more powerful
than your measly Alicorn Amulet!

251
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,000
Ha! Nothing's more powerful
than the Alicorn Amulet!

252
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,220
And nopony's more powerful
than the Great and Powerful Trixie!

253
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,090
TWILIGHT:
Care to put your amulet
where your mouth is?

254
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,600
How about another duel?

255
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,830
Why should I?
I already beat you.

256
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,510
That's up to you!
But I guess you'll never see

257
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,130
the totally awesome magic
from beyond the Everfree Forest...

258
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
Come on, Zecora.

259
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,900
Wait!

260
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,520
Okay, okay, you're on!
A second duel.

261
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,404
( thunder rumbling )

262
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:50,500
<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

263
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,590
Let's start with a simple age spell,
shall we?

264
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,880
Let's.

265
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,290
Snips, Snails.

266
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:03,631
( both crying )

267
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,500
An oldie, but a goodie.

268
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,790
Now let's see
what your little charm can do.

269
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,070
No problem.

270
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,530
Um, Applejack, Rarity?
Could you help me, please?

271
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:16,707
- Huh?
- Huh?

272
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,050
<i>( suspenseful theme playing )</i>

273
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:34,620
Ho-hum.

274
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,930
So you can do an age spell,
big deal.

275
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,908
<i>( majestic theme playing )</i>

276
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,580
That's-- that's impossible!

277
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,870
That's nothing!

278
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:05,094
Yow!

279
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,120
How did you--?

280
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,700
Duplication spell.

281
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,610
Ever seen one pony
play ten instruments?

282
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:17,259
( playing upbeat polka music )

283
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,480
This-- just can't be!

284
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,970
Ooh, one more.
I can turn a mare into a stallion.

285
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,060
( in deep voice ):
Eeyup.

286
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,140
Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet
is more powerful than yours.

287
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,900
Hey! Give it back!

288
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:46,300
( cackles )

289
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,880
With this amulet,
I shall now rule

290
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,990
all of Equestria!

291
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,133
( Trixie cackles )

292
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,280
Witness, my subjects,

293
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,110
gaze upon an ever
greater and powerfuler Trixie!

294
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,078
( cackling )

295
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:09,687
Hey!

296
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,520
I don't need
that old Alicorn Amulet.

297
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,610
I have this!

298
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:20,200
Ha-ha! Stop it!

299
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:23,110
Tha-that tickles!

300
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,290
Tickles?

301
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,780
That was supposed
to make you writhe in agony!

302
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,560
This amulet is defective!

303
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,660
Give mine back!

304
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,290
Sorry. This is going back
into hiding where it belongs.

305
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,540
By the way, Trixie,
the amulet around your neck?

306
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,700
It's one of Zecora's doorstops.

307
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,500
But...
how did you do those spells?

308
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,470
Nopony can do those spells!

309
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,320
You're right.
Not even me.

310
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,730
<i>Zecora taught me so much about
magic while I was in exile.</i>

311
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,280
<i>She even taught me
when not to use it.</i>

312
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,560
<i>My magic alone wasn't powerful enough
to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head,</i>

313
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,670
<i>so I needed to use
a different kind of magic...</i>

314
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,550
<i>the magic of friendship.</i>

315
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,160
I also knew that the only pony

316
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,500
who could get the amulet
off your neck was you.

317
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,430
But what about
the pony with the ten instruments?

318
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,250
That's not magic,
that was just Pinkie Pie.

319
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,315
( playing upbeat polka music )

320
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:22,262
( playing upbeat polka music )
( all cheering )

321
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:27,436

322
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:33,046
CROWD:
Ooh!

323
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,650
Trixie?

324
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,780
It's the least I could do.

325
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,200
I treated you and your friends so horribly
when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet...

326
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,510
I just couldn't control myself.

327
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,330
You can forgive me, can't you?

328
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,670
Hmm...

329
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,560
- Sure.
- Oh, great.

330
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,010
Don't you think
the Great and Apologetic Trixie

331
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,180
is the most magnificent humble pony
you have ever seen?

332
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:20,639

333
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:28,740
( muffled shouting )

334
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:31,032
( gasps )

335
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:34,033
