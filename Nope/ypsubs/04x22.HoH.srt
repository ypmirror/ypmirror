00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,681
has to expect a little fussin'.

39
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,160
But all I'm supposed to do
is settle disagreements

40
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,974
over whether a trade
is fair or not.

<i>And since the rule is</i>
<i>that a trade is fair</i>

42
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,683
<i>as long as both ponies</i>

44
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,514
So there's really no
reason for anypony

45
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,120
to treat me as
anything special.

46
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,200
Hi, can I help you?

47

<i>(groan)</i>

48
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,106
There's a pony here who's got
a signed, first edition

49
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:33,545
of Daring Do and the Quest
of the Sapphire Statue.

50
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,112
And I'm gonna get it!

51
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,201
I've been able to get first
editions of all the

52
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:39,057
Daring Do books except this one.

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,281
No pony's ever put
together a whole set.

If it hasn't been traded yet.

56
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:46,913
It's the only one
in all of Equestria.

57
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:50,620
Oh no! I'd really hate to
see you disappointed.

seems so important to you.

to help you first...

62
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,309
Normally, I'd say I
don't need any help.

63
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,719
But you're right: This
is really important.

64
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,410
I've gotta get that book!

65
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,800
Well, I'm off to take a gander
at some of the vintage stalls.

66
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,726
Did you say vintage?

67
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:16,829
Why, old and rare items
are so in style right now.

68
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:19,036
I'm hoping to get a
vintage item as well.

69
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,912
I just hope I brought
enough to trade.

70
00:03:22,187 --> 00:03:23,607
I know what you mean, Rarity.

71
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:27,615
Hey, why don't we pool
our trade stashes?

72
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:28,536
Pool?

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,231
That way, if one of us finds
something real valuable

74
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,497
she can't live without...

75
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,761
She'll definitely
be able to get it.

76
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:38,491
Who could say no to
exchanging a single object

77
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,400
for such a huge
assortment of items?

78
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:43,313
Oh, yes, that is
absolutely brilliant.

79
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,070
I'm so glad I have a
friend like you, Applejack.

80
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,935
I feel the same way.

81
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,729
Then let's go shopping!

82
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,799
Um, shouldn't Your
Princessness be heading

83
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,211
to the royal box seats?

84
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:02,702
I may be the princess on duty,
but I don't think that means

85
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:04,971
I have to sit up there
all alone doing nothing.

86
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:08,197
Ever since I became a princess,
Celestia has been sending me

87
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,639
more books to read than ever.

88
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,309
<i>The library is overflowing.</i>

89
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,006
So I figured
while we're here.

90
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,719
I might as well trade away some
books I don't need any more.

91
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,860
Mm hm!

92
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:21,693
(gasp) There it is!

93
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:24,800
The first edition of Daring
Do and the Sapphire Statue!

94
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,643
It hasn't been traded yet!

95
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,400
Lucky for you.

96
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:30,995
Because I've brought my
most valuable possession

97
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,247
to trade for it:

98
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:33,268
<i>(clang)</i>

99
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,449
<i>My lucky horse shoe.</i>

100
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't want it.

101
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:38,932
What?

102
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,149
It's just a rusty
old horse shoe.

103
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:43,121
That's not worth
anything to me.

104
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:47,904
But how is Rainbow Dash going to
get the book she really wants?

105
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,732
Well, she's not.

106
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:51,162

107

109
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:54,958
she can get me that.

110
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:59,309
<i>(snarls)</i>

111
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:01,449
Ooh, an Orthros.

112
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,852
<i>How cute.</i>

113
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,138
The pony running the
Ancient Beast Stall

114
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:07,822
doesn't want
anything I got.

115
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,985
But if you can get
me the Orthros,

116
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:13,200
I'll trade you
the book for it.

117
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,099
You got it!

118
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:21,504
I don't know how, but somehow
we're gonna get that Orthros.

119
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:28,476
Oh, Applejack!

120
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,333
I am so glad I found you.

121
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,372
Me, too. You're not
gonna believe it.

122
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,131
<i>(both at once)</i>
I found a super valuable vintage
item I just have to have.

123
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:36,993
And all it's going to
cost is all our stuff!

124
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,718
Uh-oh.

125
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:44,749
So where is this
valuable vintage item

126
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:47,129
you want to trade
everything we have for?

127
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:48,405
There.

128
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:51,004
Where?

129
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:52,064
Right there.

130
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,093
But that's a dented
old pie tin.

131
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:58,534
A dented vintage pie tin.

132
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,295
The metal they used to fashion
this one helps cook the pies

133
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:03,100
up to five seconds faster.

134
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:05,024
<i>They don't make 'em</i>
<i>like this anymore.</i>

135
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:08,595
I am so glad you showed
that to me, darling.

136
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:09,810
<i>(crash)</i>

137
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:11,440
Because once you
see what I found,

138
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,898
you won't want to waste
our trade goods on that.

139
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:18,158
<i>Just look at this</i>
<i>gorgeous vintage brooch.</i>

140
00:06:18,398 --> 00:06:19,879
It's one of a kind.

141
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:24,837
It looks exactly like the
one you're already wearing.

142
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:27,079
Well, yes, they
may look the same.

143
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,323
But I know it's older.

144
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,505
That's what makes it
so much more divine.

145
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,690
But that doesn't
make a lick of sense.

146
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,739
Why I wager if I
switched 'em up,

147
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,540
you wouldn't even
know the difference.

148
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,600
Oh, don't be silly;
of course I would.

149
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,759
So which is the vintage one?

150
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,756
That one, of course.

151
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:54,156
Ha! You're bluffin'.

152
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:55,471
Am I?

153
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:56,762
How can you tell?

154
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:58,487
Well, because...

155
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,427
Agh! I can't.

156
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:02,710
'Cause the one you want to
waste our whole stash on

157
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:05,028
is exactly the same as
the one you already got.

158
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:07,477
There's no way anypony
would notice the difference.

159
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:10,954
I'd say it's a lot more
likely they'd notice that

160
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,186

Stop that!

Come on! Don't you
start now, too.

170

OK, I can see you're busy, so
I'll give it to you straight.

<i>A whole stand filled with</i>

00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:19,137
They really do have everything
at the Traders Exchange.

181
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,098
Will you trade a lamp
for my horse shoe,

182
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,960
so I can trade it for an
Orthros and get my book?

183

No.

184
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,701
But I'd trade it for
an antique chicken.

185
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,710
Great!

186
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,898
What's an antique chicken?

187
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:36,374
Oh, I got all kinds of
antique chicken statues:

188
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,711
I got your Blue Hens,
Speckled Greys, your...

189
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,417
OK, cool.

190
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,241
So will you trade
one for a horse shoe,

191
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,349
so I can trade it for a lamp and

Well, let me think.

194
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:50,640
Uh, no.

<i>(sighs)</i>

196
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,775
But I'd gladly trade one of my

202
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,598
So what are you
willing to trade for?

203
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,986
I'm guessing it's gotta
be some crazy thing

204
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:11,880
way across the Exchange.

205
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:15,342
Actually, I could use a
slightly rusty old horse shoe.

206
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:18,571
Yeah, but where am
I gonna find...wait!

I've got one of those!

208
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,407
Now that we've got the chalice,
this is gonna be a cinch.

209
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:25,640
Do you really think so?

210
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,062
All we gotta do is bring this
thing to the chicken stand

211
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,055

215
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,460
All right fine, you got
yourself a dea--

216

Stop! What are you doing?

217
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:47,336
I was trying to get rid of all
the books I don't need anymore.

218
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,421
For that?

219
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:51,619
Do you really want that?

220
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,074
Well, not really.

221
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,526
But I'm running out of
library space, so-

222
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,949
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!

223
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,172
I can't believe that
almost happened.

224
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,940
But luckily it didn't happen.

225
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:01,699
Thanks to me.

226
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:02,950
What are you talking about?

227
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,381
According to the
rules of the Exchange,

228
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:07,309
a trade is only fair
if both ponies end up

229
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,370
with something they want.

230
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:10,540
You can't break
the rules.

231
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,604
Did anypony see you do it?

232
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:13,644
I don't think anypony saw.

233
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,167
But you're not going to
say anything, are you?

234
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:19,342
Just kidding.

235
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,234
Or am I?

236
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:21,637
Sometimes I can't
even tell...

237
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,600
You know, if you
want to go check out

238
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,080
the rest of the Exchange and
trade whatever you brought...

239
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,452
Nope. I just came
to pony watch.

240
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,058
I'm not going anywhere.

241
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,216
I won't let you make a
mistake like that again.

242

Hey, Everypony!

243
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,260
Step right up.

244
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:40,206
Do not walk.

245

Gallop over here for your

chalice mosaic I'm making.

254
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,296
All right, so what kind of
antique chicken do you want?

255
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,942
<i>I got speckled, brown, grey...</i>

Oh, no!

257
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,824
The pony we're supposed to
trade the chicken statue to

258
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,274
didn't tell us what
kind he wanted.

259
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,340
OK, look, I'm fast.

260
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,262
I'll fly over to the
lamp stand and find out

261
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:24,218
what kind of
chicken he wants.

262
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,279
Just don't let anypony trade for
any chicken while I'm gone, OK?

263
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:30,538
Um, well, OK.

264
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:31,951
Um, I can do that.

265
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:32,696
I think.

266
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:39,157
Uh, well, maybe you
shouldn't get one of those.

267
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:43,157
You know, unless
you really want to.

268

Well, since we can't
both get what we want,

273
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:58,958
I will be the
better friend.
