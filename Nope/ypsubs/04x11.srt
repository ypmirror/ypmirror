1
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:07,038
Mail's here!

2
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:09,256
Please be a "yes".

3
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,033
Please be a "yes".

4
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:11,178
Please be a "yes".

5
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:14,610
YES!

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,374
She can make it!
She can make it!

7
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:18,979
Going out on a limb here,
but I'm guessing that

8
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:21,680
Princess Cadance said she
can come this weekend.

9
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,132
I'm finally going to get to
spend some quality time

10
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:25,291
with my sister-in-law.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,492
This is the best news EVER!

12
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:32,472
Um, so sorry for
barging in like this.

13
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:36,466
But I'm so excited I just
couldn't wait to tell somepony.

14
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,885
The Equestrian Society for the
Preservation of Rare Creatures

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,808
has given me permission to
observe the rarest, tiniest,

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,913
most adorable magical creatures
in all of Equestria!

17
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,252
The Breezies!

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,111
Wow, Fluttershy,
that's fantastic!

19
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:54,522
Oh! It's not just fantastic;

20
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,635
it just might be
the best news EVER!

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,420
I just got the most incredible
mail anypony's ever received

22
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,717
in all of recorded
pony postal history!

23
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:10,378
It's a flyer about a one-day
sale on used patio furniture!

24
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:12,501
Ah! Could this day
get any better?

25
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:13,873
Whoo hoo!

26
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:26,600

27
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,514
Here's a wrap in
case it gets cold.

28
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:07,004
And I packed you a basket
of nice fresh apples

29
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,156
in case you get hungry!

30
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:09,664
Have a great time.

31
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:10,833
Oh, I will.

32
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,371
And I hope you have
fun with Cadance!

33
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,667
ALL Aboard!

34
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:23,906
Goodbye! Goodbye, everypony!

35
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:25,508
Fluttershy!

36
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:30,762
I'll never
forget you!

37
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:36,185
Ooh, something floaty!

38
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,319
La la la la la.

39
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:40,501
I'm a bit nervous
about Cadance's visit.

40
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:42,626
What could you be
nervous about, Twilight?

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,922
Cadance just loves
you to pieces!

42
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:45,908
I know.

43
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:48,316
But I really want her visit
to go without a hitch!

44
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:50,290
Why wouldn't it?

45
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,135
Well, the last few times
we've seen each other

46
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:55,525
haven't exactly
been "worry free."

47
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:58,142
The fate of Equestria
has hung in the balance

48
00:02:58,152 --> 00:02:59,711
during most of
your visits with her.

49
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:00,866
Exactly.

50
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:02,684
Cadance and I haven't
really had a chance

51
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:04,448
to just enjoy being
friends again.

52
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:06,952
Which is why it is so important
that this visit be about

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,467
the two of us having some
real quality time together.

54
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:12,171
I'm guessin' you've got a
plan that'll keep it that way.

55
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:14,107
The timing couldn't
be more perfect.

56
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,944
For one day only, right
here in Ponyville.

57
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:19,896
The 'Starswirl the
Bearded' Traveling Museum!

58
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:22,007
Cadance and I can spend
the whole day looking at

59
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:23,385
Starswirl the Bearded artifacts.

60
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,748
Sounds like the
perfect, drama-free way

61
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,012
to spend the day
with Cadance.

62
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,051
Not counting the drama
surrounding which of the bells

63
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:31,071
from his cloak they've
chosen to put on display.

64
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:33,920
Spoiler alert: It's this one.

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,687
Uh, heh heh, sorry.

66
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:40,794
Something in my throat
like a big ball of "lame?"

67
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,108
I think it sounds delightful.

68
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,678
Yep. Definitely sounds
like you two will have

69
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,666
some real quality
time together.

70
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,694
Exactly.

71
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,388
Just quiet time.

72
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,513
Your Highness.

73
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:10,835
Your Highness.

74
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:15,361
I'm teasing, Twilight.
We're sisters-in-law;

75
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,899
we don't have to be so formal.

76
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:26,485
Knowing you, you've
made some plans.

77
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,888
Boy, have I. Hang on
just one second.

78
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:30,850
You guys...

79
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,566
Now, now, don't you
worry about a thing!

80
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:36,360
We'll make sure that
nothing, but nothing,

81
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:37,970
interferes with your visit.

82
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:41,235
Go on! Have a hootenanny
with your kinfolk.

83
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,394
You really are the best friends
a pony could ever have.

84
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:46,520
Coming, Cadance!

85
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,266
Ha! Two sisters-in-law bonding.

86
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:53,227
Well, I for one am
gonna make sure

87
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,655
that nothing spoils
their day.

88
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,788
<i>What is that thing?</i>

89
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,883
Whatever it is...DUCK!

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,432
Rarity, That doesn't look
anything like a duck!

91
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:08,712
What is that?

92
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:13,816
<i>Not a what</i>
<i>but a "who," dear.</i>

93
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:17,471
Oh, no, that sounds like...

94
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,082
DISCORD!

95
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,583
What in tarnation
are you doin' here?

96
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,225
And why the jumpin'
junebugs are you blue?

97
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:35,836
More like a shade of
cerulean, to be precise.

98
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,753
Whatever color you are
is the color of trouble!

99
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:41,750
Oh, Rainbow Dash,
I've changed!

100
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,833
Surely you remember
I was reformed

101
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:49,849
by lovely little Fluttershy!

102
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:52,708
What are you?

103
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:53,752
Sick or somethin'?

104
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:56,249
Well, of course I'm sick!

105
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:58,236
The blue skin?

106
00:05:58,647 --> 00:05:59,822
These sneezes?

107
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:02,597
Could somebody find
me a fainting couch?

108
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:06,245
What?

109
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,039
Charming, thank you.

110
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,677
I can't stop sneezing
and wheezing.

111
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:17,732
In short, I need help.

112
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:22,060
If you're so sick, why have
you come here instead of...

113
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:25,955
y'know, staying home in bed and
getting over your weird illness?

114
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,860
Because this condition
has left me helpless.

115
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:34,782
Simply helpless.

116
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:39,642
Why, I can barely lift a spoon.

117
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:47,123
I came to find the one pony
who truly understands me

118
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,699
and could nurse me
back to health.

119
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:52,577
Where is that dear,
sweet Fluttershy.

120
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:53,884
I need attention!

121
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,543
I need some care!

122
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,809
I need...

123
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,273
You need to chill!

124
00:06:58,774 --> 00:06:59,902
Fluttershy's out.

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,432
Oh, of course.

126
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:03,367
Her trip to see the
Breezies.

127
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,486
Ah yes, I had forgotten
that was today.

128
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,103
How do you know
about her trip?

129
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,993
She told me about
it in her last letter.

130
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,427
You and Fluttershy write
each other letters?

131
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:15,787
Of course we do.

132
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,268
We're friends.

133
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:20,997
It's just such a shame
that today of all days

134
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:23,320
is when I really need her.

135
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,371
Oh, well. I know
what to do.

136
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:28,101
Good thinking, head on
home, put your feet up.

137
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:29,477
I'm sure eventually
you'll have the strength

138
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:31,299
to make yourself
soup or something.

139
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:33,613
No, no, no.

140
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:37,781
I mean while she's gone, you
ponies can take care of me.

141
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,617
Isn't that what
friends are for?

142
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:41,771
Taking care of
each other?

143
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:45,377
Let the healing begin!

144
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:46,677
Not it!

145
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:51,383
Well! That's some way to
treat a suffering friend.

146
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:56,087
Don't you worry, Discord,
I'll give you cuddles

147
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:58,128
and read stories and
tell you all about me!

148
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,037
I was born on a Tuesday....

149
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,251
You're so sweet to offer.

150
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:04,595
But Rarity and Applejack
already volunteered

151
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,889
to be my own personal
nursemaids!

152
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,696
We did?

153
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:12,386
I SO hope you don't
mind, Pinkie Pie.

154
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,221
Well, as a matter of
fact, I most certainly...

155
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:19,266
Hey! Who keeps throwing away
these perfectly good balloons?

156
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:21,836
That joker's
up to somethin'.

157
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,271
And whatever it is, we're
gonna keep it as far away

158
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,442
from Twilight and Princess
Cadance as possible.

159
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:30,039
You're right.

160
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,589
We promised we wouldn't let
anything ruin their visit.

161
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:35,360
Although I do so wish that
"anything" had turned out

162
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:36,544
to be something else.

163
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,626
Did I hear you two talking about
Princess Cadance's visit

164
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,794
with Princess Twilight?

165
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:44,220
Maybe.

166
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:46,784
Fluttershy had mentioned
that those two

167
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,836
were getting together today.

168
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,218
How wonderful for them both.

169
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:53,121
It is so rare that those two
get to see one another.

170
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:56,019
I don't know about you, but I
sometimes wonder how close

171
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,143
they could actually be.

172
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,515
<i>All those years apart</i>
<i>before being reunited?</i>

173
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:02,745
They're plenty close.

174
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,490
And if they're not, this rare
opportunity to focus

175
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,937
on their friendship will
certainly bring them closer.

176
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,139
Unless...

177
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:10,175
Don't even
think about it.

178
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,738
They mustn't be disturbed.

179
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:13,086
Disturb them?

180
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,308
Why I wouldn't dream of it.

181
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:16,840
Not when I have two such
dear friends of my own

182
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:18,784
who have already offered
to take care of me.

183
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:20,499
And at such peril.

184
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:23,356
This flu of mine is highly...

185
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:27,525
Contagious.

186
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,594
Oh no! I've gotten
you both sick.

187
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:40,485
Whomever shall I turn to
now in my time of need?

188
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:47,486
A whole day to celebrate
Starswirl the Bearded.

189
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:48,975
What could be better?

190
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:51,200
Absolutely nothing!

191
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:55,006
Is that the candlestick
he used to light the way

192
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:56,989
when he was exploring the
caverns of Maretania?

193
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,550
It sure is.

194
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:01,361
Oh, I can't believe I'm getting
to see it in real life!

195
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,532
Discord! What are
you doing here?

196
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:20,487
Oh, dear, dear Princesses,
I'm sorry to say I'm sick.

197
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:24,421
Blue Flu.

198
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,966
Blue Flu?

199
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:29,404
I fear I've already given it
to poor Applejack and Rarity.

200
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:36,335
Magic health bubble.

201
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:37,771
Good thinking.

202
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,973
Indeed.

203
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,790
How would Twilight
nurse me back to health

204
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,366
if she was sick, too?

205
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,423
You will be letting
me stay at your place

206
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,093
until I'm all
better, won't you?

207
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:47,578
Stay?

208
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:48,755
With me?

209
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:51,397
Uh, now is not
really the best time.

210
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,297
Though I'm sure you
already knew that.

211
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:56,130
But taking in the sick
and the desperate:

212
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,085
isn't that what
Fluttershy would do?

213
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:02,078
Isn't "helping" something
that friends do for friends?

214
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,022
Unless, of course,

215
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:07,869
you're really saying that
you're not my friend.

216
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:12,308
No. That is not
what I'm saying.

217
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:15,006
Oh, how elated I
am to hear that.

218
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,480
Shall the three of us
head back to your place?

219
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,180
I don't want to get
anypony else sick.

220
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,459
I guess we don't have
much choice.

221
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,130
Carry me?

222
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,979
It isn't far.

223
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:31,018
I think you can manage.

224
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:32,682
Oh. poo

225
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,855
Need anything else?

226
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:42,280
Just knowing that I have
a good friend like you

227
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,830
to take care of me has
made me feel better already.

228
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:49,566
I'll be fine here on my own.

229
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,765
Oh. Just before you go.

230
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:57,925
Just a little, small request.

231
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,334
It's going to be fine.

232
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:03,032
We'll just get him
what he wants

233
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,188
and be back to the
exhibit in no time.

234
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,276

00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:13,806
All right. This
is ridiculous.

291
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,044
How did you even
catch this flu?

292
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,238
Inadequate hoof
and claw washing?

293
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:20,407
There must be some
way to just cure you.

294
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:23,223
There has to be a spell or
a remedy in one of my books.

295
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:25,342
<i>There is one way!</i>

296
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:28,526
And you didn't think to
mention it earlier?

297
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,599
Slipped my mind.

298
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:33,598
<i>On a hill at the very</i>
<i>edge of Equestria,</i>

299
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:36,442
<i>there grows an</i>
<i>exquisite magic flower.</i>

300
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,834
<i>Pick the flower as it</i>
<i>drops its petals at sunset.</i>

301
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,493
<i>Then you can make a</i>
<i>magical, soothing elixir</i>

302
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:44,612
<i>to cure the Blue Flu.</i>

303
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,303
I suppose you have a good
reason you didn't bother

304
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:50,298
to go get this flower

305
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:51,896
as soon as you
realized you were sick?

306
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,718
Well, I couldn't travel
that far in my condition.

307
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,012
By the time I got
there, I'd be too weak

308
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,397
to even attempt to
retrieve the flower.

309
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:03,174
So where exactly are
Cadance and I headed?

310
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:07,529
Well, you want to head north,
turn left at the--Oh.

311
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,741
You know, it would
be much easier

312
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,600
if I took you
there myself.

313
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:16,378
I thought you were in
"no condition" to travel.

314
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:18,134
I'm not.

315
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:20,160
We'll need to make
some arrangements.

316
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:30,981
Doing OK there?

317
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,286
To be honest, I'm a
little out of practice

318
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:35,516
when it comes to flying.

319
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,882
<i>Well! Then lucky for you,</i>
<i>we're here.</i>

320
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:44,813
It's just at the
top of that hill.

321
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,948
I'm really sorry
about this.

322
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:53,356
All I wanted was for us
to have some peaceful,

323
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:54,468
quality time together.

324
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,486
I know. I was looking
forward to it, too.

325
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:04,173
This is the top.

326
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:05,863
But where's that flower?

327
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:15,274
Oh.

328
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:16,282
Come on.

329
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,460
If we hurry, we can still
have some time together.

330
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:28,786
One last pull.

331
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:36,487
Whew! Let's get Discord and
this flower back home,

332
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:37,974
then all our problems...

333
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:39,319
What in Equestria?

334
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,059
Twilight! Help!

335
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:06,382
Get your coils off
my sister-in-law!

336
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:13,629
Aaahh!

337
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,809
Let go of my sister-in-law!

338
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,133
Thanks!

339
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,583
Don't thank me yet!

340
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,516
Just a little more.

341
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,883
And for good measure.

342
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:50,448
Are you OK?

343
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,433
Yes. Better than
OK, actually.

344
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:56,766
Then let's get Discord
back to Ponyville,

345
00:17:56,862 --> 00:17:58,848
make that elixir, and
finally get a chance

346
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,835
to spend some quality
time together!

347
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:06,854
<i>To the ends of Equestria!</i>

348
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,479
To face such great danger!

349
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,544
And she did it for me.
She did it all for me!

350
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,316
For me! For me!

351
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:20,840
YOU...

352
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:21,980
WERE...

353
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,155
FAKING?

354
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:24,454
I was.

355
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:26,708
But I had a very
good reason.

356
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,123
We're listening.

357
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:31,941
Well, I was in my
thinking tree.

358
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:34,786
That's where I do most of
my really deep thinking.

359
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:37,067
I was there and I
said to myself I said.

360
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:41,077
Discord, your friend Twilight
says that she's your pal,

361
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,757
but she never writes and she
never pops in for a visit.

362
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,140
I don't even know
where you live.

363
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:48,565
Now that she's a Princess,

364
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:51,071
<i>maybe she's decided that</i>
<i>she's too good for you.</i>

365
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,426
I have never considered
myself too good--

366
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:54,741
But how was I supposed to know

367
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:57,797
for sure that I'm
truly still friends

368
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,154
with one of the most
important ponies around?

369
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:01,502
I'm not more--

370
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:04,487
By seeing if you would go
to the ends of Equestria

371
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,130
for me, of course!

372
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:08,040
Which you did. Literally.

373
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:13,104
Congratulations, Twilight,
you passed my friendship test!

374
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:21,379
Why the angry eyes?

375
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:23,223
You love passing tests.

376
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,310
It's not because my little exam
put a damper on your visit

377
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:27,797
with Princess Cadance, is it?

378
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:30,054
Made it so that there was
no time for you two

379
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,803
to focus on your friendship?

380
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,744
You didn't put a damper
on our visit at all.

381
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,461
I didn't?
He didn't?

382
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,480
Spending the day at the
Starswirl the Bearded exhibit

383
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:43,541
would have been more
relaxing, but to be honest,

384
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:45,761
relaxation is the
last thing I need.

385
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:46,967
It is?

386
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:48,511
Don't get me wrong.

387
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,977
Life in the Crystal
Empire is wonderful,

388
00:19:51,414 --> 00:19:54,821
but it's become a
little... predictable.

389
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,697
I enjoy a little
excitement now and then.

390
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:00,323
Getting to face all
these challenges today

391
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,654
was just what I needed.

392
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:05,164
And facing them with you just
made me realize even more

393
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:08,193
how lucky I am to have
somepony like you as a friend.

394
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,781
We may not see each
other very often,

395
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,409
but I know you'll always
be there when I need you.

396
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:19,166
Just like she was
there for you, Discord.

397
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,159
Yes. She's a
real sweetheart.

398
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:23,486
We're all so lucky to
have her in our lives.

399
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,083
What in the world?

400
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:44,534
<i>I think it's pretty clear that</i>
<i>my visit with Cadance</i>

401
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,538
didn't go quite the
way I expected.

402
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,841
But in the end, I realized that
when you're with a good friend,

403
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:53,164
even the most chaotic day can
end up being a great experience

404
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:54,238
that brings you closer.

405
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:56,913
Wouldn't you agree, Discord?

406
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,358
Yes, Twilight.

407
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,468
I don't wanna go sayin'
you got what you deserved.

408
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,694
Well, I have no
trouble saying it.

409
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:06,542
You got what you
deserved!

410
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:07,574
Now, now.

411
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:09,180
He's learned his lesson.

412
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:11,728
Isn't that right,
my little patient?

413
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:14,710
I'm so glad that you're back
from your trip, Fluttershy.

414
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:17,959
Just your presence here is
making me feel so much better.

415
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:20,813
I was just wondering.

416
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:23,802
Could I trouble you for
just one more thing?

417
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:24,825
No!

418
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:26,171
What?

419
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:30,706
I was simply going to ask for
a teeny tiny glass of water.
