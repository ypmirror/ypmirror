1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,360
Welcome to the Grand
Equestria Pony Summit!

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,900
You delegates have
traveled far and wide

3
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,340
to represent your cities

4
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,649
as we seek to
celebrate and learn

5
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,184
from all the unique places

6
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,733
that make up our wonderful
land of Equestria.

7
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,173
At tonight's welcome
reception, Princess Cadance

8
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:41,733
will dedicate this beautiful
friendship statue,

9
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,708
made up of gemstones from
each of your home cities.

10
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:53,786
Now I'd like to
turn things over

11
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,790
to the one who
organized the Summit,

12
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:57,820
Princess
Twilight Sparkle!

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,379
Thank you, everypony.

14
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:03,622
With delegates from
over fifty cities

15
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,392
attending three days of
conferences, receptions,

16
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:07,356
and meetings,

17
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:10,678
this is the largest Grand
Equestria Pony Summit yet.

18
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,215
And let me tell you,
putting it all together

19
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,630
has led to more than one
sleepless night.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,192
We're so excited to have you
here and to learn more

21
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,775
about life all across this
great land of ours!

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,459
And now, my faithful
assistant Spike

23
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:29,062
would like to say
a few words.

24
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:33,043
Um, hello, everypony.

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,596
I'm here to help any way I can,

26
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:38,011
so if there's anything I
can do for any of you--

27
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,060
We love you,
Princess Twilight!

28
00:01:40,163 --> 00:01:41,908
We love all the princesses!

29
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:47,615
I guess everypony
loves a princess.

30
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:00,610

We have muffins!

31
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,142
Agh!

32
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:35,984
Spike!

33
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:38,506
Spike?

34
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:40,220
Little help?

35
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:44,114
Spike, we need you!

36
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,064
Of course! What
can I do?

37
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,965
Spike: Whoa! What
happened to you?

38
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:53,226
Oh, I'm sorry, Spike, I just

39
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:58,826
need a quick nap...napkin.

40
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,914
Tell the delegates I'll...

41
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:05,257
She's been awake three straight
days preparing for the Summit.

42
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,737
We need to make sure she
gets some rest today.

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,156
She'll never be able to
attend the welcome reception

44
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:11,394
in this condition.

45
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,470
Can I count on you to see to
it that she isn't disturbed?

46
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,436
I promise I won't let you down.

47
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:38,678
Perfect.

48
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:45,306
Not on my watch.

49
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:49,260
Uh, excuse me?

50
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,070
Can you keep it
down a little?

51
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,041
Oh no!

52
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,571
I'll give you
birdseed...worms...

53
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:01,310
anything!

54
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:03,600
Just please stop singing
before you wake the Princess!

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,672
Huh. I can't believe
that worked.

56
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:27,169
Ah!

57
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,918
Uh, hi fellas. Sorry
to break up your game,

58
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,540
but there's sort
of an important

59
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,571
diplomatic summit
kinda thingy going on

60
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,672
and it involves a princess
needing to sleep and uh,...

61
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:42,773
maybe you could move
your game somewhere else?

62
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:50,323
The Princess thanks you
for your understanding!

63
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,144
Excuse me!

64
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,744
Do you have to do
this right now?

65
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,099
HA-CHEW!

66
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:57,363
Oh no!

67
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,531
Are those Dragonsneeze Trees?

68
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:04,160
These are too top heavy.

69
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:06,194
Wouldn't take much to
bring these beauties down.

70
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,946
Can't you just wait a few hours?

71
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,718
Sorry, it's a public hazard.

72
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:12,636
I've got my orders.

73
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,937
Well, I've got my
orders, too...

74
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:18,377
from Princess Twi-Twi-Twilight.

75
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,453
HA-CHEW!

76
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,022
Princess Twilight?

77
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:24,312
Oh! Why didn't you say so!

78
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,529
Gee, I reckon they'll
keep a few more hours.

79
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,213
Good thing I've got the
princesses on my side.

80
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,502
Aw, come on!

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,358
EXCUSE ME!

82
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:40,240
EXCUSE ME! SIR!

83
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:41,676
I REALLY NEED YOU TO--

84
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,344
--STOP RIGHT NOW!

85
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:44,681
Oops.

86
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:46,495
Let me guess, the noise?

87
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:49,493
Sorry, but we can't have
a broken water main.

88
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:51,718
What, you couldn't
do this yesterday?

89
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,339
Hey, pal, I'm just tryin'
to make sure everything

90
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:55,878
runs smooth for the Summit.

91
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:58,502
But there is no Summit
without Princess Twilight!

92
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:01,493
And she needs things to
be kept quiet around here.

93
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:02,925
So if you don't mind, I'd--

94
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,512
All right, all right, if that's
how she wants it.

95
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:08,095
But if something happens,
it ain't my fault.

96
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,440
Hm. Princess Twilight
will be rested;

97
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,280
Princess Cadance will be proud

98
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:26,579
and Princess Spike
deserves a little reward.

99
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,470
Princess Spike. Heh-heh!

100
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,634
All right, I worked
forever on this thing.

101
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,929
Uh, hi, can I help you?

102
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:41,100
My friend here, the
distinguished pony

103
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:44,171
from up Manehattan and I are
in a bit of a pickle,

104
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:47,055
and we need the Princess
Twilight to resolve it.

105
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:50,845
Can you talk a little quieter?
And maybe come back later?

106
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:52,533
Oh, sure now, gosh,
I wish we could,

107
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:54,697
but uh, we're both
supposed to give speeches

108
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:57,081
about our local economies
in five minutes.

109
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,299
And we've been booked
in the same hall.

110
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,440
I had the room first,
and let's be honest,

111
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,215
my speech is more important.

112
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,912
Point of order there, sir,
but I think you'll find

113
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:09,158
that my speech is the more
important one, dontcha know.

114
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,179
Look, youse is gonna have
a lot of unhappy delegates

115
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,224
on your hooves unless
we get a ruling

116
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:16,121
from Princess
Twilight right now.

117
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:24,049
Let me see what I can do.

118
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:38,491
Huh? Does something
need scheduling?

119
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,198
Oh, uh, yeah.

120
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,518
Two delegates have speeches
booked in the same hall.

121
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:43,748
What do I do?

122
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,097
OK, no problem.

123
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,908
Just put the hay in the
apple and eat the candle.

124
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:49,443
Huh?

125
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:53,946
I need an answer!

126
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:55,672
But Twilight can't
even think straight.

127
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,510
Oh my gosh! What am
I supposed to do?

128
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:04,986
Well? What did she say?

129
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:06,502
She picked me, right?

130
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:07,554
Hey hey hey!

131
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,049
Let's not be too
hasty there, good sir.

132
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,148
I got a feeling
she went with me.

133
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,152
Hey, hey if she
didn't pick me,

134
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,577
it ain't hard to see that as an
insult to all of Manehattan.

135
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:18,674
You know what I'm sayin'?

136
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,971
And it'd sure be a
shame to see something

137
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,360
like a scheduling issue
create a nasty old rift

138
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:25,417
between Whinnyapolis
and Ponyville.

139
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:28,201
So? What did the
Princess say?

140
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,232
Come on now,
spit it out!

141
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:34,156
Ummm, she said that,
well, she said, that she,

142
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,822
she wants you to ... share it?

143
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,617
If that's what the Princess
wants, what are you gonna do?

144
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,293
The Princess is always right.

145
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:47,535
No hard feelings; this
is not about you and me.

146
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,609
And now back to more
important things.

147
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:00,609
Combining those two
talks was a disaster!

148
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,041
The hall was overcrowded

149
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:04,049
and the speakers just
shouted over each other!

150
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,139
Huh? But--

151
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,504
Why would the Princess
have made such a decision?

152
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:11,310
Uh-oh.

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,512
Uh, by order of Princess
Twilight...be quiet!

154
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,371
I was really looking forward

155
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:27,634
to the "Don't Spend
All Your Bits" speech,

156
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,638
but when I went into the
hall, a pony had taken my seat.

157
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:35,081
A pony who used to be my friend!

158
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,285
Your friend took
your seat? Big deal.

159
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:39,104
Why don't you just--

160
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,483
No offense, but I don't need
some random dragon's opinion.

161
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,310
I want to hear what
Princess Twilight thinks.

162
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,249
Ugh. Fine.

163
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:57,188
Uh, the Princess says no
friendship should end

164
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,007
over a seat.

165
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,615
You should forgive your friend.

166
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:04,544
Of course! Oh, the
Princess is so wise!

167
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:08,320
I could tell these
delegates anything

168
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,354
as long as they think it
came from Twilight.

169
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,419
All right, who's next?

170
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:58,819
So how can Princess
Twilight be of service?

171
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,396
Well! As host city, the
Canterlot delegation

172
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:05,276
feels it's only right
that we should get passes

173
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:07,440
to every meeting
and party, yes?

174
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,207
Well, that's doesn't seem fair.

175
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:12,811
I mean, Princess Twilight
doesn't think that seems fair.

176
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,718
Yes, yes, very well.

177
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,495
It was worth a try,
though, wasn't it old chap?

178
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,579
This is great!

179
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,361
I just took care of a
whole bunch of stuff

180
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,457
that Twilight won't have to
worry about when she wakes up!

181
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:29,344
Wonder if anypony else
needs the Princess's help.

182
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,645
If I can check a few
of these meetings

183
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,009
off Twilight's schedule,

184
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:40,194
then when she wakes up,

185
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,594
she won't have to think about
anything but the reception.

186
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:51,001
Uh, says here you have a
meeting with Princess Twilight?

187
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,573
Yuppers. She wanted
me to prep her on all the

188
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:58,628
different gemstones in the
Citizens of Equestria statue

189
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:00,411
before the reception tonight.

190
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:01,805
OK. Go ahead.

191
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:07,337
Um, well, I'd rather um,
tell the Princess directly.

192
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:10,796
Well, if it helps, you can
call me Princess Spike.

193
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,078
No no no! It's all right!

194
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,420
The Princess asked me to take
care of a few things for her.

195
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:18,765
That's why I came to find you.

196
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:21,664
If you say so.

197
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,436
The Princess says so.

198
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,805
OK, let's start with topaze.

199
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,030
I'm here for your 2:00.

200
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,796
You?

201
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,520
But I'm supposed to be
briefing Princess Twilight

202
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,100
on the progress with
the water main.

203
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,982
I speak for the Princess.

204
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,680
Well, uh, can I start
fixing it again?

205
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:43,641
I'm gettin' a little
worried, to be honest.

206
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:47,333
Actually, Twilight still needs
her rest and her "no noise"

207
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:50,400
policy is still in effect
for a few more hours. Sorry!

208
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:55,211
Hey Spike, what's going on?

209
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:58,415
Oh, you know, just settin'
em up and knockin' em down.

210
00:12:58,849 --> 00:12:59,756
What do you mean?

211
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:03,188
Not only have I kept things
quiet so Twilight could sleep,

212
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,226
I also took care of all her
afternoon meetings

213
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,969
so she won't have to worry
about them when she wakes up.

214
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:10,963
Are you sure she'd
want you doing that?

215
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:13,737
There are so many things to
keep track of at this Summit.

216
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:16,148
Ah, don't worry,
I got it covered.

217
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:19,687
I know Twilight so well, it's
easy to make decisions like her.

218
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:21,687
Oh. OK.

219
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:25,340
Well, thank you for keeping
Twilight's stress level down...

220
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,975
...as long as that's the
real reason you're doing it.

221
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,550
Well, why else
would I be doing it?

222
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,032
You're not enjoying speaking
for Twilight a little bit?

223
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,308
Enjoying it? Ha ha! No way!

224
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,651
The only things I'm doing
by order of the Princess

225
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:41,969
are for the good of the Summit.

226
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,003
Heh heh heh heh.

227
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,059
By order of the Princess.

228
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:01,516
By order of the Princess.

229
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,954
By order of the Princess.

230
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:15,455
Ah. Princess life is good.

231
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,201
It sure is. But it's also
hard work, isn't it?

232
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,710
Eh, it's not so bad.

233
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:27,466
Spike, I'm concerned you might
be abusing your relationship

234
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:28,346
with Twilight.

235
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:31,154
What are you talking about?
I'm a great princess!

236
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,912
I mean, Twilight's
a great princess

237
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,546
and I've been working
hard to help her!

238
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:37,527
When two delegates
had a falling out,

239
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,020
I'm the one who fixed
their friendship!

240
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:41,097
I listened to that pony
drone on about gems

241
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:43,268
for forty-five minutes so
Twilight wouldn't have to!

242
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:45,980
I moved a polo match away from
the tower so she could sleep!

243
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:48,643
And I didn't even eat that
delicious looking statue!

244
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:50,731
I'm a decision-making master!

245
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:58,083
OK, so maybe I did get a little
carried away making decisions.

246
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,217
But it's not like
anything bad happened.

247
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,378
Whooooaa!

248
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:23,775
This is unexpected.

249
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:26,929
I'll go shut off the main;
you get rid of the water!

250
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:02,902
At least the statue's OK.

251
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:07,360
Oh no.

252
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:08,868
Oh no!

253
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,794
Ah...Ah...HACHEW!

254
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:19,493
Aw, bless me.

255
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,352
Oh my!

256
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,281
What is the meaning of this?

257
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:34,735
Well, uh, ya see, there
was this polo game and--

258
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,857
How could you let
a water main burst

259
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,876
on Canterlot's most
important day?

260
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,156
Hey, don't look at me.

261
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,986
Princess Twilight said
to stop working on it.

262
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:44,819
Well, what about these trees?

263
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,801
I ordered them trimmed to
avoid just such a situation!

264
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,897
Well, the princess
told me to stop, bub.

265
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:52,948
Why would the Princess make
such horrible decisions?

266
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,742
This all could have
been prevented!

267
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,847
Please! Everypony, listen!

268
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,988
I'm so sorry all this happened!

269
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:01,577
What are you apologizing for?

270
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:03,977
These were Princess
Twilight's awful decisions!

271
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,967
I'm about to blow my stack
on Princess Twilight,

272
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,076
I'll tell you that for nothin!

273
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,059
Yeah, me too!

274
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:12,499
I'll not let Princess Twilight
give Canterlot a bad name

275
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:13,695
in the eyes of Equestria!

276
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,531
Come on, everypony, let's go
give her a piece of our mind!

277
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:20,320
Wait, you've got it all wrong!

278
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:30,011
WAIT!

279
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:33,756
I mean... wait.

280
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:35,348
What is it now?

281
00:17:35,516 --> 00:17:37,992
There's an angry mob here
that demands satisfaction!

282
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:39,428
It's just that, uh,

283
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,363
we don't want to wake
the Princess, do we?

284
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:42,952
Wake her? What?

285
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,017
You're tellin' me
that she's asleep?

286
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:56,106
Princess! We must speak at once!

287
00:17:56,243 --> 00:18:00,156
SHE... IS...SLEEPING!

288
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:13,078
I'm glad you're here, Spike.
We've got a lot to do.

289
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:14,956
Do you know if the
water main was fixed?

290
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:17,935
Uh, you seem well rested.

291
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:20,563
I haven't slept like
that since I was a filly.

292
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:21,535
You haven't?

293
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,836
Well, at least I
got one thing right.

294
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,268
And it was the one thing
Cadance asked of me.

295
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:29,241
Maybe I did do a good job today.

296
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:36,518
Fancy Pants. What's wrong?

297
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,708
Don't play games
with me, Princess.

298
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,114
You know why I'm here!

299
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,586
Is this about the special
privileges you wanted?

300
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,165
Because this seems
a little extreme.

301
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,299
Special privileges?

302
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:50,224
The last thing on my mind
is special privileges!

303
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,918
What's going on, Spike?

304
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,499
Um...you needed to sleep!

305
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,948
And Princess Cadance told me
you weren't to be disturbed!

306
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:02,297
And there was this bird,
and well...long story short,

307
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,687
I made a few decisions
on your behalf.

308
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,327
"A few decisions?"

309
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,704
Well, maybe more than a few.

310
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:15,531
But I had good
intentions. Honest!

311
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:19,760
Until I didn't anymore.

312
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:21,687
I'm sorry, Twilight.

313
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,186
I guess I got a
little carried away.

314
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,965
It just felt so good to have
ponies caring about my opinions

315
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,436
on such important matters.

316
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,520
I guess I was just enjoying
feeling like a princess.

317
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,466
Well, Spike, one of the most
important things a princess

318
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:41,028
can do is realize when she's
made a mistake and fix it.

319
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:42,445
How do I do that?

320
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,160
You could start with them.

321
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:50,350
Uh, hi there, everypony.

322
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:55,055
So I guess I owe you all
a pretty big apology.

323
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:58,144
It's funny, here we
are at a Summit

324
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:01,051
that brings together ponies
from all across Equestria

325
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:03,721
and all I could think
about was myself.

326
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,116
You all came here to celebrate
the things that make

327
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,805
each of our cities so
unique and special.

328
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,815
But instead of getting
into the spirit of things

329
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,068
like all of you...

330
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,323
I used my friend's position
to make myself feel good.

331
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,805
The Canterlot ruby
goes here, old sport.

332
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:39,112
And ours goes
here, dontcha know.

333
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:57,645
Does this mean you forgive me?

334
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,180
Sure!

335
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,217
You know the whole idea of the
statue is that when each of us

336
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:05,969
plays our own small part, it
adds up to somethin' grand.

337
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:08,838
Quite! Just like
how all our cities

338
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:11,379
make up the beautiful
land of Equestria.

339
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:14,948
I hereby dedicate the
Citizens of Equestria statue

340
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:17,828
to everypony who
plays their part,

341
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,495
no matter how big or
how small.

342
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:27,173
Aw, come on!

343
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:31,158
Ah...ah...ahhhh--
