1
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:06,798
<i>OK, everypony, as you know,</i>

2
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:09,648
the adorable fairy
creatures known as Breezies

3
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:11,662
are about to come
through Ponyville.

4
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:14,505
Yes! It's so exciting!

5
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:16,881
I can't wait for Rainbow Dash
to make the breeze for them

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,287
so I can see how cute
they are up close!

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,080
I've never done it before.

8
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:23,120
Not that I won't be
totally awesome at it.

9
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:24,675
Because I totally will.

10
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:26,899
And that breeze
is very important.

11
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:29,775
But so is cheering on those
teeny, tiny little things

12
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:31,990
so they have the confidence
to ride that breeze

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,975
to their native land.

14
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:35,020
Did I mention how tiny they are?

15
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:36,238
So tiny.

16
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:40,768
I was thinking we could do
a special Breezy cheer.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,480
I LOVE CHEERS!

18
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:46,419
But these cheers
should be quiet cheers.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,672
We don't want to
startle them.

20
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:49,518
They need to be
able to concentrate.

21
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:51,990
Why don't we try it?

22
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:53,970
You can do it, Breezies.

23
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:56,185
YOU CAN DO IT, BREEZIES!

24
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:56,872
Oh my.

25
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,735
Sorry, Fluttershy, I had
no idea how hard it was

26
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:02,421
to do a cheer quietly.

27
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,345
It's OK. Quiet doesn't come
naturally for everypony.

28
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:07,758
Let's try it again.

29
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:10,474
YOU CAN DO IT, BREEZIES!

30
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:13,465
Perhaps just a
little bit quieter.

31
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:16,050
You can do it, Breezies!

32
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:17,992
Just a little quieter.

33
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:20,682
You can do it, Breezies!

34
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:22,144
PERFECT!

35
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:25,160
Oh, um, I mean...yay.

36
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:37,720

37
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,499
That's too strong!

38
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:24,930
We've gotta slow
this breeze down

39
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,061
or we're going to blow
those Breezies apart!

40
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:32,181
What I don't understand is
why they need the Pegasi

41
00:02:32,197 --> 00:02:33,514
to make a breeze for them.

42
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:36,013
Well, you see,
it's the breeze

43
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,003
that activates the
Breezie's magic.

44
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:40,585
And that magic protects the
pollen they're carrying

45
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:41,806
from being destroyed.

46
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:46,731
So no breeze means no magic
means the pollen goes bad?

47
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:47,787
That's right.

48
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:50,450
And they only have two days
to get that pollen back

49
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,987
before the portal to
their home closes.

50
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:55,209
That's why it's
ever so important

51
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,890
that we help them make their
way through Ponyville safely.

52
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:00,214
We certainly wouldn't
want to scare them

53
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,925
and divert them from their path!

54
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:03,836
Now you understand.

55
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,120
You certainly know
a lot about them.

56
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:07,832
Oh, thank you.

57
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,748
I went to see them
gathering their pollen

58
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,055
in Western Equestria.

59
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:20,987
Um, Rarity, I hate
to weigh in with you

60
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:23,059
when it comes to fashion, but--

61
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,875
There's too much
purple on this, isn't there?

62
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,071
I KNEW it!

63
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:29,272
But Twilight
refused to admit it.

64
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,530
What? I--

65
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:32,794
No, no.
It's the perfect amount of purple.

66
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:36,450
It's just that there's an awful
lot of sequins on your jacket.

67
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:41,094
Oh, darling, please! One can
never have too many sequins.

68
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:43,523
You can if they
reflect the sun

69
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,912
and the light catches a group of
Breezies right in their eyes

70
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,914
and blinds them long enough to
get them off their course

71
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,061
so they never get home!

72
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:50,969
I stand corrected.

73
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,891
I suppose there is
the rare instance

74
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,599
where one can have
too many sequins.

75
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,267
I'll just take
off my jacket.

76
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,292
I suppose this won't do either.

77
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:10,989
Everypony, it's time!

78
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,549
Please welcome the Breezies!

79
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:28,645
They're as cute as Apple
Bloom on the day she was born!

80
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,371
And would you look at those
adorable little packs

81
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:32,798
they carry their pollen in.

82
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:37,514
So! Cute!

83
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:39,586
Can't! Take! It!

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,345
Pinkie Pie! Can I hop on you
so I can see the Breezies?

85
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:56,238
May! Explode!

86
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,520
OH NO!

87
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,826
Slow down the breeze for
the other group to catch up!

88
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,399
They're too far back!

89
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:30,466
We can't connect the breeze
to both sets of Breezies!

90
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,093
What if we speed it up?

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,626
Then the first group
will be going too fast

92
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,532
and will get separated
from each other!

93
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:09,674
<i>Manglemarsh mooth!</i>

94
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:10,868
He's right!

95
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:13,670
You must all gather as
close as you possibly can!

96
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:25,360
Muggledy Sarken dose?

97
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,053
Oh. I understand the language
of all kinds of creatures.

98
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:31,059
You must be so proud.

99
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:33,365
And you speak my language, too?

100
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,546
I can. This lot can
only understand you.

101
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:39,422
Clearly, they're not the
brightest bunch around.

102
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,901
THAT...WAS...AMAZING!

103
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,868
I'm sorry we couldn't
get a breeze going

104
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:48,558
that would get them
back to the others.

105
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:51,385
Oh, it's not your fault.

106
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:53,797
I for one am very proud
of you, Fluttershy.

107
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:55,637
Leaping into action
like that.

108
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:58,560
I feel like I should design
you a special hero's gown.

109
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,446
Or a sash. At least a sash.

110
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,818
<i>OK, OK, OK!</i>

111
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:06,437
I know what you're all thinking.
Why don't you just say it?

112
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:08,848
I'm sorry!

113
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,770
<i>This is all my fault!</i>

114
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm so, so sorry!

115
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:15,687
Oh, Spike, it's OK.

116
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,892
It could have happened
to any one of us.

117
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,744
OK. Thank you!

118
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:26,891
Uh, I'm just going to
stay over here.

119
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,335
So Fluttershy, you want us to
get the breeze going again

120
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,163
so these little guys
can get a move on?

121
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,683
Maybe we should wait
just a moment or so.

122
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:39,584
They've been through so much.

123
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,332
Just give me the word when
you think they're ready.

124
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,746
Oh my, Twirly, you look
like you need a blanket.

125
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:05,328
Sampkin.

126
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:06,337
No problem.

127
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:08,550
Melanky?

128
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:11,200
Oh. Did you need
some more water?

129
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:18,766
Now who else needed a
hoof-knitted sweater?

130
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:22,712
Hey there!

131
00:08:22,913 --> 00:08:23,557
Can we come in?

132
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:24,720
Oh, of course.

133
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,452
But watch your step.

134
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,678
Oops. Sorry about
that little one.

135
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,974
We just wanted to see if you
thought the Breezies were ready

136
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:32,954
to give it another try.

137
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:34,887
Has it been an hour already?

138
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:36,062
My goodness.

139
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,343
Time flies when you're making
sure little creatures

140
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,890
don't feel that you're
abandoning them

141
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,229
<i>to the cruel world.</i>

142
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,594
But they're not going
to a cruel world, right?

143
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,123
They're going home.

144
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,861
Oh yes! That's right.

145
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:56,848
On second thought.

146
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,782
I don't think
they're quite ready.

147
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,524
Marshkin pupskin larfer!
Farclop pannywafer!

148
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:06,751
Uh, what did he say?

149
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:09,521
I'd rather not say.

150
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:13,077
OK, well, I'm sure you
know what you're doing.

151
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:15,935
No one knows rare magical
creatures like you do.

152
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,510
We'll just wait for your word.

153
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:18,464
Thank you.

154
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:20,179
I'll be in touch very soon.

155
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:24,587
We need to go NOW or
we will never get home!

156
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,201
I wish we did not need
that stupid breeze

157
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,534
to activate our magic

158
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:31,709
or I would just force you
all to fly home right now!

159
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:34,985
Why do we have to need magic
to keep our pollen safe?

160
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,558
Now Seabreeze--

161
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,556
Why are you giving
in to these wimps?

162
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,496
If they had not been so
scared in the first place,

163
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,408
this never would have happened!

164
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:46,177
Well, that is just
not true, Seabreeze.

165
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:49,752
It was because of a
leaf and you know that.

166
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:51,278
Oh, please!

167
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:54,066
They have no idea what
they're doing out there!

168
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,683
Like you said, we need as
much time as we can get,

169
00:09:57,818 --> 00:10:00,068
because they are so incompetent!

170
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:04,212
Well, I didn't say that
exactly, now did I?

171
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:05,233
Huh!

172
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,870
Oh, well, maybe a snack
will lighten the mood.

173
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,696
Munfarzen.

174
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,904
You're excused.

175
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,553
Well, my Breezies? I
think we can all agree

176
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:29,779
that now that you've eaten and
you have a little energy

177
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:31,237
going in your Breezy bodies,

178
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:33,617
you're strong enough
to face the breeze!

179
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:37,250
I've loved having you here and
I hope I've made you all feel

180
00:10:37,264 --> 00:10:38,320
loved and special.

181
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,767
But you have to go; no
pony here will deny that.

182
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:44,628
<i>There is nothing special</i>
<i>about these losers!</i>

183
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:48,044
They cannot handle a
simple breeze home!

184
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:52,025
If they could just stick with
the program and listen to me,

185
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,323
we would be safe! AT HOME!

186
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:58,778
Home! Where everybreezie
is like us!

187
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,488
OK. Well.

188
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:11,845
A confusing pep talk,
but nonetheless,

189
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:13,955
I do know that if you
don't leave soon,

190
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,198
you may never make it back
and that would be terrible.

191
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:19,998
Achoo!

192
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:21,338
Multy marshkin follow.

193
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,891
MULTY marskin toomba too.

194
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,678
I had no idea you
all have colds!

195
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:32,021
Really? All of you?

196
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:37,030
Oh dear. I can't let you
go out there sick!

197
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:39,843
What kind of a friend would
I be if I made you go now?

198
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,666
Hey, Fluttershy.

199
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,056
Just wondering if the
Breezies are ready to go yet.

200
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,040
Clock's kind of ticking
for them to make it back

201
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,777
before the door
closes on their home.

202
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:04,282
Oh yes. I mean, not quite.

203
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:06,236
Um, maybe just a
few more minutes?

204
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:09,564
Uh... all right.

205
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:11,880
We wait too much longer,
we'll have to create

206
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:14,614
such a strong breeze it may
be more than they can handle.

207
00:12:15,498 --> 00:12:17,428
We just have to
trust Fluttershy.

208
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:19,420
She must know what
she's doing.

209
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:39,049
Awwww!

210
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,861
Why are you spending
your time on this?

211
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:43,781
I will never get home!

212
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:48,134
Breezies, I must say,
Seabreeze has a point.

213
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:50,583
I think it's time for me to get
Rainbow Dash and her friends

214
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:52,813
so they can create the breeze
for you to get home.

215
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:58,969
Oh. You're all awfully anxious.

216
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:01,678
I don't want you
to feel abandoned

217
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:04,645
or that I wasn't the most kind
host I could possibly be.

218
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,335
Doshin bafin dorm.

219
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,864
Yes, that does make sense.

220
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:10,833
Seabreeze, do you
think you could wait

221
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:11,927
<i>just a couple more hours?</i>

222
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:17,568
Seabreeze? Seabreeze!

223
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:20,349
Has anypony seen Seabreeze?

224
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,859
Where is he going?

225
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,737
There's no way he can handle
being out there on his own!

226
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:24,154
<i>Excuse me, bees?</i>

227
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,479
Can you please back
off my Breezy friend?

228
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:28,848
He didn't mean any harm.

229
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,460
It was just an accident.

230
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:34,542
I'm working on a bee type dance

231
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:35,791
<i>and was hoping you</i>
<i>could help me.</i>

232
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:38,261
<i>Does this bring to mind</i>
<i>any images for you?</i>

233
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:39,668
<i>Perhaps a bee?</i>

234
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:43,233
<i>Excuse me!</i>

235
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,245
I have done NOTHING but be kind,
but I guess that is NOT working!

236
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,913
You bees know better than
to hurt a helpless Breezie!

237
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:55,484
I demand that you go away NOW
or you'll have to answer to ME!

238
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:01,112
Mankylin!

239
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:04,142
Thank you. Thank you so much.

240
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,415
Thank you for coming after me.

241
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,962
<i>Of course!</i>

242
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,720
You could have gotten
seriously hurt out there!

243
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,194
Ponyville is much too
dangerous for you!

244
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,467
One tiny acorn is a threat!

245
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:17,160
Yeah! I know.

246
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:18,973
That is one reason why

247
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,179
I have been trying to get us
to go from the beginning!

248
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:23,502
Oh my goodness.

249
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:26,979
I was just trying not to
hurt any creature's feelings,

250
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:30,347
my displays of kindness
may have cost you everything!

251
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:34,007
Time is running out and
you may never make it home!

252
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:37,330
That is exactly what I have
been telling all of them,

253
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:39,272
but they do not listen to me.

254
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:41,925
No Breezie
ever listens to me.

255
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,733
Seabreeze, I understand
your feelings are hurt,

256
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:49,305
but it's hard for them to hear
you when you're shouting

257
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,378
and being mean.

258
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:52,524
The message doesn't get across.

259
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,110
But what about those bees?

260
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,553
You were not nice to them

261
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:00,413
and that was the only
way they listened.

262
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:03,032
Yes, but they HAD to go.

263
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:05,914
And they wouldn't listen
to me any other way.

264
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:14,111
We need to go. Now!

265
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,525
<i>My dear Breezies,</i>

266
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:28,403
I had to rescue Seabreeze
from serious harm.

267
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,118
And now I know more than
ever that you must leave

268
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,302
before it's too late.

269
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:34,659
You would never
survive in Ponyville.

270
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,509
Mulshy barfin gorfis.

271
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,517
I can't help you anymore!

272
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,199
In fact, I wasn't helping
you at all by being nice.

273
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:48,074
But the truth of the matter
is that I must be firm!

274
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:51,867
You must go.

275
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:52,897
NOW!

276
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,028
It's too strong!

277
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,880
I can't do it any lighter!

278
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,066
Neither can I!

279
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:21,832
Fly back! I'm going to try and
see if I can slow it down!

280
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:28,731
Now it's too light!

281
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:30,735
This will never get them home!

282
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:36,489
Oh my. Maybe it's because
there are too few of them.

283
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,696
When they started their
journey there was more of them

284
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,277
to face the breeze together.

285
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:42,070
I've been studying
an old spell book

286
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:43,635
from the Castle of
the Two Sisters.

287
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:45,904
There's a spell that
I think could help us.

288
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:48,919
This is probably going to
feel a little funny at first,

289
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:50,417
but you're going to
have to trust me.

290
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:55,621
I love new ideas that make
me feel funny at first!

291
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:14,161
Whoo!

292
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,839
Marful fly bartontook.

293
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,007
Um, I mean, let's go.

294
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:55,908
Marshkin parskin.

295
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:56,932
Mikar.

296
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:58,895
You can do this.

297
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:01,432
I am sorry for how I
treated you before.

298
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:03,871
It was not right that
I called you names.

299
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,286
I did not even really believe
those things I said.

300
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:09,194
I was worried we would never
get back to our home,

301
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,485
and I lashed out.

302
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:14,796
I know you can do this.

303
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:16,501
I believe in you.

304
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,074
Hold onto me, let us
join the group.

305
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,937
Holy mini-sized paradise!

306
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,561
This is simply beautiful!

307
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,727
So much inspiration!

308
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,700
Where is my sketch
pad when I need it?

309
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:54,643
SO! STINKIN'! CUTE!

310
00:20:08,364 --> 00:20:09,621
You OK, Fluttershy?

311
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,848
I'm just so very happy they
got to be reunited

312
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:13,668
with their family.

313
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,909
We'd better get going
before the entrance,

314
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,047
<i>well, exit for us, closes.</i>

315
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:28,072
Goodbye, Breezies.
I must go now.

316
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:31,791
To remember us by.

317
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:36,470
Thank you.

318
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,711
I'll miss you.

319
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:39,073
I'll miss all of you.

320
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:42,247

<i>the Breezies</i>

321
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:45,096
<i>have helped me to see that</i>
<i>kindness can take many forms.</i>

322
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:48,534
<i>And sometimes being too kind</i>
<i>can actually keep a friend</i>

323
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,050
from doing what they need to do.

324
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,431
<i>Pushing them away</i>
<i>may seem cruel,</i>

325
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:55,387
<i>but it's sometimes the</i>
<i>kindest thing you can do.</i>

326
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:01,412
Whoa. That was a close one.

327
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:04,591
OK, gather around!

328
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:15,557
So, uh, I've always kind of
wondered what it would be like

329
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,887
to be a Gryphon.

330
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,229
Not a chance.

331
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,367
You sure? What about a
dragon? No?

332
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:25,855
It doesn't have to shoot fire!
