1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:03,996
Attention, everypony!

2
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:05,416
ATTENTION!

3
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,219
The official Rainbow Dash
fan club will come to order.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,051
Let's get right down to our
first order of business.

5
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:16,007
I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared
the most awesome pony in Ponyville.

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,491
I second the motion.

7
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:21,354
And might I add that if you looked up
the word "awesome" in the dictionary...

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,527
...there would be
a picture of Rainbow Dash.

9
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:26,728
I object!

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,582
I think the word
"awesome" is played out.

11
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,602
Rainbow Dash deserves better.

12
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:37,097
I motion that we declare her
the most stupendous pony!

13
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:39,864
"Stupendous"?
Is that the best you got?

14
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:42,267
I motion that we declare her...

15
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:43,745
...wonderrific!

16
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,294
-Astonishing!
-Breathtaking!

17
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:48,992
-Astounding!
-Bedazzling!

18
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:51,731
What about superultraextremawesomeazing?

19
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:57,995
All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash
the most superultraextra...

20
00:00:57,996 --> 00:01:02,299
...uh, whatever you said,
pony in all of Ponyville, say aye.

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,558
AYE!

22
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,692
What a beautiful day.

23
00:01:55,267 --> 00:02:00,216
There's nothing like a dip in the clouds
to make a pegasus feel super-relaxed.

24
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:02,182
Help! Help!

25
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:04,706
Help! Heeelp!

26
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,986
Looks like my sky swim
will have to wait.

27
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:13,672
I'm Rainbow Dash
and I'm here to rescue you!

28
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:25,011
Wow. What's with this crowd?

29
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,046
Uh... Thanks everypony.

30
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,961
It was really no big deal.

31
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:33,077
To me it was.
You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!

32
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,455
That Rainbow Dash sure is something.

33
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:44,176
Something special.

34
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,397
Oh no! There's something
wrong with the baby!

35
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:32,109
She's not cheering for everypony's
favorite hero: Rainbow Dash!

36
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:47,666
There just aren't enough
words in the dictionary...

37
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,447
...to describe Rainbow
Dash's awesomeness.

38
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,636
I can think of a few new words.

39
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:55,500
And I bet "modest" is not one of them.

40
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:04,031
No, but she is kinda awesome.

41
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,841
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood
Rainbow Dash is here!

42
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,693
-We'd be lost without you!
-You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!

43
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:38,707
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

44
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,269
I can't hear you!

45
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,343
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

46
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:51,795
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

47
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:54,625
Call me silly, but I think
this whole hero thing...

48
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,543
...might be going
to Rainbow Dash's head.

49
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:59,121
You may be right... silly.

50
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,592
And then I zoomed into the well.

51
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:07,528
I knew it would be dark and dangerous,
but I didn't let that stop me.

52
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:11,414
Danger's my middle name:
Rainbow Danger Dash.

53
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:15,415
Thinking back on it, I acted pretty
awesomely heroic that day.

54
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,782
"...that day."

55
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,581
Awesomely heroic that day and
awesomely arrogant ever since.

56
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,059
Hey, Applejack! How'd you like
to be immortalized as my friend?

57
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,357
Immorta-what?

58
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,037
Are you taking notes?

59
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,715
Yep! I've been hoof-picked
by Rainbow Dash herself...

60
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,501
...to write her autobiography.

61
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:41,062
Um... Autobiographies are supposed to
be written by the pony they are about.

62
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:44,091
Maybe for your normal,
run-of-the-mill ponies.

63
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:47,701
But I'm far too busy saving
lives to stop and write.

64
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:50,215
That's why I hired
Spike as my ghostwriter.

65
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,252
Aaah! Spike's a ghost!

66
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:59,903
Anyway, Spike here writes down
everything I say. Don't you, Spike?

67
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:03,507
"Don't you, Spike?"
Got it!

68
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:06,966
This way I can stay focused on
performing those acts of bravery...

69
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,547
...that nopony else
has the guts to perform.

70
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,485
Yeah, it takes guts.

71
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:13,287
But it also takes brains.

72
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,534
And sometimes a big lunch and a nap.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,690
Being a hero is surely
not for everypony...

74
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:21,042
...but I'm up to the challenge.

75
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:29,435
'ere you go.

76
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,834
Someday I wanna be just like you.

77
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:35,940
Aim high, kid, but don't
aim for the impossible.

78
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,586
Help! Heeelp!

79
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,275
Uh... Don't you think
you should go and help?

80
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:48,462
Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds
to spare. Just a couple more.

81
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,985
"The tension is unbearable."

82
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:59,490
"Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?"

83
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,123
Holy turnips! That pony
came out of nowhere!

84
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,176
I've never seen such
bravery in all my life!

85
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,817
That's right. Ponyville has a new hero.

86
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:32,518
A mysterious mare, that has
done well by our fair city today.

87
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,745
I dub this new masked hero
the Mysterious Mare Do Well!

88
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,053
Mare Do Well, huh?

89
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:45,823
Well, that mare would do well
to stay out of my way.

90
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:50,822
Ponyville's only got room for
one hero and that hero is me!

91
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:10,867
Never fear! Your friendly
neighborhood Rainbow...

92
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,902
Excuse me! Do you think
you could skip your catchphrase...

93
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:16,108
...and just hurry up and save us?

94
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:17,520
Ugh... Fine.

95
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,081
Picky, picky.

96
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:44,426
Oh, thank you, Mare Do... Well...

97
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:48,117
I can't believe it!

98
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:50,925
Mare Do Well is stronger than me?

99
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:54,475
Well, a hero is more than just muscle.

100
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:57,499
And she's gonna learn that the hard way.

101
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,074
Never fear, your friendly neighbor...

102
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:32,971
Never fear...

103
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:35,885
I'm coming!

104
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,584
Hold on!

105
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,208
Look!

106
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:05,973
Look out for the...!

107
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,775
Watch out for falling...!

108
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:10,690
Watch your left! Left!
Your other left!

109
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:15,115
Here you go. Safe and sound.

110
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:25,199
Well, Mare Do Well, or should I
call you Mare Do Slow?

111
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,881
You're gonna have to pick up the pace,
if you wanna compete with me...

112
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,760
...cause I move like lightning.

113
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:33,991
Actually, she saved all of us.
We owe her our lives.

114
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:48,042
Okay. She's strong, fast and somehow
knows what's gonna happen ahead of time.

115
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,855
I gotta step up my game.

116
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,972
If the dam breaks, the whole
town will be flooded!

117
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,933
Looks like Ponyville needs a hero!

118
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,720
Easy-peasy. My game
is officially back on.

119
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:16,355
If only somepony were here
to pat me on the back.

120
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:18,307
Huh. Guess I'll have to do it myself.

121
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,539
Heeelp!

122
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:30,840
Heeelp!

123
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:39,550
You?!

124
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:43,338
Huh. I *suppose* you
want me to thank...

125
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,229
You gotta be kidding me.

126
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:08,449
Let me get this straight.

127
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,506
She's strong, she's agile...

128
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:12,138
...and she's magic?!

129
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,417
How do I compete with THAT?!

130
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:20,487
Wait a minute.

131
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,321
I do have a leg up on her.

132
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:23,443
And that leg is...

133
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:25,371
Wings!

134
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,929
Ha! Take that, Mare Do Well!

135
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,983
Oh, for the love of Pete...

136
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:44,460
Gotta hand it to the girl.

137
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:47,897
That Mare Do Well sure can pull out
some pretty pretty heroic feats.

138
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:52,516
I must say I was impressed by that
spell she used to fix the dam.

139
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:55,587
Seems like something like that
would take quite a bit of study.

140
00:12:57,345 --> 00:13:00,486
She really cares about
everypony's safety.

141
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:03,890
Have you seen her costume?
It is to die for!

142
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:06,408
If you ask me, she's a hero of fashion.

143
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,593
And she's modest and humble.

144
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:11,226
She lets her actions
speak for themselves.

145
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:12,471
Gotta admire that.

146
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,505
I don't have to admire that!

147
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:16,574
I don't think she's all that great.

148
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:17,812
"She's great."

149
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,328
I didn't say that.

150
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,794
Sounds like somepony's jealous.

151
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:23,096
Who? Me?

152
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:24,546
"Rainbow Dash is jealous."

153
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:26,512
Don't write that, Spike!

154
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:33,723
"Correction: Rainbow Dash
is very jealous."

155
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:35,814
Fine! Laugh all you want!

156
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,047
But I'll be the one laughing when I prove
to you all that I'm just as good...

157
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:43,756
...no, that I'm a better
hero than Mare Do Well!

158
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:54,067
No sign of trouble here, darn it.

159
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:58,482
Buses and baby carriages are always
careening down this hill.

160
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:01,983
Where is an out-of-control vehicle
when you need one?!

161
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,471
There are absolutely no freak natural
disasters going on anywhere!

162
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:10,896
How am I supposed to prove myself
when everything's so normal and safe?

163
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,106
Hold it right there, Granny Smith!

164
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:15,604
You don't have to pretend with me.

165
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,298
I can see you're way
over your head here.

166
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,543
Yes, what's that?

167
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:23,207
You're putting on
a brave face! I get it.

168
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,108
But you don't have to anymore.

169
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,364
I'll help you cross the street.

170
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:31,938
Actually, I can cross
the street just fine.

171
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:38,192
Don't worry! You're
in extremely capable hooves!

172
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,531
Stop! Back off! Back off!

173
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,412
Here we are! Safe and sound.

174
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:53,079
A good and heroic citizen
deserves a little recognition.

175
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,433
Don't you think?

176
00:14:56,822 --> 00:15:00,476
I didn't want to cross
the street in the first place!

177
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,267
Somepony's in trouble!

178
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:12,586
You'd better let me handle this, ma'am.

179
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:16,404
For your own safety I must
ask you to stand back.

180
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:17,912
Oh, brother.

181
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:40,127
Ta-da!

182
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,941
Uh, thanks.

183
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,868
How would you describe what I just did?

184
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:47,900
Would you say I was... amazing?

185
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,746
Aren't you milking this a bit?

186
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,427
Please, just answer the question.

187
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,545
Was I or was I not amazing?

188
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:56,026
Oh, you're amazing,
all right. An amazingly...

189
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:57,366
Oh, look!

190
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:07,583
Another great feat of heroism.

191
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,083
I have just saved that grass!

192
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:11,260
From what?

193
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,274
From weeds!

194
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:16,250
Weeds that were attempting
to eat this lawn.

195
00:16:17,736 --> 00:16:19,290
Lame.

196
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:25,652
Oh, who am I kidding?

197
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:37,517
All anypony talks about is
Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that.

198
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,007
What about me?

199
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:42,548
How could everypony forget
about me so easily?

200
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:45,218
I mean, have I changed?

201
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,110
Same sleek body...

202
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,769
Same flowing mane...

203
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,814
Same spectacular hooves...

204
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:53,302
Nope! I'm still awesome.

205
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,074
They're wrong.

206
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:58,732
But... then why am I all alone?

207
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,716
I hate being all alone.

208
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:05,779
-Hey, Rainbow Dash!
-I knew it!

209
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:10,925
No need to apologize, squirt.
Anypony could make a mistake.

210
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:13,554
Mistake? What mistake?

211
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,113
Wait a minute. Why are you here?

212
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:18,682
To invite you to join us.

213
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:22,261
We're heading off to the thank you
parade for Ponyville's greatest hero:

214
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:23,683
Mare Do Well.

215
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:29,515
No! No way! Can't you see I...
I wanna be alone? I love being alone!

216
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:32,193
Oh. Okay. See you later, then.

217
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,170
Yeah, right. Like I'm gonna thank *her*.

218
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:38,730
Thank you, Mare Do Well,
whoever you are, for ruining e...

219
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:42,163
Hey, squirt! Wait up!

220
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:48,205
Welcome to Ponyville's first,
but surely not last...

221
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:53,508
...thank you parade in honor of our
city's greatest hero, the Mysterious...

222
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,360
...Mare Do Well!

223
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:04,454
The Mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?

224
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,515
So what are you hiding?

225
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:10,806
Let's see how mysterious
you are without that mask.

226
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,993
What a hay?

227
00:18:56,812 --> 00:18:58,563
I got you now!

228
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:03,919
All right, Miss Mysterious.

229
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,194
Mystery...

230
00:19:06,598 --> 00:19:07,816
...solved!

231
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:10,715
P-P-P-P-Pinkie?!

232
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,933
Twilight?!

233
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:25,706
Applejack?!

234
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:27,946
There were three of you?

235
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:31,172
Yep. We all played
Mare Do Well at different times.

236
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:33,749
I stopped the carriage bus
with these babies.

237
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,587
Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.

238
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:40,004
I saved the construction
workers with my Pinkie sense.

239
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,788
-Sorry.
-It's alright.

240
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,475
And I used my magic to fix the dam.

241
00:19:48,476 --> 00:19:51,772
Ooh! Ooh! And I did
the flyby afterwards.

242
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,644
I made the costumes.
Fabulous if I do say so myself.

243
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:59,056
I don't understand.

244
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,401
Why?!

245
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,528
Don't you want me to be a hero?

246
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:05,142
Of course we want you to be a hero.

247
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:07,775
But a real hero doesn't brag.

248
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:10,945
Uh, I guess I did start
to brag a little.

249
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,929
A LITTLE?!

250
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:16,109
Okay, a lot.

251
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,377
Celebrating your accomplishments
is natural, but...

252
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:22,480
Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.

253
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:26,828
Yeah! The only thing that should be rubbed
in anypony's face is chocolate cake.

254
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:34,153
I think we're gettin' off topic here.

255
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:38,206
What we're trying to say is it's great
to be really good at something...

256
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:41,241
...but it's important to act
with grace and humility.

257
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:47,140
Oh! That makes loads more sense!

258
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:49,673
Yeah. You're right.

259
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:54,260
And I guess I should also act with grace
and humility when others outshine me.

260
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,958
Like... Mare Do Well.

261
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,285
Sounds like you've got a letter
to write to Princess Celestia.

262
00:21:00,286 --> 00:21:01,804
Already got it covered.

263
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:04,843
As your ghostwriter, I've already
penned a letter to the princess.

264
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:09,291
That's nice of you, Spike, but I really
wanna write this letter myself.

265
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:13,115
Aw, come on! I wrote the whole thing already!

266
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:15,143
Okay. Let's hear it.

267
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,370
-"Dear Princess Cel..."
-Look out!

268
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:20,541
It's a real ghost!

269
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:36,432
