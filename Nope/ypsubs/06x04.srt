1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,771
<i>Hear ye, hear ye!</i>

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,000
The first post-cutie
mark meeting

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,340
of the Cutie Mark Crusaders
is now in session!

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,680
Ahem.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,660
Oh! I'm sorry Apple Bloom.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,220
I was distracted by the
radiance of my cutie mark.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,400
Did you say something?

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,960
I mean, it's pretty amazing
how the colors just pop off

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,060
your flank. It's kinda
hard to look awa-

10
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:38,137
Look. I know our cutie
marks are amazing.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,400
But is that all
we're gonna do now?

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,580
Just spend our days staring
down at our own flanks?

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,200
I guess not.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,500
Yeah. I suppose that
could get real boring.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Yeah.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,480
This is ridiculous! We need
to go out and do somethin'!

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,400
Wow. You're right!

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,360
Yeah! We need to go try
new stuff like we used to!

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,240
Exactly.

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,740
Like square dancing!

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,420
Or mountain climbing!

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,860
Or square dancing on the
mountain we just climbed!

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,020
Yeah!

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
And the more things we try,

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,580
the more chances we'll have to
finally get our cutie marks!

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,720
Come on!

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,900
Um... Apple Bloom?

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:54,520

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
<i>Wow. Did we</i>
<i> really only ever do things</i>

30
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,770
just to get our
cutie marks?

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,640
I don't know. Maybe?

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,420
Aw, come on. We
did lots of stuff

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,960
that didn't have anything to
do with getting a cutie mark.

34
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,120
Of course we did.

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,460
Absolutely.

36
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,200
Huh. So, now that we
don't have to do stuff

37
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,240
to get our cutie marks,

38
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,960
what is it that the Cutie
Mark Crusaders actually do?

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,380
We do exactly what we
got our cutie marks in.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,340
Helping other ponies!

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,360
Ponies without cutie marks!

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,740
Or ponies who've forgotten
their special purpose!

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,720
Exactly! We just
have to find ponies

44
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,540
who need our help.
Come on!

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,440
But are you sure
you feel content?

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,640
Eeyup.

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,040
Not even a tinge of
dissatisfaction?

48
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,000
Nope.

49
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,580
Not even the slightest
nagging sensation

50
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,700
that you don't really know
what your purpose is in life

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,260
or why you have a big
apple as a cutie mark?

52
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,460
Nope.

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,600
The important thing to remember

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,480
is that there is no rush.

55
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,240
The three of us tried
for the longest time,

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,720
but it just comes
when it comes.

57
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,220
And it's totally
normal to feel confused

58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,860
and maybe even
a little lost.

59
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,720
But being a blank flank is
nothing to be ashamed of.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,080
So if you're having even
the slightest problem...

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,230
Or concerns or questions...

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,260
We want you to know that
we are here to help!

63
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,680
I don't think they're too
worried about it yet.

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,540
This is gonna be a lot
harder than I thought.

65
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,740
Who knew there
were so few ponies

66
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,350
worried about
their cutie marks?

67
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,540
Kinda makes you wonder why
we made such a big deal

68
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,780
out of it for so long.

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,900
What?

70
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,440
The point is, helping ponies
with cutie mark problems

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,920
is what makes us special.

72
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,640
But if we can't find
anypony with a problem...

73
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,860
maybe we're not special.

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,700
YEAH!

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
I know exactly what you mean!

76
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,060
You can't find a
cutie mark problem.

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,220
I have a cutie mark
problem. It's so confusing

78
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,540
and I feel like
the solution

79
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,240
is staring me right
in the muzzle.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,540
What?

81
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,040
I see why you guys hang
out here. It's cozy!

82
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,920
The Crusader Clubhouse is a
safe place, Mr., um... Bulk.

83
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,060
A place where we've faced all
kinds of cutie mark problems.

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,640
A place where we'll go
on to solve even more,

85
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,460
starting with yours!

86
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,560
No matter how
long it takes.

87
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,900
Or how hard it is.

88
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,000
We'll solve it because
that's what we do!

89
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,040
Yeah!

90
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
YEAH!

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,750
So what's your
cutie mark problem?

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,660
Oh! Right! Uh, well, my
cutie mark is a dumb bell.

93
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,580
But I've lifted every
dumb bell in Ponyville!

94
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,020
Have you tried
lifting other things?

95
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,760
You mean, not
dumb bells?

96
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,840
Yeah.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,580
Yeah.

98
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,480
YEAH!

99
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,380
I mean, no. I hadn't
thought of that.

100
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,200
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!

101
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,840
But what happens when I
run out of other stuff?

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,520
I guess you could teach
other ponies to lift things.

103
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,860
Yeah!          Yeah.

104
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,600
YEAH! Wow. You three really
have a knack for this!

105
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,450
That was easy!

106
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,220
Maybe too easy.

107
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,380
What do you mean?

108
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,240
Well, it's looking like
cutie mark problems

109
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,720
are few and
far between.

110
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,120
And?

111
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,260
And what if we never
find another one?

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,720
Well...

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
And even if we do, we
could solve it so quick

114
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,260
it'll be like it never
happened in the first place.

115
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,660
So?

116
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,560
Sooo... then the
Cutie Mark Crusaders

117
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,820
don't have any
reason to exist!

118
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,300
The problem
boils down to this.

119
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,720
We don't need to go out
and do things anymore

120
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,020
to get our
cutie marks.

121
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,280
Right! And...

122
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,760
Ponies with Cutie Mark
problems are hard to find.

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,060
Exactly. But even
when we find problems,

124
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,980
we're so good at solving
them that most of the time

125
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,500
there's nothing for the
Cutie Mark Crusaders to do!

126
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,520
So, I thought we should
start figuring out ways

127
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,600
to search all of Equestria
for cutie mark problems!

128
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,940
That kinda seems
like a lot.

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
I don't think Rarity
would let me travel

130
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,340
to the far reaches
of Equestria

131
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,120
looking for cutie
mark problems.

132
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,800
Yeah. I'm sure we'll come
across them in Ponyville.

133
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,400
And when we do, we'll
totally solve them

134
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,440
because we are so
awesome at it!

135
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,280
Ha!

136
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,990
But what do we
do until then?

137
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,140
Maybe whatever
we want?

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,300
What do you mean?

139
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,220
Well, we used to only do
stuff to get our cutie marks

140
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,870
or fulfil our destiny,
but now we don't have to.

141
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,100
So, we can do
things just for fun?

142
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,740
Are you girls thinking
what I'm thinking?

143
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,880
Sure am!

144
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,680
Scooting!
Singing!
Making
potions!

145
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,640
Just remember: Stomp.
Kick. And roll.

146
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,720
After this, you two are gonna
love scootering as much as me.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,420
If you say so.

148
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,200
Ready? Stomp!

149
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,140
Kick!

150
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,760
AND ROLL!

151
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,360
Whoo!

152
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,580
<i> ♪ Ta-da! ♪</i>

153
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,240
I don't
think I did it right.

154
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,340
Doh...mi...soh

155
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,820
It's just a
simple harmony.

156
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,620
Harmony, huh?

157
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,870
And, ah-one and ah-two
and ah-one, two, three...

158
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
Wow. That was simple.

159
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,360
It's just a dash and
a drop and a drip.

160
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,680
Just a dash and a
drop and a drip.

161
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,980
And even though Scootaloo
thinks bungee jumping

162
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,160
is the bees knees,

163
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,860
Sweetie Belle would
rather keep bees.

164
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,000
Of course, I'm allergic.

165
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,080
Who'd have thought
it would be so hard

166
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,460
to find something for
us all to do together?

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,400
Well, I know this might sound
crazy, but what if we didn't?

168
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,520
Didn't what?

169
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,160
Do things together. Well,
do everything together.

170
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,400
But we're the Cutie
Mark Crusaders!

171
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,240
And we always will be, but
I really wanna bungee jump.

172
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,660
The speed! The height!
The fall!

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,860
And I know you two
aren't interested,

174
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,720
but I wanna try
crochet.

175
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,940
Isn't there something

176
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,540
you've always wanted
to do on your own?

177
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,620
I don't know.

178
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,400
I guess I figured we'd
always do stuff together.

179
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,940
But bungee jumping
sounds just as scary

180
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,540
as crochet
sounds boring.

181
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,940
That's OK. Sweetie Belle and
I can do the things we like

182
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,710
and you can do
whatever you like.

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,900
Just as soon as you
figure out what it is.

184
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,860
I guess.

185
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,840
Great! Then we
can meet back here

186
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,950
and talk all about
what we've done.

187
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,890
But I don't know
what it'll be.

188
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,520
You'll find something!

189
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,220
Something awesome!

190
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,660
Well, I
guess now I have to.

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,140
Two, two, three, four.

214
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,660
One, two, three four.
Two, two, three, four--

215
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,860
Whatever kind of
dancing y'all are doing,

216
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,700
you're doing it
together and I want in!

217
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,580
I-I mean uh,
would it be OK

218
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,560
if I enrolled in
this dance class?

219
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,680
Well, let's see
what you can do.

220
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,660
We have a recital
at Town Hall tonight

221
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
and a spot just
opened up.

222
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,300
Tender Taps is a little
too shy to perform,

223
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,360
but if you're ready to step
into a partnered routine...

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,720
That sounds an awful
lot like friendship

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,240
and I'm ready for anything I
don't have to do by myself.

226
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,640
Well, then, dancing with
partner will be perfect.

227
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,140
Whoaaaaaa!

228
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,580
Whoa. Whoaaaaa!

229
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,480
Whew. I feel like that
went pretty good but

230
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,100
let's give it one more whirl
because it's important

231
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
that I do a good
job partnering

232
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,140
with my new group
of friends.

233
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,960
Ehh. Now I'm think of it, you
might be better as soloist.

234
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,460
Ehh, partnering is a
little advanced for you,

235
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,860
but there's still lots
you can do on your own.

236
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,940
I'm sorry, but doing
stuff on my own

237
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,140
is exactly what
I don't want.

238
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,910
Sorry it didn't
work out.

239
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,640
Trying different things with
my friends was always fun,

240
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,640
even when we were terrible.
Now it's just terrible.

241
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,960
You weren't that bad; you just
need to learn a few things

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,460
on your own. Being a
soloist can be fun.

243
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,660
Ha!

244
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,620
You just have
to do it with feeling.

245
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,940
Thanks, but
without my friends,

246
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,200
I don't think I'll
ever feel again.

247
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,520
Good luck at
the recital.

248
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,700
Oh, I'm not going do
that. I mean, I want to.

249
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,950
It's kind of all
I think about.

250
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,960
I bet someday my cutie mark
will even be about performing,

251
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,080
but I could never dance
in front of an audience

252
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,380
the way I do in class.
That's t-t-terrifying.

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,560
Yeah. OK. Nice
meeting you.

254
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,880
You, too.

255
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,420
Sweetie Belle, you are
not going to believe this,

256
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,960
but I think I like
bungee jumping

257
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,620
even more than scootering!

258
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,220
Seriously? That's
amazing. Look what I did!

259
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,650
Wow. Uh. That's, um...

260
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,620
Horrible! But it was so much
fun. Rarity showed me how,

261
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,800
even though she says "crochet
is knitting's poorer cousin."

262
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,340
But I loved it.

263
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,480
Awesome!

264
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,120
Oh. Hello, girls. Have fun
pursuing your own interests?

265
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,680
Apple Bloom? What are you
doing sitting in the dark?

266
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,080
Yeah. We thought
you'd be out looking

267
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,250
for things you like to do.

268
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,540
Oh, I did. I
looked all over town.

269
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,620
I looked and I
looked and I looked

270
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,600
and you know what I found?

271
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,340
Nothing!

272
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,520
You tried every
one of these?

273
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,840
And each one just made me feel
more alone than the next.

274
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,960
I don't see how I'm
supposed to be happy

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,640
that we're not
hanging out anymore.

276
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,110
Wait. I never said that.

277
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,700
I just said we don't have
to do everything together.

278
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,740
Like when there's something
one of us wants to do

279
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,800
that the others don't.

280
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,580
Oh. Well, I guess
that changes things.

281
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,360
I can't believe
you thought

282
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,380
we didn't want to
hang out anymore.

283
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,580
I can't believe you
tried all this stuff

284
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,260
and didn't find one
thing you liked.

285
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,720
Well, I kind of
liked dancing.

286
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,660
Mainly because it
looked like something

287
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,900
you couldn't do alone, but
I wasn't very good at it.

288
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,740
You don't have to be good
at something to have fun.

289
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,420
And being good doesn't
always mean you will.

290
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,700
I know. I met the best
dancer in the world,

291
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,960
but he was so shy, he couldn't
bring himself to perform,

292
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,500
even though he really,
really wanted to.

293
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,020
I don't suppose this dancing
pony had a cutie mark, did he?

294
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,140
You're here!

295
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,600
SHHHHH!

296
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,920
What are you doing here?

297
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,370
You told me that you wanted to
perform more than anything,

298
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,180
but I was too caught
up in myself to listen.

299
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,560
You're the best
dancer I've ever seen

300
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,500
and I'm here to convince you
to get out on that stage!

301
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,120
Um, didn't I also
tell you

302
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,880
that dancing in front of other
ponies is t-t-terrifying?

303
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,580
I don't know if
you noticed...

304
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,160
...but that auditorium
is full of other ponies!

305
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,420
I can't go out there.
What if I'm bad?

306
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,200
We can go on together.

307
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,230
No matter what, you'll look
good dancing next to me.

308
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,960
All right.
I'll do it.

309
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,820
But I don't have my costume
and the backdrop is all wrong

310
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,260
and we don't have
time to change it!

311
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,660
Leave everything to us!

312
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,680
I don't know about this.

313
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,140
Don't worry. You'll
be just fine.

314
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,460
Here goes nothing!

315
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,360
You can't be any
worse than I was.

316
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,120
I can't believe it!

317
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,630
It's just what I always
imagined it would be!

318
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,260
And if it weren't for all of
you, I wouldn't even have it.

319
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,600
No problem. It's
what we do.

320
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,600
I only wish I'd realized
what you needed right away

321
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,240
instead of moping
around for no reason.

322
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,160
Well, either way, I
hope you keep dancing.

323
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,250
You know, I just might.

324
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,280
It sure is a lot of fun
and I'm pretty confident

325
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,420
I can only get better.

326
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,360
I'm sorry I was so silly about
us all doing our own things.

327
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,490
If we hadn't, I might have
never even tried dancing.

328
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,440
Or find out I
needed help.

329
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,300
With each of us going out and
trying things on our own,

330
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
we'll be three times as likely
to find ponies to help.

331
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,880
And trying new stuff
might even make us better

332
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,780
at helping them, like how
I used my bungee jumping

333
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,000
to change the sets.

334
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,240
Or my crochet to
make the costumes.

335
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
Well, one thing
is for sure:

336
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,460
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
will never be the same.

337
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,520
We'll be better!

338
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,740
YEAH!
