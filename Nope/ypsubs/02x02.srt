1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,660
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,300
I need you to wield the Elements
of Harmony once again and stop Discord.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,150
The Elements! They're gone!

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,730
Everypony has to play
or the game is over.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,660
And I win.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,110
Our friendship... over?

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,300
Who were you talking to?

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,220
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,120
What?

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,030
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,320
WHY? Need a good laugh?

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,260
What is happening to my friends?

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,830
Looks like we might be due
for a big old storm of chaos.

14
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,240
And what are YOU laughing at?!

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,210
You ponies are just
the most fun I've had in aeons.

16
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,390
Well, QUIT IT!!!

17
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,490
You better think
before you laugh at the Pink!

18
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,070
...kie Pie!

19
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,600
Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,020
Well, ha ha.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,020
Quit it!

22
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,020
No. Ha ha.

23
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,300
QUIT IT!!!

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,180
No. Ha ha ha ha ha.

25
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,360
Uh, Rarity?

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,930
This here diamond o' yours?

27
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,760
Twilight said we should split it
six way, since we uh...

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,690
...found it together.

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,640
Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine!

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,020
Girls, why are you
all acting like this?

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,480
We need to stick together!

32
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,550
It's just too entertaining.

33
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,280
Stop it, Discord!
You're not playing fair.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,110
I'm not playing fair?
Perhaps we haven't met.

35
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,660
I'm Discord. Spirit of chaos
and disharmony.

36
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,980
Hellooo!

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,360
How are we supposed to find
the Elements of Harmony...

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,440
...when you took away the labyrinth
before we could get to the end?!

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,970
Oh, wait! Did you...?

40
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,910
How funny!

41
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,810
You thought the Elements
were *in* the labyrinth?

42
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,330
Twists and turns are my master plan...

43
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,730
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

44
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,550
I never said they
were in the labyrinth.

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,040
But... But...

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,030
Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle.

47
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,100
♥ Maybe the magic of friendship ♥
can help you.

48
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,420
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some chaos to wreak.

49
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,920
Chocolate milk?! I hate chocolate milk!

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,330
Think, Twilight, think!

51
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,830
Find the Elements
back where you began...

52
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,600
Back where you began...

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,110
Don't touch my gem!

54
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,030
I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha ha.

55
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,380
What's you laughing at?!

56
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,930
Ugh, I just wanna go home.

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,170
Wait a minute...

58
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,450
Home! Back where you began!

59
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,180
The Elements must be in...

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,900
...Ponyville!

61
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,860
Come on, girls! I'm certain this is
what Discord's riddle really meant.

62
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,560
If we get back to the library...

63
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,150
...I have a book that I just know
can give us a clue.

64
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,160
Good boy, Angel! Mama's so proud.

65
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,720
Weeell, I can see so much better now.

66
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,630
I meant to do that.

67
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,000
Discord's turned our
dirt roads into soap!

68
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,230
Beautiful, isn't it?

69
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,910
This is the new and improved Ponyville.

70
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,090
And these are only my first changes.

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,120
This may look like fun, but it's not.

72
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,400
Picture it, the chaos
capital of the world.

73
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,830
I can't picture anything.
It's too dark.

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,380
Well, wait a few minutes and you'll
see it in the beautiful light of day.

75
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,440
Or not.

76
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,080
Ponyville the chaos
capital of the world?

77
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,530
Not if I have anything to say about it.

78
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,630
Don't worry. You won't.

79
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,280
Okay, we're here. Everyone please
please please just go inside, please?

80
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,320
I absolutely refuse.

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,000
With pleasure.

82
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,940
I hate libraries.

83
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,660
Pleeease, we gotta hurry!

84
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,530
Forget it, Twilight.
I know what you're up to.

85
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,800
The second I go in you'll have your
little minion Spike come and take Tom.

86
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,790
-Tom?
-Well, it's not going to work!

87
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,590
You're not going in
without him, are you?

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,200
Fine!

89
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,140
What'd you do that for, Fluttershy?

90
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,220
Cause you just look so peaceful.

91
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,390
I, uh...

92
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,460
Careful, Twilight!

93
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,540
You'll ruin his beautiful finish.

94
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,930
Oh, for the love of...

95
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,390
Twilight, what's going on?

96
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,010
Why's everybody look so...

97
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,140
...gray?

98
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,720
Don't ask. I need you
to help me find something.

99
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,140
Hey, Twilight? What's
soaking wet and clueless?

100
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,550
Fluttershy, I've had just about enou...

101
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,610
Your face!

102
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,950
What's happened to everypony?

103
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,500
I guess you just bring up
the worst in us, Spike.

104
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,600
No time to explain.

105
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,920
We've got to find the reference guide
to Elements of Harmony...

106
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,830
...before somepony does
something she'll regret!

107
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,900
The Elements of Harmony?

108
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,090
Oh! I know exactly where that book is!

109
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,870
Found it!

110
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,560
Ha!

111
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,150
Fluttershy... You better
give me that book!

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,070
Keep away!

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,310
Hey!

114
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,850
Applejack! Give me that book!

115
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,290
I don't have any book.

116
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,780
Pinkie!

117
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,900
You guys!

118
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,830
Stop it right now!

119
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,400
Mine!

120
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,690
Hey! Do you even know
what you just stole?

121
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,060
No, but if you want it, I want it.

122
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,810
GIVE ME THAT BOOK!!!

123
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,410
Where is she? Where is Rarity?

124
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,350
Beats me.

125
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,720
Lies!

126
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,410
Get back! All of you!

127
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,280
This is my book! AND I'M GONNA READ IT!

128
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,470
The Elements!

129
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,890
The Elements!

130
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,880
They were here all along!

131
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,780
This is great!

132
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,780
Now you guys can defeat Discord
and put everything back to normal.

133
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,500
See, girls? We did it! We've found
the Elements of Harmony!

134
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,900
Together!

135
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,280
You don't even care, do you?

136
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,240
No.

137
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,180
I never thought it would
happen. My friends...

138
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,700
...have turned into complete jerks!

139
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,160
Necklace... Necklace...
Necklace... Necklace...

140
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,110
Aaand...

141
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,270
...big crown-thingy.
Come on, everypony! Let's go!

142
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,910
But, Twilight.
Aren't you missing somepony?

143
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,250
Nope. We've got the liar, the grump,
the hoarded and the brute.

144
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,300
That just about covers it.

145
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,240
What about Rainbow Dash?

146
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,710
Congratulations, Spike. You're
the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!

147
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,230
Me?!

148
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,110
B-b-but... what if she finds out
I've been impersonating her?

149
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,140
That won't end well.

150
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,890
Too bad. You're Rainbow Dash.

151
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,310
Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't
ever have to talk to each other again.

152
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,900
YEAH! WOOHOO!

153
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,070
Move!

154
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,560
Look out! Here comes Tom!

155
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,130
Well, well, well. I see you've
found the Elements of Harmony.

156
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,360
How terrifying!

157
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,230
Discord! I've figured out
your lame riddle.

158
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,930
You're in for it now!

159
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,260
I certainly am. You've
clearly outduelled me.

160
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,770
And now it's time to meet my fate.

161
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,960
I'm prepared to be
defeated now, ladies.

162
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,510
Fire when ready.

163
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,610
Formation! Now!

164
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,550
Rainbow Dash! Get over here!

165
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,180
All right. Let's get this over with.

166
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,680
What's going on?

167
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,600
Mine's workin'. There must be
somethin' wrong with yours.

168
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,050
I hate the Elements of Harmony!

169
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,770
Garbage.

170
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,640
MINE!

171
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,620
Sorry, Twilight. I guess I better get
back upstairs and clean up the library.

172
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,560
Good luck with all this... whoa!

173
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,830
Oops. Sorry, Rainbow Crash.

174
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,090
Bravo, ponies! Bravo!

175
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,560
Harmony in Equestria
is officially dead.

176
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,330
Discord rules, Celestia drools.

177
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,950
It's your fault it didn't work!

178
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,380
Who are you talking to?

179
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,430
Any of you! All of you!

180
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,710
I'm outta here!

181
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,240
I better go too. I got new, better
friends waitin' for me at the farm.

182
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,250
Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.

183
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,010
Fine! Leave! See if I care.

184
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,920
I don't need you guys either.

185
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,380
With friends like you, who needs...

186
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,760
...enemies.

187
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,790
My stomach!

188
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,760
Twilight, you've got to
see what I just did.

189
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,690
It's priceless!

190
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,190
Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've
got to get into the spirit of things.

191
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,700
After all, this is your new home.

192
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,950
Not anymore.

193
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,620
YES!

194
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,630
Pack your things, Spike. We're leaving.

195
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,960
And don't ask where we're going,
'cause... I don't know yet.

196
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,420
Just not here.

197
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,590
Can't... move!

198
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,240
The Princess...
has been sending these...

199
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,220
...since I came back upstairs.

200
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,530
Make it stop!

201
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,540
These are all the letters
I've written to the Princess...

202
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,510
...since I've lived in Ponyville.

203
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,070
But why would she send them back?

204
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,540
"Real friends don't care
what your cover is..."

205
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,970
"Friendship is a wondrous
and powerful thing..."

206
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,710
"And like the path cut through the orchard,
there'll be always a way through."

207
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,260
"The best thing to do is
to stay true to yourself..."

208
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,620
"...special magical connection
with her friends..."

209
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,810
"...maybe even before she's met them."

210
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,070
Spike! Spike, it's all so clear!

211
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,840
Can't you see? Discord's trying to
distract us from what's important.

212
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,290
He knows how powerful
our friendships are...

213
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,590
...and he's trying to
keep us from seeing it.

214
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,410
Do you remember what I said
the first day we arrived in Ponyville?

215
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,240
I told you that the future of Equestria
didn't rest on me making friends.

216
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,140
But the opposite is true!

217
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,910
The friendships I've made
since I've been here...

218
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,970
...would save Equestria
from Nightmare Moon.

219
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,830
And now they need to
save it from Discord!

220
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,990
You're right, Spike.

221
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,040
I've got to fight for my friendships.

222
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,040
For them. For me. For Equestria!

223
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,330
Oh. Uh...

224
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,940
Why don't you just stay here and rest?

225
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,190
I'll take care of the whole fighting
for friendship thing myself.

226
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,830
And so I tried to defeat Discord...

227
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,890
...but none of my so-called friends
would lift a hoof to help me.

228
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,460
Applejack! I'm here to fight
for our friendship.

229
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,840
Oh. Now you wanna fight.

230
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,220
Where were you when
I was battlin' Discord?

231
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,240
Snap out of it!

232
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,060
This isn't you!

233
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,630
You're not a liar.

234
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,110
Wha... What happened?

235
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,460
Twilight!

236
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,670
I saw a vision of us
feudin' and fightin'.

237
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,100
I couldn't face the truth
so I started tellin' lies.

238
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,920
Can you ever forgive me?

239
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,530
I already have.

240
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,650
Come on!

241
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,060
Oh no!

242
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,770
Twilight! Applejack!
I just had the worst dream!

243
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,760
What do you think you're doing?
Get away from my gem! Get Away!

244
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,990
Let us never speak of this again.

245
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,910
Oh, and I... I turned gray!

246
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,160
Can you believe it?

247
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,300
She's not here.

248
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,140
Without Rainbow Dash
we can't use the Elements.

249
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,530
She could be anywhere by now.
We're never gonna find her.

250
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,670
Yeah, we will. Cause she's right there.

251
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,180
Rainbow Dash!

252
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,320
Hey, guys!

253
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,490
We've been looking everywhere for you.

254
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,830
That's nice.

255
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,600
Discord's still on the loose.

256
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,010
We need you to help us defeat him
with your element: loyalty.

257
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,390
Loyalty-schmoyalty.

258
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,650
Have you guys seen Ponyville?
It's a disaster!

259
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,230
I'm staying here in Cloudsdale
where everything is awesome.

260
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,830
How in Equestria could she think that
tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?

261
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,350
The same way he got you to think that
cheap rock was a bona fide diamond?

262
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,410
I thought we agreed
never to speak of it again.

263
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,270
Time for Plan B.

264
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,260
Okay, Fluttershy.

265
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,320
You grab Rainbow Dash
and hold her down.

266
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,280
Applejack will lower me
down from this rope...

267
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,120
...so I can cast
the memory spell on her.

268
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,270
Got it!

269
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,580
Um... I'm just wondering
if it's okay...

270
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,970
...if I hold you down
against your will for a little bit?

271
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,660
Nice try. Ponyville's
your problem, not mine.

272
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,270
Come on, Fluttershy!
We've gotta catch her.

273
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,640
Applejack!

274
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,170
PinkiIEEE! You were supposed
to secure the roOOPE!

275
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,270
Oops.

276
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,580
Rarity! Pinkie! Hold on!
Y'all are slowin' 'er down!

277
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,580
Oh, Fluttershy. Would you
be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?

278
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,850
I can't!

279
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,630
If you can't catch her, Discord wins!

280
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,010
That... big... dumb... MEANIE!!!

281
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,340
Okay, Applejack! Last rope!
Make it count!

282
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,750
Lemme go! I don't need you guys!

283
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,070
Leave me alone!

284
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,680
Wha... What happened?

285
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,220
How's Ponyville?!
Where are the Elements?!

286
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,120
Did we stop Discord?

287
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,290
Maybe it's a little early
for a group hug.

288
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,310
Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.

289
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,260
Not as wonderful...

290
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,280
...as friendship!

291
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,320
This again?

292
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,560
That's right! You couldn't break apart
our friendship for long.

293
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,980
Oh, Applejack. Don't lie to me.

294
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,890
I'm the one who made you a liar.

295
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,870
Will you ever learn?

296
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,070
I'll tell you what
we've learned, Discord.

297
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,010
We've learned that
friendship isn't always easy...

298
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,760
...but there's no doubt
it's worth fighting for.

299
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,540
Ugh, gag.

300
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,280
Fine. Go ahead.
Try and use your little Elements.

301
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,620
"Friend me". Just make it quick.

302
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,960
I'm missing some excellent chaos here.

303
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,780
All right, ladies! Let's show him
what friendship can do!

304
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,990
Wait, wait, wait!

305
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,850
What's this?

306
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,420
No...

307
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,490
Nooo!!!

308
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,000
We are gathered here today...

309
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,350
...to once again honor
the heroism of these six friends...

310
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,440
...who stood up
to the villain Discord...

311
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,150
...and saved Equestria
from eternal chaos.

312
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,060
