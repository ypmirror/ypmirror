1
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:14,300
It is gorgeous out.
Just gorgeous!

2
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:25,565
Twilight! I... have...

3
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:27,553
lemme just...

4
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:34,314
Dear Twilight,

5
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:38,612
I am sure you are as excited as I am
about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot.

6
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:40,209
Wedding?!

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,052
I will be presiding over the ceremony,
but would very much like you and your friends

8
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:46,582
to help with the preparations
for this wonderful occasion.

9
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:50,344
Fluttershy, I would like you and your
songbird choir to provide the music.

10
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:52,819
Oh my goodness! What an honor!

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,236
Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more
qualified than you to host the reception.

12
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:02,902
Applejack, you will be in charge
of the catering for the reception.

13
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,456
Well, color me pleased as punch!

14
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,252
Rainbow Dash, I would very much
appreciate it if you could perform

15
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,552
a sonic rainboom as the bride
and groom complete their I do's.

16
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:13,703
Yes!

17
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:16,952
Rarity, you will be responsible
for designing the dresses

18
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,853
for the bride and her bridesmaids.

19
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:21,432
Princess Celestia wants me to...

20
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:23,762
...wedding dress?

21
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:26,289
For a Canterlot wedding...

22
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:33,563
And as for you, Twilight, you will be
playing the most important role of all:

23
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:35,892
making sure that everything
goes as planned.

24
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,455
See you all very soon.
Yours, Princess Celestia.

25
00:01:41,412 --> 00:01:44,646
But... I don't understand.
Who's getting married?

26
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:45,704
Oh, wait!

27
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:49,408
I was probably supposed
to give you this one first.

28
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,996
Princess Celestia cordially
invites you to the wedding of

29
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,686
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza,
and...

30
00:01:55,837 --> 00:01:57,632
my brother?!

31
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:06,146

Your brother's getting married?

35
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,261
Congratulations, Twilight,
that's great news!

36
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,119
Yeah, great news... that I just got
from a wedding invitation!

37
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,319
Not from my brother,
but from a piece of paper!

38
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,270
Thanks a lot, Shining Armor.

39
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,798
I mean, really,
he couldn't tell me personally?

40
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:56,733
<i>Hey, Twilight,
just thought you should know...</i>

41
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:59,232
<i>I'm making a really big decision
that changes everything.</i>

42
00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:02,500
<i>Oh, nevermind, you'll hear about it
when you get the invitation.</i>

43
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,774
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza?
Who in the hoof is that?!

44
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:10,642
Twilight? Are you okay?

45
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:14,619
Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor
and I have always been so close.

46
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,169
He's my B.B.B.F.F!

47
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:20,872
Big Brother Best Friend Forever?

48
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,229
Before I came here and learned
the importance of friendship,

49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,939
Shining Armor was the only pony
I ever really accepted as a friend.

50
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:38,477
<i>When I was just a filly,
I found it rather silly</i>

51
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:43,064
<i>To see how many other ponies I could meet</i>

52
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:47,496
<i>I had my books to read,
didn't know that I would ever need</i>

53
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:51,687
<i>Other ponies to make my life complete</i>

54
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:54,599
<i>But there was one colt that I cared for</i>

55
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,665
<i>I knew he would be there for me</i>

56
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:02,709
<i>My big brother,
best friend forever</i>

57
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:08,171
<i>Like two peas in a pod,
we did everything together</i>

58
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,127
<i>He taught me how to fly a kite</i>

59
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:13,259
<i>He taught me how to fly a kite
(Best friend forever)</i>

60
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:15,901
<i>We never had a single fight</i>

61
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:17,949
<i>We never had a single fight
(We did everything together)</i>

62
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,132
<i>We shared our hopes,
we shared our dreams</i>

63
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:25,933
<i>I miss him more than I realized</i>

64
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:28,047
<i>It seems...</i>

65
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:32,513
<i>Your big brother,
best friend forever</i>

66
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:37,678
<i>Like two peas in a pod,
you did everything together</i>

67
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,819
<i>And though he's so far away,
I hoped that he would stay</i>

68
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,450
<i>My Big Brother Best Friend</i>

69
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:52,939
<i>Forever</i>

70
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:58,288
<i>Forever...</i>

71
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:05,819
As one of your PFFs...

72
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,544
Pony Friends Forever...

73
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:14,322
I wanna tell you that I think your
brother sounds like a real good guy.

74
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,528
He is pretty special.

75
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:19,630
I mean, they don't let just anypony
be Captain of the Royal Guard.

76
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:22,444
So let me get this straight.

77
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:25,219
We're helping out with the
wedding of not only a princess,

78
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,057
but a Captain of the Royal Guard?

79
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,322
I guess we are.

80
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,572
A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?!
Can you say "best wedding ever"!

81
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,718
Best wedding ever!

82
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:52,019
So you all get to help with
the big fancy wedding,

83
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,808
but I'm the one who gets
to host the bachelor party!

84
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,255
I have just one question,
what's a bachelor party?

85
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,407
Why the long face, sugarcube?

86
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,647
I'm just thinking about Shining Armor.

87
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:10,089
Ever since I moved to Ponyville,
we've been seeing each other less and less.

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,653
And now that he's starting
a new family with this...

89
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:17,339
"Princess Mi Amore Cal-whatshername",
we'll probably never see each other.

90
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,513
Come on, now. You're his sister.

91
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:22,444
He'll always make time for you.

92
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:25,390
Couldn't seem to make time
to tell me he was getting married.

93
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,536
What's with all the guards?

94
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:49,231
I'm sure they're just taking
the necessary precautions.

95
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:52,404
Royal weddings do bring out
the strangest ponies.

96
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:58,149
Now let's get going,
we've got work to do!

97
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,338
And you've got a big brother
to go congratulate.

98
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,023
Yeah. Congratulate.

99
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:06,387
And then give him a piece of my mind.

100
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,596
I've got something
to say to you, mister.

101
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,261
Twilie!

102
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,515
I've missed, you, kid.
How was the train ride, I-

103
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,708
How dare you not tell me in person
that you were getting married!

104
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,381
I'm your sister, for pony's sake!

105
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,881
It's not my fault!

106
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:39,671
Princess Celestia has requested
a major increase in security.

107
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:41,496
Didn't you see all the guards
at the train station?

108
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:43,681
Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up.

109
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:45,232
Maybe you heard about it?

110
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:47,214
It has nothing to do
with the wedding.

111
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:49,978
A threat has been made
against Canterlot.

112
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:54,053
We don't know who's responsible for it,
but Princess Celestia asked that

113
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:55,981
I help provide additional protection.

114
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,701
This, you need to see.

115
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:20,081
The burden of keeping Canterlot safe
and secure rests squarely on my shoulders.

116
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:24,008
Staying focused on the task at hand
has been my top priority.

117
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,208
Okay, okay, I get it.

118
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,885
You've got a really important job
protecting all of Canterlot

119
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:34,309
with a force field only you
can conjure up.

120
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,330
But still... how could you not tell me
about something as big as your wedding?

121
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:41,779
Am I not that important
to you any more?

122
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,481
Hey. You're my little sister.

123
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,211
Of course you're important to me.

124
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:51,049
But I'd understand if you didn't
want to be my best mare now.

125
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:54,681
You want me to be your best mare?

126
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:56,836
Well... yeah.

127
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,387
I'd be honored!

128
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,590
But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying
somepony I don't even know!

129
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:06,142
When did you even meet this
"Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"?

130
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:10,205
Twilie, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza
is Cadance.

131
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:11,656
Your old foalsitter.

132
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:14,391
Cadance? As in the Cadance?

133
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:17,681
As in the greatest foalsitter
in all the history of foalsitters?!

134
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:20,391
You tell me, she was your foalsitter.

135
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,666
Ohmygoshohmygosh!

136
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:25,609
<i>Cadance is only the
most amazing pony ever!</i>

137
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,103
<i>She's beautiful, she's caring,
she's kind...</i>

138
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:34,356
I am so lucky to have you
as my foalsitter!

139
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,784
I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight.

140
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:39,529
You're a princess.

141
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,818
I'm just a regular old unicorn.

142
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:45,717
You are anything but
a regular old unicorn.

143
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:51,981
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake,
clap your hooves and do a little shake!

144
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:57,212
I am going for a hooficure
and that is that!

145
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,795
- You are not going.
- I am. I am...

146
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:10,735
<i>How many unicorns can just
spread love wherever they go?</i>

147
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,699
<i>I only know of one!</i>

148
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,936
And you're marrying her!

149
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:19,264
You're marrying Cadance,
you're marrying Cadance!

150
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:22,482
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

151
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,647
Cadance!

152
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:28,934
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake,
clap your hooves and do a little shake!

153
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:30,285
What are you doing?

154
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,604
Cadance, it's me, Twilight!

155
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:41,170
I've gotta get back to my station.

156
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:44,450
But Cadance will be checking in with
all of you to see how things are going.

157
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:49,604
I think I speak for both of us when I say
we couldn't be more excited to have you here.

158
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:50,955
Right, dear?

159
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:53,284
Absolutely.

160
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:56,381
Well, we'll let you get to it.

161
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,790
Cake, check.

162
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:11,877
Ice sculpture, check.

163
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,323
Best darn bitesize apple fritter
you ever tasted...

164
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:19,215
Check.

165
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:21,816
<i>I do. Do you?</i>

166
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:22,967
<i>I do!</i>

167
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:28,809
Hiya, Princess!

168
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,808
Please, call me
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.

169
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,530
Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.

170
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:38,149
You come to check out what's
on the menu for your big day?

171
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,561
I have!

172
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:50,158
Delicious! I love, love, love them.

173
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,415
Aw, shucks. Why don't
you take a few to go?

174
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,538
I know how you brides can be.

175
00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:00,687
So busy, you forget to get
a little somethin' in your belly.

176
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,913
Did... you see what she...

177
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:15,679
Oh, you should have seen
how she acted back there.

178
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,136
I don't know when she changed,
but she changed!

179
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:21,827
<i>"Please, call me
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."</i>

180
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,876
Did I hear someone say my name?

181
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:24,827
Your highness!

182
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,571
Let me just start by saying
what an honor it is to play a role

183
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:29,861
in such a momentous occasion.

184
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:34,152
Is my dress ready?

185
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,181
Yes, of course.

186
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:39,457
I've been working on it ever since
I was given the assignment.

187
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:43,033
And I think you'll be pleased
with the results!

188
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:47,866
I was hoping for something with
more beading and a longer train.

189
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:49,881
Yes, of course.

190
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,955
And those should be a different color.

191
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:54,581
I think they're lovely.

192
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,732
Me too.

193
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:56,983
I love them.

194
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:00,368
Make them a different color.

195
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,624
Gee, maybe her name should be
"Princess Demandy-pants."

196
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:12,946
Okay, let me see.

197
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,497
We've been over the games...

198
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:19,145
The dances...

199
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:25,009
I think this reception is gonna
be perfect! Don't you?

200
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,581
Perfect!

201
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:29,437
...if we were celebrating
a six-year-old's birthday party.

202
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:31,828
Thank you!

203
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,469
Rest, my sister.

204
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,747
As always, I will guard the night.

205
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,801
Bet I can guess what
you're all thinking!

206
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:50,568
Cadance is the absolute
worst bride-to-be ever.

207
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,086
<i>Who, me?</i>

208
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:55,334
Spike! That goes on the cake.

209
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,637
Twilight, whatever are you talking about?

210
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,626
Cadance is an absolute gem!

211
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:04,400
Rarity, she was so demanding!

212
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:05,690
Well of course she was!

213
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:08,161
Why shouldn't she expect
the very best on her wedding day?

214
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:12,862
Applejack, did you know that after she told
you how much she just 'love-love-loved'

215
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:14,850
your hors-d'oeuvres,
she threw them in the trash?

216
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,981
Aw, she was probably just
trying to spare my feelings.

217
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:22,150
No, she was just being fake,
and totally insincere!

218
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,353
She did raise her voice at one of
my birds during rehearsal.

219
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:28,704
See? Rude!

220
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:32,504
But... he was singing really off-key.

221
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:38,577
Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed
how Cadance treated-

222
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:44,303
Nevermind.

223
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:46,229
Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?

224
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,324
Sorry Twi, been too busy prepping
for my sonic rainboom

225
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:53,290
to pay much attention to
the bride's bad attitude.

226
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:56,331
The princess is about to get married.

227
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,631
I'm sure any negative behavior
she might be displaying

228
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:00,485
is simply the result of nerves.

229
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:04,319
And I'm sure it's the result
of being an awful pony

230
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,540
who doesn't deserve to even know
Shining Armor let alone marry him!

231
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:12,430
Think maybe you're being just a tiny bit
possessive of your brother?

232
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,340
I am not being possessive!

233
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,917
And I am not taking it out on Cadance!

234
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:19,679
You're all just too caught up
in your wedding planning

235
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,202
to notice that maybe there
shouldn't even be a wedding!

236
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,459
Twilie!

237
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,434
Your big brother's looking
pretty good, don't you think?

238
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,306
Everything okay?

239
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:43,657
We need to talk.

240
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:45,008
I think you're making a big-

241
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,196
Oh, hi, sweetie.

242
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,734
She sure has a way
of sneaking up on people.

243
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:53,757
Could I speak to you for a moment,
dear?

244
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:56,377
Better see what she wants.

245
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,876
Look, we need to talk.

246
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,027
I'm here to talk.

247
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,063
- Look, she's okay-
- Just listen to me.

248
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,414
I'm listening, I'm listening...

249
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,870
I thought I made it perfectly clear
I didn't want you to wear that.

250
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,034
This was my favorite uncle's.

251
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:12,059
And...?

252
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,970
And I think I should wear it.

253
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:15,814
Are you disagreeing with me?

254
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,125
I guess I am!

255
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,520
Oh dear, are you getting
another one of your headaches?

256
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:29,454
Feeling better?

257
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:35,809
She isn't just unpleasant and rude,
she's downright evil!

258
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,116
Twilight!

259
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:43,352
Let her go.

260
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:46,924
It seemed like she had something else
she wanted to tell me.

261
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,082
Who goes there?

262
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,686
Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle.

263
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,060
Shining Armor's in real trouble!
You have to help-

264
00:16:58,654 --> 00:16:59,889
Dresses?

265
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:01,244
What are you...?

266
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:03,264
Can you believe it?

267
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:07,464
We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore
Cadenza's new bridesmaids!

268
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:09,027
"New" bridesmaids?

269
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,384
What happened to her "old" bridesmaids?!

270
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:12,535
She didn't say.

271
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:16,458
But she did tell us that she would
love love love it if we'd fill in for them.

272
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,555
Seeing as we've been working
so hard and everything.

273
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,939
And you had your doubts about her.

274
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,520
Told you she was an absolute gem!

275
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:24,162
You sure this is what I should wear?

276
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:28,177
Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.

277
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,061
I'll see what I can do.

278
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:31,637
This is so exciting!

279
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:33,329
I know! This is awesome!

280
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,408
Looks like I really am on my own.

281
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:46,083
Perfect, girls. No need to rush!

282
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,828
Then of course, Cadance will enter.

283
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:02,725
I'll say a few words,
and then we'll begin with the vows.

284
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,803
Shining Armor, you'll get
the ring from your Best Mare.

285
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:08,898
Do you?

286
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,249
I do!

287
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,239
Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?

288
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,147
I'm here!

289
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,595
I'm not gonna stand next to her.

290
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:20,102
And neither should you!

291
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:25,367
I'm sorry, I don't know
why she's acting like this.

292
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,264
Maybe we should just ignore her.

293
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,304
You have to listen to me!

294
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:32,375
Oh goodness! Are you okay?

295
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:33,526
I'm fine.

296
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:34,677
Ya sure about that?

297
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:37,150
I've got something to say!

298
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,291
She's evil!

299
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:47,100
She's been horrible to my friends...

300
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:50,270
She's obviously done something
to her bridesmaids...

301
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:52,085
And if that wasn't enough,

302
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:55,393
I saw her put a spell on my brother
that made his eyes go all...!

303
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,745
Why are you doing this to me?!

304
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,460
Because you're evil!

305
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:12,568
Evil! And if I don't stop you,
you're gonna ruin my brother's life!

306
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:23,158
You want to know why my eyes went all...?

307
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,725
Because ever since I started having
to perform my protection spell,

308
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,879
I've been getting terrible migraines.

309
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,083
Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me,
she's been using her magic to heal me!

310
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:38,046
And she decided to
replace her bridesmaids

311
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:41,290
because she found out the only reason
they wanted to be in the wedding

312
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,384
was so that they could
meet Canterlot royalty!

313
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:45,924
And if she hasn't been on her
best behavior with your friends,

314
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:49,271
it's because with me being so busy,
she's had to make all the decisions

315
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,422
about the wedding!

316
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:51,673
I was just trying to-

317
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,211
She's completely stressed out
because it's really important to her

318
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:55,962
that her big day be perfect!

319
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,739
Something that obviously
wasn't important to you.

320
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,928
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go and comfort my bride.

321
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:10,124
And you can forget about
being my best mare.

322
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,738
In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't
show up to the wedding at all.

323
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,465
C'mon, y'all.
Let's go check on the princess.

324
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:31,291
- I was...
- You have a lot to think about.

325
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:37,216
Maybe I was being overprotective.

326
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,638
I could've gained a sister.

327
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:44,231
But instead... I just lost a brother.

328
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:50,042
<i>He was my Big Brother,
Best Friend</i>

329
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:54,130
<i>Forever...</i>

330
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:59,434
<i>And now, we'll never do anything</i>

331
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,809
<i>Together...</i>

332
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:13,057
I'm sorry!

333
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,566
You will be.
