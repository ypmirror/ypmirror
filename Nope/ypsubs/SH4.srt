1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,780
Just remember, the most important thing
about sugar butter cocoa cookies

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,700
is to fold your batter.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,870
Too much arm turnin'll make your cookies
tougher than a lump of coal.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,120
Come on, Pinkie. You're s'posed to
help me find a drummer for my band.

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,420
I guess I could fold a little faster.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,590
Most people don't know
how hard it is to find

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,510
someone who could use both hands
the way a drummer does.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,880
I'll bet!

9
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,890
Now, it's important that
our banner look awesome!

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,690
So feel free to use
as much glitter as you want.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,400
- A drummer can't just be anybody.
- Oh, of course not.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,530
They need to have
the right instincts, you know?

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,780
Totally!

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,250
It's gotta be someone with a lot of...

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,050
- ...energy.
- Absolutely!

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,060
I mean, a lot!
Energy, enthusiasm...

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,770
- Pinkie!
- Whaaaaaaat?!

18
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,440
They have to be able to carry
the whole band on their shoulders!

19
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,950
Pinkie!

20
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,290
We've got to find
an outlet for all that energy!

21
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,100
What ever made you think of
Pinkie for the drums?

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,520
I dunno.
Guess I just have a sense for these things.
