00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,571
Calling all pegasus ponies!
Meeting tonight!

2
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:18,124
Mandatory meeting
for all Ponyville pegasi.

3
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:22,321
Library, tonight.
Be cool, or be mule.

4
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:24,422
No offense.

5
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:26,000
None taken.

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,901
Alright, go on in, find a seat.

7
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,186
You too, Fluttershy.

8
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:45,924
Come on, let's go.

00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:55,457

12
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:35,031
<i>Every living thing depends on
the life-giving nourishment of rainwater.</i>

13
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:38,681
<i>And it is up to Cloudsdale
to provide rain-filled clouds</i>

14
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,042
<i>to every corner of Equestria.</i>

15
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:45,914
<i>But how, one pony might ask,
does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water?</i>

16
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:48,558
<i>Tornado power!</i>

17
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,100
<i>That's right, pegasi-driven tornado power.</i>

18
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:56,935
<i>A team of pegasi combine their wing power
to create a jumbo tornado,</i>

19
00:01:57,086 --> 00:02:00,241
<i>powerful enough to pull water
out of the local reservoir,</i>

20
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:03,381
<i>and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale.</i>

21
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:06,421
<i>Remember, pegasi,
your jumbo tornado</i>

22
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:09,666
<i>must reach a minimum of
eight hundred wing power</i>

23
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:12,137
<i>to lift that water up to Cloudsdale.</i>

24
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:15,341
<i>So, the next time you're wondering</i>

25
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:17,666
<i>"Where does all that extra
rainwater come from?"</i>

26
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:19,281
<i>just rememb-</i>

27
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,105
Uh... intermission?

28
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,656
So, here's the scoop.

29
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:31,547
Cloudsdale has chosen
our own highland reservoir

30
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:34,393
as a source of the rainwater
they need for all of Equestria.

31
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:36,144
And you know what that means.

32
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:40,081
It means it's up to Ponyville's pegasi
to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.

33
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:45,081
Not only that, but Spitfire,
captain of the Wonderbolts,

34
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,813
will be here to oversee the water transfer
and record our top tornado windspeed.

35
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:51,631
Now last year, Fillydelphia
broke the windspeed record

36
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:54,341
with a top speed of
nine hundred and ten wing power.

37
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:56,177
But I think we can do better.

38
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:59,411
I think we can get a top speed
over a thousand!

39
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:05,281
IF each and every pony trains,
and trains hard

40
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:07,363
to get their wing power numbers up.

41
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:11,928
That coughing better be from
a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane.

42
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,911
Nopony's getting sick on my watch.

43
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:16,461
So, are we gonna train hard?

44
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:17,512
Yeah!

45
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,531
Are we gonna be strong?

46
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:20,682
Yeah!

47
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,333
Are we gonna be fast?

48
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:23,884
Yeah!

49
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:26,165
Record-smashing fast?

50
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,266
Yeah!

51
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:30,101
Who's with me?

52
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,624
Fluttershy!

53
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:43,531
Stretch those glutes, Flitter!

54
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,821
Nice flexibility, Cloudchaser.

55
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:48,434
A little too much flexibility,
Blossomforth.

56
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:50,820
Somepony give Blossomforth a hoof.

57
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,302
Let's see some faster trotting,
Thunderlane!

58
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:55,965
Good pace, Silverspeed!

59
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:58,781
Keep it up!

60
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:01,926
We're gonna need all the wing power
we can get to break that record!

61
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:03,377
Yeah!

62
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:06,545
Good work, everypony!

63
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,008
Everypony except Fluttershy.

64
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:14,851
Fluttershy? I know you're in there!

65
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,511
You're avoiding tornado duty
and I want to know why!

66
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:19,062
Fluttershy, open-

67
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,869
Hi, Rainbow Dash.

68
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,732
Fluttershy, what happened to you?

69
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:32,601
Oh, I...
I think I have the pony pox.

70
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:36,931
I'm sorry, I really, really wanted
to come to training day today...

71
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:41,131
But this pony pox has really
knocked me for a loop.

72
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:45,034
Oh, you poor thing.

73
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,969
You know, there's only
one cure for pony pox.

74
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:50,457
I know, plenty of bed-

75
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,091
Cold water!

76
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,868
Those pony pox are clearing right up.

77
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,094
Y'know, all of a sudden I'm,
I'm starting to feel better.

78
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,547
I'll just get out of these robes and-

79
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:08,034
My wing, oh ow, it's hurt.
I guess I can't fly after all.

80
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:11,081
Messed up wing, huh?

81
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:17,131
Stop horsing around, Fluttershy.
We've got a lot of training to do.

82
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:19,301
Come on now, what's going on?

83
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,273
Well, y'see, uh, well...

84
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:26,286
Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
I can't fly!

85
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:27,950
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:30,460
Just last week you went into
that wicked nose dive

87
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:32,951
to save that falling baby bird
right before it hit the ground!

88
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:35,584
But that was different,
that was an emergency!

89
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,101
This whole tornado thing,
it's more like a performance.

90
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:42,037
And you know how I hate performing
in front of others.

91
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,989
Don't you remember flight camp?

92
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,389
I couldn't gallop hard, or fly fast.

93
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,692
Not with everypony looking at me!

94
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:50,651
It wasn't that bad.

95
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:53,294
You're right, Rainbow Dash,
it wasn't bad.

96
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:55,131
<i>It was horrible!</i>

97
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,585
<i>All the other foals
used to tease me</i>

98
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,036
<i>a lot!</i>

99
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:14,821
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

100
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:20,481
I just can't risk that
sort of humiliation again.

101
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:23,964
Suck it up, Fluttershy!
This is no time for-

102
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,431
I mean, confidence or no confidence,

103
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:31,929
I'm gonna need every pegasus
to break the record, including you.

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,039
I need every ounce of wing power
I can get.

105
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,523
I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...

106
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:41,631
Thanks anyway.

107
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:45,951
Wait.

108
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:47,702
I'll do it.

109
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:49,491
- You will?
- I will.

110
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,102
- You're game?
- I'm game.

111
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,008
Alright!

112
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,533
What exactly does this machine do?

113
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,438
This is an anemometer.

114
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,567
It measures your accelerative velocity
and translates it into wing power.

115
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:12,048
Thus gauging your cumulative H2O
anti-gravitational potential.

116
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,113
Any other questions?

117
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:15,564
Yeah.

118
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,742
What exactly does this machine do?

119
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:21,745
It tells you how fast you're flying
and how strong your wings are.

120
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,713
Is that you again, Thunderlane?

121
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:32,359
Please, we need to have
a germ-free environment.

122
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,593
It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth.

123
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,324
Don't worry, Twilight.

124
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:40,063
Thunder Lane is just cooking up an excuse
to spend tornado day in bed.

125
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:43,563
Why don't you get over here
and be our first test flier, Thunderlane?

126
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,660
We have 9.3 wing power.

127
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,760
Wow! That's fast!

128
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,360
Yeah!

129
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:02,933
Not bad...not bad.

130
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:25,025
16.5 wing power!

131
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,704
Now listen up!

132
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:32,943
If each of you can get your numbers
up to at least 10.0 wing power

133
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:34,094
by the end of the week,

134
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:36,571
we'll no doubt set
a new tornado speed record.

135
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,022
We'll be number one!

136
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:08,602
Impressive.
Fluttershy, your turn.

137
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:32,124
Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly...

138
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,795
- Tell her!
- No, you tell her!

139
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:44,046
No, you!

140
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:50,587
Great job, Fluttershy!
You measured... point five.

141
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:54,642
Point five? Isn't that like...
less than one?

142
00:09:56,517 --> 00:10:00,964
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

143
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:11,498
Fluttershy, wait!

144
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,892
So some punks poked a little fun at you
and you got stage fright, big deal.

145
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:18,457
You aren't gonna go quit
just because of that, are you?

146
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,898
Yes!

147
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:24,246
But I need you!

148
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:28,935
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just
don't have the courage right now...

149
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:58,711
Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid
a couple of little acorns won't solve

150
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:00,748
my big flying problem.

151
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:06,767
I tried, but you should've seen
those ponies laughing at me...

152
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,367
I know it's important
to have confidence in myself...

153
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:17,159
Yes, yes, I do remember.
The river was swelling...

154
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:20,603
... and you were scared.

155
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:24,420
Yes, I did tell you to never give up

156
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,478
and to believe in yourself.

157
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,833
You're right, my friends.
I shouldn't give up.

158
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:36,253
I will get my confidence up and show
everypony that I am a good flyer!

159
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,868
A great flyer!

160
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:05,288
That's wonderful, Flitter.
Much better than yesterday.

161
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:09,068
This is crazy awesome!
We're gonna smash that record!

162
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:11,838
What'd he say?

163
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,128
Do I look like I speak squirrel?

164
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,901
What's that?

165
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,738
Two point three? Two point three?!

166
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,818
That has to be some kind of mistake!

167
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:42,903
I worked so hard!

168
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,612
Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!

169
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:48,282
You did awesome, Fluttershy.

170
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:51,508
No I didn't. I thought I'd
gotten over my nerves,

171
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:53,501
but they still got the best of me!

172
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:57,269
There's no way I'll fly with
10.0 wing power tomorrow!

173
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,370
So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power.

174
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,134
Every bit counts!

175
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:04,633
How would you feel if everypony
else was flying with 10.0 wing power

176
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:07,382
and you were flying with 2.5?

177
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:10,485
Actually, it was only 2.3, and- ow!

178
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:15,434
Well, uh... I'd feel...

179
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:18,898
Exactly! Humiliated!

180
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:22,168
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash,
I just can't do it!

181
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:24,465
It's okay, Rainbow Dash.

182
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:26,518
You've still got plenty of
wing power for your tornado.

183
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:29,218
You'll be able to lift tons of water up
to Cloudsdale!

184
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,468
If only there was a way to lift
Fluttershy out of the dumps...

185
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:51,615
Are we ready to do this?

186
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:57,785
Look!

187
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:01,829
Lazy Thunderlane!
Where is he?!

188
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,737
He's been trying to get out
of tornado duty the whole time

189
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:06,282
with his fake coughing and all.

190
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,125
Rumble, where's your lazy brother?

191
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,662
He's got the feather flu.

192
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:11,609
He's down at Ponyville hospital.

193
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,866
But he's not the only one.

194
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:20,554
Let's see, with those eight sick pegasi
out with the feather flu...

195
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:21,825
Oh no!

196
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:24,675
Don't tell me we won't be able
to break the windspeed record?

197
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:25,826
No...

198
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:30,605
You might not have enough wing power
to create a tornado powerful enough

199
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:33,015
to lift the water to Cloudsdale!

200
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,611
Well, should we pack up?

201
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,390
No. Of course not.
Forget the record.

202
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,800
Cloudsdale still needs water!

203
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:49,265
Okay, everypony,
let's give it all we've got!

204
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:52,758
On the sound of the horn, we take off!

205
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:10,815
You think they're gonna make it
to eight hundred wing power?

206
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,225
I sure hope so!

207
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,209
One hundred and fifty wing power.

208
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,179
Two hundred and fifty wing power.

209
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:20,294
Five hundred wing power!

210
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:25,933
Seven hundred and fifty wing power!

211
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:27,084
Twilight!

212
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:30,590
Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!

213
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:34,759
I figured, if I couldn't help
Rainbow Dash with the tornado,

214
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,305
the least I could do
was offer moral support!

215
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,141
She could sure use it,
considering eight pegasi

216
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,155
are sick with the feather flu!

217
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:44,750
Oh no! That's terrible news!

218
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,690
Are you okay?

219
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:09,041
I'm fine!

220
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,737
You were so close to the
eight hundred wing power minimum!

221
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:14,999
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.

222
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,186
We've got to try again!

223
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,733
But you've pushed your crew
to their limit already!

224
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:24,621
If you break apart again,
somepony could get hurt!

225
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,965
You should quit, it's not safe!

226
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:29,139
No! One more time!

227
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,069
I've gotta know we gave it our all!

228
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,679
If I'm going down, I'm going down flying!

229
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:38,679
C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!

230
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:41,999
Yeah!

231
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:51,603
Okay, here we go...

232
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,630
One hundred wing power!

233
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:57,095
Two hundred... five hundred!

234
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:59,561
Stay in position!

235
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,156
Flap those wings! Faster!

236
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:04,399
Seven hundred!

237
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:09,836
Seven hundred and fifty wing power!

238
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:14,628
They fell apart right after this!

239
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,945
I'm too nervous to look!

240
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,403
C'mon! Just a little harder!

241
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:24,565
I can see the water
trying to funnel through!

242
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,758
Seven ninety five! We are so close!

243
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:30,324
Fluttershy, they need you up there!

244
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,965
I won't make a difference!

245
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:35,191
You can make a difference!

246
00:18:35,342 --> 00:18:40,198
My measly 2.3 wing power
is still too little!

247
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:42,491
It's sticking at seven ninety five!

248
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,398
I don't know if they've got
any more in 'em!

249
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:47,844
Do it for Equestria!
Do it for Rainbow Dash!

250
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,620
Do it for yourself!

251
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:20,075
It's moving!
She's doing it!

252
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:25,115
Seven ninety eight!

253
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:27,872
She surpassed her best
wing power number!

254
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:38,335
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

255
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:40,948
No!

256
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:43,700
What was that?

257
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,975
I think it was Fluttershy!

258
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:03,815
She did it! She did it!
They all did it!

259
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,467
Whoa, girl, take it easy!

260
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:34,365
Whuh, what? Did we do it?

261
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:37,552
Yeah, we did it!
You did it!

262
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:44,125
Great job, Fluttershy,
that was awesome!

263
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,575
Yeah, we couldn't have done it
without you.

264
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:47,926
Nice job, Rainbow Dash.

265
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:51,265
You may not have set a new record,
but you showed a lot of guts.

266
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:52,650
Thanks.

267
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,537
But if you wanna talk guts,
then you've gotta give it

268
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,603
to my number one flyer,
Fluttershy!

269
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,515
Let's hear it for Fluttershy!

270
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:06,264
Fluttershy! Fluttershy!
Fluttershy can really fly!

271
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,173
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

272
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:13,702
<i>sometimes you can feel like
what you have to offer</i>

273
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:16,167
<i>is too little to make a difference.</i>

274
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:20,205
<i>But today, I learned that
everypony's contribution is important.</i>

275
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:21,795
<i>No matter how small.</i>

276
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:27,265
<i>If you just keep your head high,
do your best, and believe in yourself,</i>

277
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,374
<i>anything can happen.</i>
