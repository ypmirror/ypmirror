1
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,440
Well, don't stop there! You
read; I pack. That's the deal!

2
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.
I just keep thinking about

3
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,940
how much fun you're
going to have

4
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,480
at the Daring
Do Convention.

5
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,970
I wish Princess Celestia
didn't need my help

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,230
with the friendship
summit in Griffonstone.

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,250
Don't worry. I'll make sure
AK Yearling signs your book.

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,080
I can't believe she's
going to be there.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,990
She never goes
to conventions.

10
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,470
Which I guess will be cool for
all those other fan-ponies,

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,270
but since you and I know
AK Yearling personally...

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,930
...and we know that she's
secretly Daring Do, herself...

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,140
It's no big deal.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,760
This convention'll be fun,

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,920
but it's nothing to
get too excited about.

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,060
So! Excited!

17
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,850
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
Episode released inside a pony convention!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

18
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,590
You look like a pony who'd
be up for an all-inclusive,

19
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,270
one-of-a-kind, adventu-cation
where you get to live

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,640
"The Daring Do Experience."

21
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,590
No thanks. Did
that already.

22
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,680
Ah!

23
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,240
This is the awe--

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,770
--someest thing ever!

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,970
Now this is something that only
a true fan can appreciate.

26
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,360
They even put the tiles
in the right order!

27
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,410
Good catch. I'm Quibble Pants.
Nice to meet you.

28
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,110
Rainbow Dash.
Nice costume.

29
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,070
You too.

30
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,710
Thanks. The hard part was
figuring out the right--

31
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,530
--number of arrow holes.

32
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,493
B-because on page eighty-four
of Sapphire Stone,

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,710
it describes her dodging a quote
"score of arrows shooting forth

34
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,490
from holes in the
very walls," unquote,

35
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,500
but then on page one hundred and
seven, Daring Do says she quote

36
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,540
"barely made it past the trap's
barrage of arrows" unquote.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,440
But clearly, Daring
Do is embellishing

38
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,230
and the correct
number of arrows is--

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,550
Twenty.

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,400
I am so glad I
ran into you.

41
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,900
Even though I knew
the convention

42
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,420
would be totally awesome,

43
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,930
it's more fun when
you're with someone

44
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,780
who really knows
Daring Do.

45
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,240
I know what you mean.

46
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,610
It's so hard to find a
pony who really gets it.

47
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,110
That's weird. We've only done
stuff from the first trilogy.

48
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,680
After lunch, we should probably
start working our way back

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,650
through the other books.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There
are no "other books."

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,570
Of course there are.

52
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,660
Daring Do and the Trek
of the Terrifying Tower,

53
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,020
Daring Do and the
Many Faces of--

54
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,070
Uh, please, please don't. Just
don't even mention the titles.

55
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,740
I'm not saying those
books don't exist.

56
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,350
I'm saying that I refuse
to acknowledge them.

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,630
Why?

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,210
Because they're horrible!

59
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,710
I mean, there isn't a single
thing after Ring of Destiny

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,240
that is even remotely in
the realm of the possible.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,220
WHAT! I know for a
fact that everything

62
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,500
in every one of those books is
one hundred percent possible!

63
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,240
And how could you
possibly know that?

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
I just do.

65
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,690
Well, that's a
compelling argument!

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,710
Why would you even
come to this convention

67
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,450
if you hate Daring
Do so much?!

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,780
I don't hate Daring Do.

69
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,590
The first series
was smart and cool

70
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,370
and an amazing nod to old-time
serialized adventure books

71
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,580
that somehow manages to be
self-reflexive and ironic

72
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,290
while at the same time
celebrating the art form

73
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,950
without a hint of cynicism.

74
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,950
Which is why I came here to ask
AK Yearling, muzzle-to-muzzle,

75
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,920
why she sold out and dumbed
down the rest of her books

76
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,210
into just a series of
impossible action sequences.

77
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,840
OK, now I know
you're crazy.

78
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,630
AK Yearling is awesome and every
Daring Do book that comes out

79
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,120
is better than the last.

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,800
Wow. OK. Yeah. I'm-I'm sorry
but I could never be friends

81
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,610
with somepony who's willing
to believe impossible stuff

82
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,630
is possible as long
as Daring Do does it.

83
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,320
That's OK, because I could
never be friends with somepony

84
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,810
who's so focused on
things being possible

85
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,270
that he's willing
to turn his back

86
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,200
on the coolest hero
of all time!

87
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,980
Fine!

88
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,790
Fine!

89
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,220
Look, just tell AK Yearling
that Rainbow Dash is here

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,760
and I need her help to
convince a know-it-all pony

91
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:44,609
that everything Daring Do's
ever done actually happened.

92
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,523
<i>Rainbow Dash?</i>

93
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:52,080
AK! I've got to talk to
you! It's an emergency!

94
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:54,326
Not here.

95
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:03,624
Now, tell me what's going on. Is
it Caballeron? Did you see him?

96
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:05,280
What? No.

97
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,701
But there is a pony downstairs
who thinks everything

98
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:11,544
you've written after the first
trilogy is totally unrealistic

99
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,944
and terrible and I need
you to help me prove to him

100
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,790
that it's all
totally possible.

101
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:17,784
I've got bigger
problems on my hoofs

102
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:19,735
than dissatisfied
fan-ponies.

103
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:22,375
Whoa!

104
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,080
The Amulet of Culhuacan.
And Caballeron wants it.

105
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,824
But the amulet's
only a key. 

106
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,809
The real treasure is
hidden in a lost temple,

107
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,873
The Seven-Sided
Chest of Chicomoztoc.

108
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,055
Caballeron wants to sell it to
the highest bidder, of course,

109
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,381
which is why I need
to find it first.

110
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,969
YES! Sounds like another
awesome Daring Do Adventure!

111
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:46,455
But what are
you doing here?

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,424
Since I haven't
found the temple yet,

113
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,504
it's the safest place
for me and the Amulet.

114
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,193
It's crawling with security
and if I get into trouble,

115
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,876
I can just blend in with all
the Daring Do cos-players.

116
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,261
How can I help?

117
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,455
Just keep your eyes out
for anything suspicious.

118
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,021
Got it.

119
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,141
Does a pony who only
likes your first trilogy

120
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:09,698
qualify as suspicious?

121
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,320
Just checking.

122
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:21,969
I find all this fanfare around
my archenemy disturbing.

123
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,579
I mean, where is the
booth for Caballeron?

124
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,381
I do not see the likeness.

125
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:37,649
Come. Let us find Daring Do
and the Amulet of Culhuacan.

126
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:40,141
I don't want to spend any
more time in this place

127
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:41,009
than I have to.

128
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:51,667
Well, if it isn't the pony
who knows impossible things

129
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:55,144
can happen because
she just does.

130
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,830
Ugh. Sorry, Quibble, I've got
more important things to do

131
00:07:58,855 --> 00:07:59,870
than argue with a pony

132
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,455
who thinks awesome
means unrealistic.

133
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:07,206
No, wait. I wanna hear more
about how you're 100% sure

134
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,827
that in Curse of the Jungle
Queen, Daring Do could survive

135
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,027
a sixty-story drop from
the top of a waterfall

136
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:16,590
after sustaining a broken
wing in a category six rapid.

137
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,550
Ugh.

138
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:20,086
Obviously her wing
wasn't broke--

139
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:21,513
Caballeron!

140
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,541
See, now THAT'S a
great character!

141
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:27,335
Solid backstory.
Good motivations.

142
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:29,846
No-no-no! Caballeron
is right there!

143
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:32,326
Of course he is.

144
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:34,880
He's also over
there, over there,

145
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,990
Oh-oh over there,
and over there.

146
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:40,843
Where are you going?

147
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,572
And we're out here because...

148
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,480
Daring Do told me
that Caballeron

149
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,415
came to this convention to
steal the Amulet of Culhuacan

150
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:54,301
and I just saw him and his
henchponies come this way.

151
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,298
OK. I'm gonna head back inside.

152
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:59,532
Just a little
too much crazy out here

153
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:00,713
for the both of us.

154
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:10,209
I do not know what
Daring Do is playing at,

155
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:13,015
but if she told you two
fanponies of my plan

156
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:16,904
to steal the Amulet,
you must work for her.

157
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:21,384
Caballeron! HA! What do you
have to say NOW, Quibble?

158
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:24,880
This was your plan to prove the
Daring Do books are realistic?

159
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:28,935
You bought a "Daring Do
Experience, Adventu-cation"?

160
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,778
Really?

161
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:34,929
What?! NO! Look around us!
Henchponies. Caballeron!

162
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,701
The jungle it took forever to
get to! This is the real deal!

163
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:42,873
Right. We're ACTUALLY being
held captive by Caballeron.

164
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:46,073
Please. This guy's accent
is all over the place.

165
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,483
No offense.

166
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:48,344
I....

167
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,249
So, what's the setup,
here? You've kidnapped us

168
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,461
and taken us to the middle
of nowhere because....?

169
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:58,260
The Temple of Chicomoztoc is
somewhere in this jungle!

170
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,516
When I find it, the Seven-Sided
Chest is as good as mine!

171
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:06,393
I just need the Amulet of
Culhuacan to unlock it!

172
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:09,126
Uh-huh. And Daring
Do has the Amulet,

173
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:11,618
so you came up with this
overcomplicated plot

174
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,947
to lure her into the jungle
and exchange it for us?

175
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:18,387
I wouldn't call it
overcomplicated, but yes.

176
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,443
OK, we're done here. Great work.

177
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,076
Seriously. Very believable.

178
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,627
Listen pal, you can keep
her money, but I'm not --

179
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,510
Going anywhere.

180
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,040
You may not approve of my plan,
but I'm the mastermind here.

181
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,009
Debatable.

182
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:42,455
AND I SAY you will remain
here until Daring Do

183
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:45,993
comes to rescue you. And if she
wants you back in one piece,

184
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,966
she will give me the
Amulet! Tie them up.

185
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,396
The Griffon's Lock!

186
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:54,732
You know of it!

187
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,120
Further proof that you
are an agent of Daring Do.

188
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:58,996
Or an avid reader.

189
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:04,043
And now I will continue
my search for the Temple.

190
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:10,436
Don't go anywhere.

191
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,353
Listen, if I pretend to
believe this nonsense is real,

192
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:17,224
will you call off the henchpony
repertory theater over there?

193
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:20,904
They're not going to listen
to me. They abducted us BOTH!

194
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,715
Oh, wow. So you're going
to stick with that script?

195
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:27,027
Oh, OK fine. We're in
a Daring Do adventure.

196
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:31,858
What was that?

197
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,621
DARING DO! THANK
GOODNESS! WE'RE OVER HERE!

198
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:40,190
Fan out! We can't let
Daring Do rescue these two.

199
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:46,203
All four? I mean, shouldn't at
least one of them stay behind

200
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,664
to guard us? Oh-oh
wait, no because then

201
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,409
it wouldn't be a terrible
Daring Do adventure!

202
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,126
It doesn't matter.

203
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,735
We'll never solve the Griffon's
Lock before they get back.

204
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,701
OK, that was pretty good.

205
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,304
Quick! We've got to get out
of here and warn Daring Do!

206
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,944
No way. Just point
me to the hotel

207
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,307
and you can play fanpony

208
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,301
and hunt treasure
out here all day long.

209
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,329
Fine. Let's say this IS a
Daring Do Adventu-cation.

210
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:18,609
The only way to get back to the
convention is to go through it.

211
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,366
So just follow me and
I'll lead you out. Deal?

212
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,436
Ugh. Fine.

213
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,449
Maybe if I just leave you in
the jungle, it'll convince you.

214
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,744
Which would make Daring Do left-
hoofed, which we KNOW is false!

215
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:35,618
And THAT is everything
that's wrong with Daring Do

216
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:37,335
and the Trek to the
Terrifying Tower.

217
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,784
Now the problems with
the next book are even --

218
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,796
Oh, right. What Daring Do
adventure would be complete

219
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,286
without the precarious
rope bridge?

220
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:55,170
Look, I'm all for making things
feel as real as possible

221
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:59,040
but are these adventu-cation
ponies sure this thing is safe?

222
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,686
Is it too "realistic" for you?

223
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:04,492
Wouldn't want THAT on a
Daring Do adventure, would we?

224
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,726
If this were really a
Daring Do adventure,

225
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,092
I'm sure I'd step on the wrong
plank at exactly the wrong mo-

226
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,615
Heh. Good thing this is all
just a pretend adventure.

227
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,824
At least we know all
of this struggling

228
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,381
won't make the
bridge fall apart.

229
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,227
You need to get
your money back.

230
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,378
Ha! How's THAT for
not possible!

231
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:50,627
THAT. WAS. AWESOME!
I-I-I thought we...

232
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:53,310
And then you...
and the flying...

233
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,538
Wow, and I was like
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

234
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:56,929
And then you swerved!

235
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:01,735
And I was-was-was on the water!
And the-the rocks?! WOW.

236
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,680
Yeah. If you read
that in a book

237
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:06,104
you might even think
it was unrealistic.

238
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,944
OK. I'll give
you that one.

239
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:09,950
I mean we could
have been done for.

240
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:11,600
We could have been
done for!

241
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:13,452
What kind of
Adventu-cation IS this?

242
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:17,396
I mean that's just bad business!
What are these ponies thinking?

243
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:18,436
<i>Right now?</i>

244
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:22,307
We are thinking that we should
thank you for escaping.

245
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:31,187
For you have led us directly to
the Lost Temple of Chicomoztoc!

246
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,849
Make sure they are
secure this time!

247
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,418
We can't have them
escaping again.

248
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:45,907
You'll never get
away with this.

249
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:48,560
Won't I? You've led
me to the temple.

250
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:52,713
And Daring Do is too noble to
let harm befall her companions

251
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:56,313
so the amulet is
as good as mine.

252
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:01,003
What? No witty remarks this time
about how silly my plan is?

253
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:04,264
This isn't the official
Daring Do Experience

254
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:05,963
Adventu-cation, is it?

255
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,181
FINALLY!

256
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:10,806
It's some cheap knock-off run by
a bunch of incompetent ponies

257
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:13,206
that have no idea how to
execute this adventure

258
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,590
with any level of safety!

259
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:16,443
Ugh.

260
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,747
What was that with the bridge!
We were in serious danger!

261
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,846
I'm reporting you all to...

262
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,735
Well, I don't know who
I'm reporting you to,

263
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,618
but it's gonna be
somepony important!

264
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:29,661
Oh, and this cut-rate
excuse for an "experience"

265
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,593
hasn't proved anything
except that I'm right.

266
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,904
It has all the hallmarks of
a lame Daring Do adventure.

267
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:38,295
Uh... Quibble?

268
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,569
No. I'M talking! Generic
jungle locations? Check.

269
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:44,375
Overly complicated
villain plot? Check.

270
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:47,070
Random coincidences
that conveniently

271
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,563
get us to the next
big set piece? CHECK!

272
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,415
Watch where you are
stepping, you fool!

273
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:55,501
Listen, buddy, I
don't take orders

274
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:58,215
from some second-rate
performer who learned acting

275
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:00,910
from the supervillain
school of bad accents.

276
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:03,944
The only thing this mess
is missing is some giant

277
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:06,720
Ahuizotl wanna be monster
and I have a feeling

278
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,110
that would be a bit too much

279
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,033
for you bargain basement
adventurers to pull off.

280
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:17,815
Um. You're real.

281
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:19,544
This is real?

282
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:22,018
THIS IS REAL!

283
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:36,381
I told you to warn me
of anything suspicious,

284
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,101
not run off on an
adventure without me.

285
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:42,129
Whoa whoa whoa. You're real.

286
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,449
You're-you're...
friends with her?

287
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:48,763
Uh, we'll have to do
introductions later.

288
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:49,901
Right now we have to--

289
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:52,473
Get out of here. Yes! Thank you!

290
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,510
Actually, no.

291
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:55,587
WHAT?

292
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:58,024
We can't leave
without the treasure.

293
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:00,640
And we should probably get
to it before our friend

294
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,704
gets any higher.

295
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,147
Whoa!

296
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:12,867
Seven doors, Seven locks. One
of them leads to the treasure.

297
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,292
I'd rather not think about
what the others lead to.

298
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:18,166
Yeah, yeah. The classic
pony and the tiger bit.

299
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,440
All you have to do is--

300
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:22,443
Um... Maybe you should let
Daring Do figure it out?

301
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,418
Oh, excuse me.

302
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:30,301
Not that one.

303
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:37,673
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhh.

304
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,049
Is he always like this?

305
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,335
Yeah. But...he's
usually right.

306
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,993
Which lock do YOU think it is?

307
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:50,320
FINALLY! Look. Each door has
another door that matches.

308
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:53,667
THESE two both have earth
ponies fighting serpents.

309
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:56,750
THESE two have Pegasi
fighting Griffons.

310
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:01,618
THESE two have unicorns
fighting bears. But THIS one...

311
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:04,960
Has an alicorn on it!

312
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,126
It's the only one without a
match. How did I miss that?

313
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:12,036
I've been asking myself
that ever since book four.

314
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:20,873
The Seven-Sided
Chest of Chicomoztoc.

315
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,855
Uh, guys?

316
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,833
The way out is
totally covered!

317
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:31,476
How are we gonna
get out of here?

318
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:33,390
There!

319
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,775
Seriously, do you
ever NOT escape

320
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,147
out of the top of a temple?

321
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,883
We'll have to carry mister
adventure critic out with us.

322
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:44,387
We won't be fast enough!
We'll never make it!

323
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:45,144
Guys!

324
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:49,218
I think Rainbow Dash
and I have this covered.

325
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:58,633
Go around! You
can't go over him!

326
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:01,218
Go over him? Are you crazy?

327
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:04,658
If Quibble says go
over him, go over him!

328
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:12,990
You two are insane!

329
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,193
You SAID go over him!

330
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,532
I SAID go around him!

331
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,384
And I said be quiet!

332
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:21,655
This way! I heard them!

333
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:25,378
OK, I've got it. Let's
create a fake treasure

334
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:28,504
out of mud and rocks, give THAT
to Caballeron and then when--

335
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:32,098
Not EVERY Daring Do plan
has to be super complicated.

336
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:36,486
I swear I heard them!

337
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:45,064
I'll get you Daring Doooooooo!

338
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,015
Uh. Not particularly original
or inspired, but it worked.

339
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:52,646
Who are you again?

340
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:53,624
He's a fan.

341
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:57,655
Uh-huh. There's some stairs on
the other side of the temple

342
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,033
that lead out of
the ravine.

343
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:01,741
I suggest you two take
them and head west.

344
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:02,720
What about you?

345
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:06,196
I've got to get this to a
museum. Thanks for your help.

346
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,390
I couldn't have done it
without you. Both of you.

347
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,667
So?

348
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,920
So. Maybe the later books
ARE slightly more realistic

349
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,406
than I gave them credit for.
I still don't like them.

350
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,104
What? How can you--

351
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,683
Wait! Hold on! Before
we get in another fight,

352
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:28,744
I think I finally
figured it out!

353
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,910
I love the Daring Do that solves
puzzles and uses her brain

354
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,227
to get out of tough situations.

355
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:36,818
And she did WAY more of that
in the original trilogy.

356
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,233
YOU love the Daring Do
that is brave and awesome

357
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:42,652
and comes out on top no
matter what the odds.

358
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,584
OK.

359
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:46,221
And that's OK!

360
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:49,058
We might never agree on
what makes Daring Do cool.

361
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:52,313
But YOU are definitely cool.

362
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:56,301
I mean the way you saved
me on the bridge? Wow.

363
00:20:56,646 --> 00:21:01,741
And escaping from the temple!
You, Rainbow Dash, are AWESOME.

364
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:06,516
Well. I'm not the one
who can locate a treasure

365
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:08,849
in half the time Daring Do can.

366
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,058
You may have terrible
taste in books,

367
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,544
but you're pretty
awesome yourself.

368
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,027
In a brainy egghead puzzle-
solving kind of way.

369
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,283
I guess we don't have to agree
on everything to get along.

370
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:21,470
Friends?

371
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:23,243
DEFINITELY friends.

372
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:27,790
Do you think AK
Yearling would consider

373
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,286
letting ME write the next book?

374
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:30,492
I mean, think I could

375
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:31,981
make things way clearer.

376
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,073
I mean for instance, in
the second adventure

377
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,984
there's a side
character;

378
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:36,935
I don't want to kind
of name it right now,

379
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,738
because it's sort of
this thing that I've

380
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,320
already written a lot
of fan fiction on.

381
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:40,947
I don't want you know...

382
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,270
Not that I'm saying that
you would steal it;

383
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:45,015
but I am saying that this
would totally go along,

384
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:47,163
my whole thing about
puzzle solving.

385
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:49,323
Except what if each
puzzle that was solved

386
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,255
unlocked a new karate move?

387
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:52,670
Think of it that way, right?

388
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:54,781
I'm kind of a Yearlite myself,

389
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,461
so I'm sure she'd be open to--

390
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:57,963
Uh, Quibble?

391
00:21:58,393 --> 00:21:58,892
Sorry!
