1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,250
Come on! If we hurry,
we can get there

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,740
before the paper's even
delivered to Rarity's house.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,390
Maybe she won't
read the article.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,750
I'm pretty sure Rarity
is going to read a review

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,450
of her new boutique
in Manehattan.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,810
I still can't believe we
all just blabbed everything

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,450
that happened to
that reporter.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,080
I just hope it doesn't end
up being an article about

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,860
how her friends almost
ruined the opening.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,520
I think you're all
over-reacting.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,930
Rarity is our friend.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,480
If any pony is going to
understand, it'll be her.

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,850
I was wondering when all of
you were going to show up.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,460
Now we can all read
the review together!

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,140
Um, I have an idea. How
'bout we don't read it?

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,150
What she means is,
before you read it,

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,860
we should probably
tell you about--

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,730
No, no, darlings.
Please, no spoilers.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,700
But--

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,990
NO SPOILERS!

21
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:10,360
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu/

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,480
Now, is everypony ready
to hear what I'm sure

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
is a stellar review that
describes in stunning detail

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,620
exactly how each
of you contributed

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,040
to the successful opening
of Rarity for You?

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,560
"Many a pony has tried their
hoof at joining the ranks

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,910
of the elite fashion
trend-setters

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,260
currently ensconced
in the boutiques

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,280
of Manhattan's
famed Saddle Row.

30
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,580
Some might say it's the
ultimate achievement

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,930
in Equestrian fashion and
never before has a reporter

32
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,370
been granted such unfettered
behind-the-scenes access,

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,480
until now.

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,130
I wish it had been
more fettered.

35
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,040
Ah!

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,850
"I sat down with
Rarity and her friends

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,170
after the opening to
get the inside scoop.

38
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,750
And what a scoop it was..."

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,610
OK, kid. You successfully
opened a shop in Manehattan

40
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,400
and that's no mean feat.

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,360
Most ponies might wonder
what it feels like.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,610
Here's how it's gonna be.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,450
I'm going to interview
you and your friends

44
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,410
so I can paint a picture of
how it all came together,

45
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,890
a word picture mind you,
not an actual picture.

46
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,920
Any questions?

47
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,300
Well, I was wondering--

48
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,240
Let's get started!

49
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,680
Ms. Rarity. You got
shops all over Equestria,

50
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,760
but this was your first
time trying to make it

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,830
in the big city.

52
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,400
What made you think you
could tackle it on your own?

53
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, I wouldn't say
all over Equestria.

54
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,020
I just have two
other boutiques,

55
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,810
one in my home
town of Ponyville

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,340
and one in
Canterlot.

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,580
Uh, still, when I
decided to open this one,

58
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,930
I was nothing
but confident.

59
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,270
Let's just say that
if I could choose,

60
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,240
I probably wouldn't do it
that way again.

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,400
Well, it wasn't the
funnest party ever.

62
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,090
It was a plum-puckered,
pig-pushin' disaster!

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,220
After a lifetime of
awesome, I think everypony's

64
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,270
allowed to mess up every
now and then, right?

65
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,110
Wait, are you
writing this down?

66
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,920
Um. It didn't go exactly
how I thought it would,

67
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,560
but it um, started
out all right.

68
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,370
Welcome to Saddle Row.

69
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,210
An entire street lined with
the most fashionable boutiques

70
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,700
in all of Equestria.

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,650
If it's supposed to be
the most fashionable

72
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,610
block of shops,

73
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,230
where's Stinky Bottom's
Discount Hat Emporium?

74
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,620
I suppose it didn't
make the cut.

75
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,360
Here it is!
Rarity For You.

76
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,010
Rarity, it's lovely, but
are you sure you'll be ready

77
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,050
to open tonight?

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,750
Ah-CHOO!

79
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,930
No need to fret over
a mere moderate amount

80
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,550
of preparation. My
clothes arrive soon;

81
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,180
my sales associate after that
and with a little dusting,

82
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,520
we'll be ready for the
Grand Opening tonight.

83
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,640
Rarity! So good to see you.

84
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,080
Your store, it's going to be
a very good place, I think.

85
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,910
Mr. Stripes owns the building.
He's a very pleasant landlord.

86
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,320
A-a-although he can
be pushy at times.

87
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,800
OK, all the time.

88
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,810
You've met my daughter?
The apple of my ear,

89
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,650
the hay in my hoof. You
will let her work with you!

90
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,740
It's just... I'm
dreadfully busy preparing

91
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,870
for tonight's grand
opening, as you can see.

92
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,460
There are only two things I
love more than being pushy.

93
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,400
One is my daughter. The other
is miniature doll furniture.

94
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,240
And I would sell my entire
mini-furniture collection

95
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,980
to make my daughter
happy. You understand?

96
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,880
I'm sorry, I just don't think
it's going to be possible.

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,630
Let me say another way:

98
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,980
hire her or I raise rent
until you no can afford.

99
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,880
Oh, uh, welcome aboard!

100
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,490
First idea! Instead of clothes,

101
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,490
we sell glow-in-the-dark teeth.

102
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,580
Like this. but they'd
glow in the dark!

103
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,490
Golly, what a splendid idea! 

104
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,690
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK TEETH!
What was she thinking?

105
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,020
Fluttershy!

106
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,320
Your assistance is required
in the stock room post-haste.

107
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,170
Awwwww, hello.

108
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,090
But what are they doing here?

109
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,630
Smokey made too much
noise eating garbage,

110
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,730
so Softpad's mother made them
move out of the trash can.

111
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,600
Then Smokey Junior found a
nice home in the crawl space

112
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,160
behind the building, but
Mr. Stripes demolished it

113
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,060
so they were temporarily
camped out in the back

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,790
until they found a
new place to live.

115
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,300
No no no, I can't have a
family of rubbish-scented

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,560
raccoons living in my boutique.

117
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,840
Uh, did you hear that?

118
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,240
Turns out there's a Club
Pony Party Palace upstairs.

119
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,220
Turns out there's a Club
Pony Party Palace upstairs!

120
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,770
I'm sorry. Could you please
ask her to turn it down?

121
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,790
COULD YOU ASK HER TO
TURN IT DOWN PLEASE?

122
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,290
TURN IT DOWN PLEASE?
OH PLEASE!

123
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,890
Ugh. Foals today listen
to their so-called "music"

124
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,070
far too loud.

125
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,840
I realize that makes me
sound like an old mare.

126
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,520
But this is business!

127
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,670
I wish we were having
as much fun as they are.

128
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,910
Well, sweeping can
be fun too.

129
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,620
Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.
Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.

130
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,990
Only Twilight could make a
dance remix about sweeping.

131
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,740
I mean, how lame
is that?

132
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,840
Yeah, it wasn't
even catchy.

133
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,780
Nope.

134
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,060
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!

135
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,100
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!

136
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,810
Apparently, DJ Pon-3
has a residency

137
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,500
at the party
palace upstairs,

138
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,240
but security won't
let me speak to her!

139
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,660
Bahh! What in the name
of Celestia was that!

140
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,510
You know how most stores
have a little jingle bell

141
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,190
when the door opens? I thought
we should have something

142
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,680
with a little more "pizazz."

143
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,650
So I installed one of
Daddy's antique horns.

144
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,940
Ugh! We'll have to do
something about that.

145
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,170
After I think of a way
to quiet down that music.

146
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,590
And after I finish designing
the window display.

147
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,870
Ahhh!

148
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,780
Wait. is this my merchandise
shipment from Ponyville?

149
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,020
It's completely
disorganized.

150
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,500
Ah! Uh.

151
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,830
Ah...ugh...ah...

152
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,440
Gesundheit! Oh! Miss Pommel!
I'm so glad to see you.

153
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,300
Now, as the sole sales
associate at Rarity for You,

154
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,950
I hate to add to your
already overflowing plate

155
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,100
of responsibilities, but
it looks as though we have

156
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,040
just a tad more to do before
tonight than I thought.

157
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,630
Actually, I...Ugh ah! 
I can't work tonight.

158
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,160
Oh? Why not?

159
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,050
Feel better, my sweet. We'll
manage without you, somehow.

160
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,060
And we'll manage glowing
teeth and car horns

161
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,520
and disorganized
clothes and dance music.

162
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,890
Am I forgetting anything?

163
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,040
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

164
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,970
Well, opening a
store in Manehattan

165
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,690
is a pretty big deal.

166
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,400
It's natural that Rarity
would be a little stressed

167
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,130
about how it was going...
since it wasn't going well.

168
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,710
Still, I think she
handled it all right.

169
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,130
The dream is doomed!
Doomed, I tell you! Doomed!

170
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,270
I know things haven't
gone perfectly so far,

171
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,420
but we've done this
kind of thing before.

172
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,110
If we all work
together...

173
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,310
I appreciate the offer,
but this is Manehattan.

174
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,910
To make it in the
fashion scene here,

175
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,610
everything has to be perfect.
The perfect location.

176
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,810
The perfect clothes.
The perfect opening.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,790
Maybe we should
just postpone.

178
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,120
Postpone? Darling,
tonight is the last night

179
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,370
of the fall season.

180
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,130
If we don't open
tonight it won't be...

181
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,850
Perfect.

182
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,970
Yes. I know what needs to be
done. I just need more of me.

183
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,380
Oh, how I wish I could
make copies of myself!

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
Yeah. Making copies of
yourself always sounds

185
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,750
like a great idea, but
before you know it,

186
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,450
you're locked in a room
with fifty Pinkie Pies

187
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,560
watching paint dry.

188
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,350
We can do this and we can
stay true to your vision.

189
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,020
You'd do that? Fluttershy,
you'll handle those

190
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,250
strong-smelling
raccoons for me?

191
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,010
Of course!

192
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,440
Leave Plaid Stripes to me.
I'll handle her and her...uh

193
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,760
..."good" ideas.

194
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,790
Oh! Oh! Oh! And I can go
upstairs to that nonstop party

195
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,280
and have tons of fun
and eat some cake

196
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,460
and set up party
cannons and--

197
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,310
...and then make
them be quiet.

198
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,950
I'm pretty sure I know
somepony who wouldn't mind

199
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,330
organizing this merchandise
shipment for you.

200
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,520
I'm talking about myself.

201
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,980
Oh PLEASE let
me organize it!

202
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,550
This all sounds splendid, but
I don't even have a single

203
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,310
employee and I'll need
the best of the best.

204
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,520
Leave the hiring to me.

205
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,090
Oh! This is it,
my dears!

206
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,620
If you can handle
these problems,

207
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,230
I'll focus on the designs for
the front window display.

208
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,530
We'll show Manehattan what
Rarity for You is all about.

209
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,720
Aww! What would
I do without you?

210
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,190
What would she do without
us? Huh, let me think.

211
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,050
"Darlings, I'm absolutely
doomed! Doomed! DOOMED!"

212
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,990
Ha, I sounded
just like her.

213
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,700
Hey, you're not writing
this down, are you?

214
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,390
Now for the perfect
window display. Hmmm.

215
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,850
Ooo! I can't really
stop a super-fun party

216
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,780
in the middle of
mega-happy-fun times,

217
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,270
can I?

218
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,490
What would Rarity want?

219
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,530
Keep that party going
till the break of dawn!

220
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,770
Really?

221
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,690
Indubitably! And as for
the roof? Get jiggy!

222
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,960
Raise it, Pinkie!

223
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,900
Raise it like you've
never raised it before!

224
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,850
Hah! If you say so!

225
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh please, Pinkie Pie!

226
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,870
Never in a million years
would I say such balderdash!

227
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,910
Obviously DJ Pon-3 only
plays the sickest of beats.

228
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,430
I just wouldn't want her
to miss out on the coolest

229
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,070
new music straight from
the back alley underground

230
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,920
zip-zop party scene!

231
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,620
I'd play the whole
thing if I were you,

232
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,480
no matter what
other ponies think!

233
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,830
Awwwwww.

234
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,660
Rarity for You is only
hiring the best of the best

235
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,220
and to me that
means the fastest.

236
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,970
Now...uh, before
we begin...

237
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,120
Am I doing this right?
What would Rarity want?

238
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,200
New plan.

239
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,710
Who can be the first one to
tell me what fabric this is?

240
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,300
That's organza.

241
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,190
Are you sure?

242
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,240
It's a thin, plain
weave, sheer fabric,

243
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,240
traditionally made
from silk, so...yeah.

244
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,400
I don't know the first
thing about clothes.

245
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,610
Pretty much all I can
do is look at something

246
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,110
and tell you if
it's clothes or not.

247
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,960
This chair?
Not clothes.

248
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,790
See if you can keep
up with me here.

249
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,900
What are all
clothes made of?

250
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,540
Uh, fabric?

251
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,130
Bingo! But not in this
store. Uh uh. Not anymore.

252
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,090
Oh no?

253
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,700
Two words for you:
spoon clothes.

254
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,870
All our clothes will
be made of spoons!

255
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,540
What would Rarity want?

256
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,820
You know, I like
you, Plaid Stripes.

257
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,540
If it were up to me, we'd
have a spoon clothes store

258
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,160
right next to Stinky Bottom's
Discount Hat Emporium.

259
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,410
But it ain't up to me.
So...the answer is no.

260
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,260
Personally? I think spoon
clothes ain't such a bad idea.

261
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,150
Useful, too. Eatin'
soup. Stirrin' gumbo.

262
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,360
Diggin' little holes.

263
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,800
There. Perfect.

264
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,280
Although, what
would Rarity want?

265
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,690
Maybe she wouldn't
like it done by color.

266
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,650
Guess I have to
start over!

267
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,250
Hello Smokey. Softpad.
Smokey Junior.

268
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,880
I have some,
interesting news. I...

269
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,220
Oh, I'd like you to all stay
here forever, but...

270
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,360
What would Rarity want?

271
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,830
You have to move out!

272
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,530
A window display is the
first thing customers see.

273
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,730
And if they like it,
they'll walk inside

274
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,340
and experience the glory
that is my boutique.

275
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,180
I don't know which
one of you to hire!

276
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,890
Just keep guessing fabrics.

277
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,720
Daddy! Rarity's friend
doesn't like my ideas!

278
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,190
Spoon clothes! Is good idea!

279
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,340
Oh no! Not a shopping
music mash-up!

280
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

281
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,700
When you write the story,

282
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,400
could you maybe
skip over the part

283
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,010
where we locked Rarity in the
window display? 

284
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,600
Hello? The door
appears to be stuck.

285
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,060
Yep! We're working on it!

286
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,680
Hm. Well, shouldn't let
this time go to waste.

287
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,580
How did this happen?

288
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,160
I shut down the party.

289
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,260
I told Plaid Stripes no.

290
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,460
I asked the raccoons to leave.

291
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,230
I asked a lot of
fabric questions.

292
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,020
...just like I thought
Rarity would want.

293
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,990
Rarity asked us to help
her with everything

294
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,930
because she knows
all of us so well.

295
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,130
She knows how much
you care for animals.

296
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,610
She'd trust you to solve
the problem your way.

297
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,180
Maybe we should all
do the same.

298
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,990
Doing this our way
is what Rarity wants.

299
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,440
It's not too late. Let's all
dig in and we can fix this...

300
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,190
...before Rarity finds
out how bad we messed up.

301
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,550
I'm sorry I asked
you to leave.

302
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,760
The place is yours,
if you want to stay.

303
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,660
Though I would like to ask
you all just one favor.

304
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,890
I'm sorry I made you play
that unfun superboring music.

305
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,740
But if you're up for it,

306
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,750
I have an idea to make
the party even better.

307
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,850
OK, I don't get fabric,
but I do get speed.

308
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,920
And I need somepony
fast enough

309
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,620
to help all the costumers
Rarity is going to have so...

310
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,740
First one to the river
and back gets the job!

311
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,620
IT'S A RACE! GO!

312
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,060
Mr. Stripes, I owe your
daughter an apology.

313
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,860
She's got good ideas and I
should give 'em a chance.

314
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,020
So here's what
I'm thinking.

315
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,320
Perfect!

316
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,240
Wow, looks like we fixed
that door just in time!

317
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,120
Ooh. What's all this?

318
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,560
The whole place
organized by style,

319
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,130
cross-referenced by size and
reverse-indexed by fabric.

320
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,680
She'll be able to
find anything

321
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,510
in three seconds flat.

322
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,070
It was some of my
best work.

323
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,330
Oh, I knew I could
count on you!

324
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,380
All right. I suppose this
is the moment of truth.

325
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,660
Rarity for You
is now open!

326
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,900
Oh, dear, I wasn't quite
prepared for such a crowd.

327
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,440
How will I handle
them all?

328
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,850
My name is Blue Bobbin.

329
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,070
I'll be your personal shopping
assistant this evening.

330
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,840
Right this way,
everypony

331
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,370
and one of our talented sales
ponies can help you out.

332
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,050
Honestly, they were
all pretty slow,

333
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,460
but they finished the race.

334
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,820
Plus they knew a lot more
about fabric than I did,

335
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,130
so I hired them all.

336
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,510
The way I see it,
Rarity designs fashion.

337
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,290
DJ Pon-3 designs beats.

338
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,310
What better combination
than a boutique dance club?

339
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,560
After a quick bath, they were
more than willing to help.

340
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,050
Ah, a blue corn reduction
with shallot confit, but...

341
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,870
how can I possibly
enjoy it without a...

342
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,830
--Spoon?

343
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,440
Told ya spoon-clothes
ain't such a bad idea.

344
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,820
Ah! Mmm...mm!
Exquisite.

345
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,310
This is the most whimsical

346
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,660
and wonderfully fashionable
boutique I've ever seen.

347
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,570
"In the end, Rarity's
Grand Opening

348
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,380
was a smashing success.

349
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,800
True, it got off to
a rocky start..."

350
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,310
"...But somehow this ragtag
group of ne'er-do-wells"

351
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,260
Oo! Heavens, I
think he means you!

352
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,420
"came together and created
the perfect boutique,

353
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,080
a vision of Rarity,
combined with the expertise

354
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,820
of her friends.

355
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,370
This reporter, for
one, is a believer."

356
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,870
Why didn't you tell me there
were so many problems!

357
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,240
We all figured you had
enough on your mind.

358
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,380
And we didn't want you
to think that the opening

359
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,560
wasn't perfect. 
ne'er-do-wells or not,

360
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,120
I know I can always
count on all of you.

361
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,430
And nothing could be more
perfect than that.
