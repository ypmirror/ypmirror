1
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,676
Any minute now.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,808
Yee-haw!

3
00:00:16,107 --> 00:00:18,583
It's officially
apple bucking day!

4
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:20,220
Look at all those apples!

5
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:22,007
Ripe and juicy.

6
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,432
Perfect for bucking!

7
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:36,277
What the heck is going on?

8
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:39,266
They're back!

10
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:24,033
<i>Attention!</i>

11
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:27,026
This is a Sweet
Apple Acres code red.

12
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,223
I need all hooves
and claws on deck.

13
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:33,408
Calm down, Applejack.

14
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:34,743
Calm down?

15
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:37,192
How can I calm down
at a time like this?

16
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:39,535
Vampire fruit bats
are attacking

17
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,997
Sweet Apple Acres!

18
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:43,340
But I thought the fruit
bats usually stayed put

19
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,415
in the West Orchard.

20
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:45,990
The fruit bats do,

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,299
but these aren't just your
everyday ordinary fruit bats.

22
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:52,792
They're vampire
fruit bats.

23
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,283
I'll be durned if they
think they're gonna sink

24
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:57,200
their fangs into my
blue ribbon apple.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,644
Ooooh! Wow!

26
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,770
Awesome!

27
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,136
This here's our
entry into the

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,435
Appaloosa State Fair's
Produce Competition.

29
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,054
You know how much TLC goes
into gettin' an apple

30
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,283
to grow like this?

31
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:15,697
Applejack, when you go
big, you really go big.

32
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,597
Them Vampire Bats
want to shrivel it up

33
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:19,539
like a raisin.

34
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,873
Ooh,I'm sure if we
just let them know

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,040
how special that particular
apple is to you,

36
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,330
they'll leave it alone.

37
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:26,160
Yeah, right.

38
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:27,711
Be my guest.

39
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:37,073
Um, excuse me,
Mr. Vampire Bat.

40
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,806
We were just wondering if,
maybe, you wouldn't mind

41
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,365
leaving that really
big apple alone?

42
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:48,608
Well, what did he say?

43
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:50,279
Um, "yes".

44
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:51,194
Huh?

45
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,028
But it could
have been a "no".

46
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:53,869
Oh.

47
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:56,419
This is the first Vampire
Fruit Bat I've ever met

48
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:59,192
and well, it might
take some time for me

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,784
to really understand
their language.

50
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:02,148
Uh-huh.

51
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:05,797
And in the meantime, this
pest and his vermin friends

52
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:08,156
are gonna go
after my prized apple,

53
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:11,176
and while they're at it, every
other apple in the orchard.

54
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,003
These Vampire Bats are
nothin' but a bunch of monsters.

55
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:15,344
Monsters?

56
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:18,680
Oh! That's a bit harsh,
don't you think?

57
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:20,390
No, I do not.

96
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,281
I'm sorry, Fluttershy,
but I believe Applejack

97
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:44,798
has made the
better argument.

98
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:48,536
These vampire fruit bats
sound downright dreadful.

99
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:50,206
So let's get to
roundin' 'em up

100
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:52,208
so that they don't destroy
the rest of my orchard.

101
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,876
Fruit bat round up!
Fruit bat round up!

102
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:59,385
Um, excuse me, but what if
instead of rounding them up,

103
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,520
we let them have part
of the orchard.

104
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,062
Have you lost your
pest-lovin' mind?

105
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:08,560
They're only here
because they're hungry.

106
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,680
If we built a
sanctuary for them,

107
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,778
they could have their
own apples to enjoy.

108
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,755
After a while, they
could even help

109
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:16,232
the rest of your orchard.

110
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,438
The Vampire bats don't eat
the seeds of the apples

111
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,899
and when they
spit them out,

112
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:24,156
they grow into even more
productive apple trees.

113
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:27,617
Listen, Fluttershy, that
sounds real nice and all,

114
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,938
but every second we spend

115
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:31,018
buildin' this
so-called "sanctuary"

116
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:33,719
is a second they'll spend
destroyin' orchard.

117
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,424
You don't know
what it was like

118
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:37,400
the last time there
was an infestation,

119
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,312
but Granny Smith has told
me enough stories about it

120
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,723
that just the thought of
it gives me nightmares.

121
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:48,696
<i>Granny says we lost a huge</i>
<i>section of orchard that year.</i>

122
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:51,322
<i>They had to ration</i>
<i>out apples all winter.</i>

123
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:53,594
What about the cider?

124
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,332
There was still
cider, right?

125
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:56,245
Not

126
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:56,977
a

127
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:57,570
drop!

128
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:58,563
No cider?

129
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,173
No cider!

130
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:01,894
We need to round up
these monsters

131
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:03,531
and we need to do
it now!

132
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:06,359
If Granny Smith wasn't
with Apple Bloom and Big Mac

133
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:08,645
checkin' out our produce
competition in Appaloosa,

134
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,203
she'd be here tellin'
us to do just that.

135
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,388
I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but
I think Applejack is right.

136
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,309
I just wish there was another
way we could convince them

137
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,997
not to eat them in
the first place.

138
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,532
Maybe there is.

139
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,198
<i>So there's good news</i>
<i>and bad news.</i>

140
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:29,073
The good news is that
I've found a spell

141
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,495
that can get the
vampire fruit bats

142
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,710
to stop wanting to suck
the juice from the apples.

143
00:07:32,913 --> 00:07:34,720
But in order for
the spell to work,

144
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:37,570
I need the bats' full
and complete attention.

145
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:39,769
Oh, no.

146
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:43,180
Fluttershy, I need you to
do your stare on the bats.

147
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:45,775
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,100
What's the problem?

149
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,042
You've used the stare
plenty of times before.

150
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:53,902
Yes, but it's not
something I take lightly;

151
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:58,331
I've made a vow not to use it
except in dire circumstances.

152
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:00,985
This circumstance is
plenty dire to me.

153
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:02,359
Me, too!

154
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:04,122
Think of the cider!

155
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:08,181
Won't somepony please
think of the cider!

156
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:12,339
I'm sorry, I just don't like
the idea of taking away

157
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:14,862
the thing that really
makes the vampire fruit bats

158
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,729
vampire fruit bats.

159
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,024
It just feels wrong.

160
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:21,650
But if we don't do this,
there won't be any apples

161
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,549
left for anypony
here in Ponyville.

162
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,525
Doesn't that
feel wrong, too?

163
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:36,021
So what's it going
to be, Fluttershy?

164
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,520
Will you do your stare
on the bats or not?

165
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,757
Um, um...

166
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,921
...OK, I'll do it.

167
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:45,258
Good choice.

168
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,550
I knew you wouldn't side
with those icky bats.

169
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:49,547
Ewwww!

170
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,112
They're not icky.

171
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,479
First round of
cider's on me!

172
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,309
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

173
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,875
We gotta round up these
beasts with wings first.

174
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:59,049
Time's a-wastin'!

175
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:31,921
Got you!

176
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,609
<i>Good work, everypony.</i>

177
00:09:49,613 --> 00:09:50,942
I think we got them all.

178
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,078
Now all we need is for
you to do your stare.

179
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,383
Um, are you sure I
really need...

180
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:00,011
OK.

181
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:04,193
I really, really, really
hate to do this to you.

182
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:06,435
I just hope you
can forgive me.

183
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:17,797
Good.

184
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,775
Now you go, Twilight.

185
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:20,975
All right.

186
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:40,080
You can stop
staring, Fluttershy.

187
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:44,940
Did it work?

188
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,254
Only one way to
find out for sure.

189
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,006
Whoo-ee!

190
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:56,548
My crop is saved.

191
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:57,998
Yee-haw!

192
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,057
We'll be drinking
cider all winter long!

193
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,640
I want to thank
you for your help.

194
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,296
<i>I couldn't have</i>
<i>done it without you.</i>

195
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,286
Don't mention
it, Applejack.

196
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,857
It was my
pleasure, really.

197
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:11,502
Now all we gotta do is
sweep up these cores

198
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:13,701
so I can start bucking
fresh tomorrow morning.

199
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,332
Apple bucking day, take 2.

200
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:28,878
YEEHAW!

201
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:33,047
Time to collect those
juicy sweet apples.

202
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,514
The spell didn't work.

203
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:43,516
You're durn tootin', the
spell didn't work.

204
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,474
I think we're going to have to
take more extreme measures.

205
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,005
I hear ya', Applejack.

206
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:52,440
Come on, everypony, let's
track down those Vampire Bats!

207
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,440
Wait a minute.

208
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:06,630
I don't think these bats
are the ones that sucked

209
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:07,810
my apples dry.

210
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:11,030
But if the vampire bats
aren't eating your apples,

211
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,357
who is?

212
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:15,494
Fluttershy, you're
our animal expert.

213
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,457
<i>Do you know of any other</i>
<i>creature that might be</i>

214
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:18,476
<i>capable of this?</i>

215
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:19,929
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,258
I don't.

217
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,100
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

218
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:25,416
We'll have to catch
whoever it is in the act.

219
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,615
And how do you
propose we do that?

220
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:29,469
A stake-out.

221
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:36,440
The witching hour.

222
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,385
Maybe we should
just call this off.

223
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,461
I'm not sure about the
rest of you guys

224
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,626
but I'm really hungry.

225
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,998
Oh, Fluttershy, it'll be OK.

226
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,942
Don't forget, darling,
we're all in this together.

227
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:00,136
That's right.

228
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:03,379
Nopony leaves this orchard
until we solve this mystery.

229
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:04,567
Agreed?

230
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:05,849
Agreed!

231
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:08,960
Does everypony have
their pony signal?

232
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,333
Now remember Pinkie Pie,
only use the signal

233
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:19,988
if you see something
suspicious.

234
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:21,280
I got it.

235
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,157
Something suspicious.

236
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,369
Whatcha doin?

237
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:35,361
All right, now
everypony split up.

238
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:37,594
We'll each patrol our
own row of the orchard.

239
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:41,221
Whoever or whatever is
destroying my apples

240
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,903
has got to be
here somewhere.

241
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,463
I have a bad
feeling about this,

242
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:54,433
a really bad
feeling about this.

243
00:13:55,724 --> 00:14:02,493
That apple, it looks
so juicy and sweet.

244
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,511
What was that?

245
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,090
Suspicious! Hee hee!

246
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,106
It's pony signal time!

247
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:26,251
Who's there?

248
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:31,656
Oh, well, there's
obviously no need to worry

249
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,187
about that shadowy
figure overhead.

250
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:36,643
Or maybe there is.

251
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:38,936
I think I'll just go see
how Rainbow Dash is doing.

252
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:43,621
Uh...

253
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,104
Who's there?

254
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,912
Answer me, or
you'll regret it!

255
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:55,207
Fine. Have it your own way.

256
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,172
Take that, you,
you, you...

257
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:02,023
<i>You scarecrow.</i>

258
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:17,982
Applejack, what is it?

259
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:22,638
Suspicious!

260
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:36,747
Fluttershy?

261
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:38,470
Yooo-hoo!

262
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:40,152
Fluttershy!

263
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,275
That's not Flutter-shy.

264
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:46,515
That's Flutter-bat.

265
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:48,595
We've got to get
her down from there.

266
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:52,464
Fluttershy sweetness,
please come down.

267
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:54,766
And do stop being
a vampire bat.

268
00:15:58,852 --> 00:15:59,722
Fluttershy!

269
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:01,477
It's me, Rainbow Dash.

270
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,696
Why don't you cut the
bat act and come on down?

271
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:08,222
Whoa!

272
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,201
Maybe we should just let
her come down when she's ready.

273
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:15,884
Flutterbat on the loose!

274
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:18,573
Run for your lives!

275
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:20,733
Pinkie Pie, calm down.

276
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,756
See, she's back
on her...branch.

277
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,674
<i>She's just biding her time.</i>

278
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,428
Waiting for the
right moment to pounce!

279
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,698
Pinkie Pie, bats
don't eat ponies.

280
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,729
Not even vampire bats.

281
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:36,647
But maybe vampire
ponies eat other ponies.

282
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:38,398
I'm not taking
any chances.

283
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:41,490
How did this happen?

284
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,564
That's what I
don't understand.

285
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,455
I think this was
actually our fault.

286
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:46,626
Our fault?

287
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,362
And how do you
figure that?

288
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:57,535
<i>OK, so this is me;</i>
<i>these are the bats</i>

289
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,914
<i>and this is Fluttershy</i>
<i>doing her stare.</i>

290
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,260
<i>The spell was supposed to go</i>

291
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:02,911
<i>right onto the bats like this.</i>

292
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,348
<i>But somehow the spell</i>
<i>must have backfired.</i>

293
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:09,440
It took the vampire fruit bats'
desire to be vampire fruit bats,

294
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,009
<i>and transferred that</i>
<i>desire into Fluttershy.</i>

295
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:15,332
C'mon! We'll reverse the
spell and make it right.

296
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,015
Then what are
we waiting for?

297
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,143
Let's save Fluttershy before
that thing eats us all!

298
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:23,693
Hit the deck!

299
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,817
Whoa!

300
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:27,650
Follow that bat!

301
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,659
I can't believe
we lost her.

302
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:43,063
Oh Fluttershy,
where are you?

303
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:56,764
Look out!

304
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:04,029
If she keeps this up, your whole
crop will be gone in no time.

305
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,849
That's the least
of my worries.

306
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:08,146
I just want my
friend back.

307
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:10,304
We'll never get her back
unless we corner her

308
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:12,109
and catch her so I can
reverse the spell.

309
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:23,344
There she is.

310
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:26,667
There she goes!

311
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,468
Oh, this is no use.

312
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:30,251
I think the only way we're
going to catch her

313
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:32,548
is if we find a way to
lure her closer to us.

314
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:34,889
But even if we can
lure her to us,

315
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:37,129
how are we going to get
her to stay still long enough

316
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,938
for you to do
your reverse spell?

317
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,033
Oooh! If only we had
Fluttershy to do her stare

318
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,233
on the Flutterbat.

319
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,618
That's it!

320
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:53,004
OK, let's get
our friend back.

321
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:54,407
Action stations!

322
00:18:56,462 --> 00:18:58,277
So much for having
the winning apple

323
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:00,273
in the Appaloosa
State Fair, huh?

324
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,001
She's coming!

325
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,205
Uh, where am I?

326
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:00,325
Thank goodness you're OK!

327
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,819
But what happened to me?

328
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,229
You turned into
a vampire pony!

329
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,301
I tried to eat ponies?

330
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:08,881
Of course not.

331
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,526
So I wasn't a vampire?

332
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:11,480
Yes!

333
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:12,185
"Yes," I was?

334
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,572
Or "Yes," I wasn't?

335
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,063
Yes, you were!

336
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:17,120
But I didn't try
to eat ponies?

337
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:17,707
Yes!

338
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,444
I did?

339
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:19,203
No.

340
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,618
I'm confused.

341
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:23,397
Me too, and I was there.

342
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:33,754
Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I
didn't take your suggestion

343
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,045
in the first place.

344
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,011
And don't forget; now
you'll get seeds that will

345
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,512
grow into even bigger
and better apple trees.

346
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,905
Does that mean what
I think it means?

347
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:47,559
Yep. More cider, too.

348
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:49,486
Ha ha! Wow!

349
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,832
<i>OK. Got the part</i>
<i>about the spell.</i>

350
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,404
<i>Fluttershy turning</i>
<i>into a bat.</i>

351
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:56,782
Building the sanctuary.

352
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,061
Be sure to put in there
that I came to see that my

353
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:02,491
short-term solution was
a little short-sighted.

354
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:04,762
And that you shouldn't let
anypony pressure you

355
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,207
into doing something you
don't think is right.

356
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,973
Sometimes you have to tell
even your closest friends, "no".

357
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,746
<i>Now how 'bout</i>
<i>we celebrate our</i>

358
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:18,052
stronger-than-ever friendship
with a nice, ripe juicy apple?

359
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,083
Stand back!

360
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:23,336
I vant to suck its juice!
