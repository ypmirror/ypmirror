1
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:09,700
Oh, what to wear?
What to wear?

2
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:12,074
Oh, what to wear?

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,280
Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom.

4
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,468
It's not like it's
the Harvest Day Parade.

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,222
We're just going
to the train station.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,594
Oh, too casual.

7
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:22,302
Too summery.

8
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:24,971
Your cousin isn't gonna care
what you're wearing.

9
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:26,690
Just pick something.

10
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:29,200
This is my first time
meeting her.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,177
And she's from Manehattan.

12
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:33,417
I want to make
a good impression.

13
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,160
You know what would make
a good impression?

14
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:35,720
What?

15
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,011
Being on time to pick her up!

16
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:40,142
Ah...

17
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:46,091
You got nothing to worry about,
sugar cube.

18
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:47,731
Y'all are gonna
get along great.

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,611
You already have
something in common.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,005
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

21
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:53,245
Neither of you have
your Cutie Mark.

22
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:57,445
What?! How could you forget to
tell me something like that?

23
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:00,628
- Well, I--
- Oh, this changes everything.

24
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,531
Meet you at
the train station.

25
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,531
I gotta tell Sweetie Belle
and Scootaloo.

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,674
You know your cousin
is supposed to sleep in here!

27
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:15,929

For distribution on grayjeager.blogspot.com

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,554
You really think
she'll want to join?

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,508
She doesn't have
her Cutie Mark.

30
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:00,365
Of course she'll want to join
the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

31
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,491
I'm just so excited
I could burst.

32
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:05,771
Is that the train
from Manehattan?

33
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:05,988
Yep.

34
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:13,485
That's her! Oh, wait,
no, no, that's not her.

35
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:15,160
Oh, wait. No, that's her.

36
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,942
Um, no. Wait.

37
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:20,485
That's not her either.

38
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:24,514
Apple Bloom, you've never
met Babs Seed, remember?

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,548
Oh, heh-heh, yeah.

40
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:28,380
Ah, that's her.

41
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:31,428
Babs! Babs!

42
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:33,462
It's me, your cousin,
Apple Bloom.

43
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,771
And this is Sweetie Belle.
And this is Scootaloo.

44
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:38,691
And we are so, so,
so glad you're here.

45
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:40,194
Thanks, I'm happy to--

46
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:42,165
This is going to be
the best week of your life!

47
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:43,410
Sure hope it's gonna be--

48
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,520
Seriously, we are
gonna have a blast.

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,817
The Summer Harvest Parade
is going on while you're here.

50
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,262
We get to ride in a float.

51
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,280
Really? I've never been
on a float before.

52
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:56,960
And we've got a really big
surprise for you.

53
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:59,754
Yeah. Uh, a surprise?

54
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:02,131
I give you...

55
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:05,097
...the Cutie Mark Crusaders
Clubhouse.

56
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,462
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

57
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,565
A club devoted to helping ponies
get their Cutie Marks.

58
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,542
We're its founding members.

59
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:19,228
Technically,
we're its only members.

60
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:20,897
But we're always
looking to expand

61
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:22,897
and you seem like
the perfect candidate.

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,205
I do?

63
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:25,194
Well, yeah.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,731
Since you don't have
a Cutie Mark and all.

65
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:30,320
Oh. Yeah. That.

66
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:32,640
Allow me to show you just
some of the highlights

67
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:35,131
of our clubhouse, should
you choose to join us.

68
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:43,285
This is where
we do our roll call.

69
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:43,891
Huh.

70
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,611
This is where
we eat our lunch.

71
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:57,120
Sometimes we stand here
and think up great ideas.

72
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:01,822
Yeah. Uh...

73
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,051
Uh, could you excuse us
for a moment?

74
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:07,194
Sure.

75
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,148
Thought she'd be
more impressed.

76
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:11,605
She's from Manehattan.

77
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,891
If we want to impress her
we need to really wow her.

78
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,565
Hmm...

79
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,085
Ah! The float.

80
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,737
She can ride with us on our
Summer Harvest Parade float.

81
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:23,302
That's perfect.

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,062
This really is a good spot
for thinking up great ideas.

83
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:27,771
Mm-hm.

84
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:30,982
Here it is.

85
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:33,702
The official Cutie Mark
Crusaders float

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,514
for the Summer
Harvest Parade.

87
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:38,674
As a member of
the Cutie Mark Crusaders

88
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:40,337
you'd be able to ride
on it with us.

89
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:41,868
It'd be totally fun.

90
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:43,577
Uh...

91
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:45,468
More like funny...

92
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:49,137
Looking! Ha-ha-ha!

93
00:04:50,462 --> 00:04:53,000
What is that thing?
A giant orange?

94
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,289
It's a pumpkin!

95
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,045
More like a lame-kin.

96
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,371
Who's the new blank flank?

97
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:08,422
She's my cousin, Babs.

98
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,440
She's from Manehattan.

99
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,451
Manehattan, huh?

100
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,560
Well, I guess you have
that going for you.

101
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,257
Suppose you're gonna join
their little club?

102
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,514
What's it called?
The Cutie Mark Crusaders.

103
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:32,097
More like
the Cutie Mark Crybabies.

104
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:37,171
- Hey!
- Ooh. Big city attitude.

105
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:39,765
I like it.
Mm-hm.

106
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:42,914
Oh, yeah? Well, there's more
where that came from.

107
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,662
Check this out. Unh!

108
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:47,725
Oh, no, she didn't.

109
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:02,142
Looks like somepony's pumpkin
just got squashed.

110
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,137
When I tell Applejack--

111
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,262
You gonna tell
Applejack what?

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,148
Well, you know, uh...

113
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,411
What are you, a snitch?

114
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:14,765
Come on, Babs.

115
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,097
You should hang with us.

116
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,165
You know, the cool ponies.

117
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,622
Not these babies.

118
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,908
What just happened?

119
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:28,491
I think Babs just
went to the dark side.

120
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:30,377
We have to tell Applejack.

121
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,834
No. We're not snitches.

122
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:35,788
Yeah.
And we're not babies.

123
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:39,720
Then why do I
feel like crying?

124
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,880
I still can't believe
she ruined our pumpkin float.

125
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:51,628
I still can't believe
I'm related to such a big stinking bully.

126
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:53,874
What are we going to do?

127
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:57,908
We're gonna build a new float,
that's what.

128
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,308
Why bother?

129
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,445
She'll probably just
ruin that one too.

130
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,542
We could always
tell Applejack.

131
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:08,942
What are you, a snitch?

132
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,005
No!

133
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,645
We're not gonna be
a bunch of tattletales.

134
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:16,880
Besides, she's only here
a couple of weeks.

135
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,880
We'll just avoid her like
the plague until she goes home.

136
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,902
Avoid her. Yeah.
How hard can that be?

137
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,730
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

138
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:28,380
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

139
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,140
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah</i>

140
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:35,171
<i>First we thought that Babs
Was so really, really sweet</i>

141
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,891
<i>A new friend to have</i>

142
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:38,925
<i>And it seemed like
Such a treat</i>

143
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:40,650
<i>But then we found the truth</i>

144
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,617
<i>She's just a bully
From the east</i>

145
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:46,428
<i>She went from Babs, yeah
To a bully and a beast</i>

146
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,788
<i>Everywhere we turn
She's just a step ahead</i>

147
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,908
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
What we gonna do?</i>

148
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,691
<i>Got a bully on our tail</i>

149
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,485
<i>Gotta hide
We gotta bail</i>

150
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:00,005
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
If she's after you</i>

151
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:01,788
<i>Gotta run
We gotta flee</i>

152
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:03,520
<i>Gotta hurry
Don't you see</i>

153
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:07,982
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
She's just a bad, bad seed</i>

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,348
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

155
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,160
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

156
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:13,800
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah</i>

157
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:17,805
<i>Hiding from a bully
We know it isn't right</i>

158
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,588
<i>But the Cutie Mark Crusaders</i>

159
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:21,240
<i>We aren't lookin'
For a fight</i>

160
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:23,348
<i>Oh, she'll go home soon</i>

161
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,371
<i>And then we'll have
Some peace again</i>

162
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,908
<i>But for now we're stayin'
Out of her way till then</i>

163
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:32,490
<i>Everywhere we turn
She's just a step ahead</i>

164
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:35,600
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
What we gonna do?</i>

165
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:39,148
<i>Gotta a bully on our tail
Gotta hide, we gotta bail</i>

166
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,680
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed
If she's after you</i>

167
00:08:42,685 --> 00:08:44,457
<i>You gotta run
We gotta flee</i>

168
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:46,257
<i>Gotta hurry
Don't you see</i>

169
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:48,080
<i>Why so mean?</i>

170
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,880
<i>Why so crude?</i>

171
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:51,920
<i>Why so angry?</i>

172
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,468
<i>Why so rude?</i>

173
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,125
<i>Can't you be nice?</i>

174
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,005
<i>Can't we be friends?</i>

175
00:08:57,348 --> 00:09:00,902
<i> Isn't it sad
Is this how it all ends? </i>

176
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,697
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed</i>

177
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,462
<i> She's just a bad, bad</i>

178
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,211
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed</i>

179
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:07,977
<i> She's just a bad, bad</i>

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,714
<i>Babs Seed, Babs Seed</i>

181
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:12,468
<i>She's just a bad, bad seed</i>

182
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:16,731
Babs may have
run us out of town,

183
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,554
but at least we still
have the club--

184
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,691
Hey! What are you doing
at my clubhouse?

185
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,771
Your clubhouse?

186
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,457
This is our clubhouse!

187
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,965
Well, it was yours.
And now it's mine.

188
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:34,137
And mine.

189
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,691
And mine.

190
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:37,702
That's not fair, Babs.

191
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:39,925
We never did anything to you.

192
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:44,588
And let's keep it that way.
Now scram, crybabies.

193
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:47,737
<i>Bump, bump
Sugarlump, rump!</i>

194
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:07,525
That Babs has really
gone too far this time.

195
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,720
Kicked out of
our own clubhouse.

196
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:11,297
And my own bed.

197
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:12,760
Seriously?

198
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:14,880
Super seriously.

199
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:17,188
We need to talk
to Applejack.

200
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:20,411
No!

201
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,091
- Rarity?
- No!

202
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:23,954
Twilight?

203
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,828
No, no, no.

204
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:28,280
We need to fight back.

205
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,154
Yeah, fight back!

206
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:31,828
How are we gonna do that?

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,051
By making her the guest of honor
at the Summer Harvest Parade.

208
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,577
Yeah! Wait. What?

209
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:46,211
When you look up "embarrassed"
in the dictionary,

210
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:49,331
her face will be there.

211
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,794
Moo!

212
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,685
Moo!

213
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:04,462
Moo!

214
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,028
Moo!

215
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,851
Are those from
the Carousel Boutique?

216
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:25,942
Yep.
Excellent.

217
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:29,160
Ooh!

218
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,794
Luster dust from
Sugercube Corner.

219
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,474
They use it for
decorating cakes.

220
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:37,674
That must be what Rarity uses
on her emergency edible boots.

221
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,314
The gears and bands for
the moving mechanism,

222
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,400
my tools and stuff.

223
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,668
Did you bring the thing?

224
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,034
From the place?

225
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:46,611
What's that?

226
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:49,257
Granny Smith's
kitchen timer.

227
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,948
What's that for?
You'll see. Heh-heh.

228
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,051
Come on, y'all.
Let's get to it.

229
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
We only got a few hours
before morning

230
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,354
and this thing
has to look so good,

231
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:02,617
Babs won't be able to resist
wanting to ride in it.

232
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:37,565
Is this it?

233
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,297
I think we're a go.

234
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,280
Good, because we better get out
of here before Babs finds us.

235
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,405
Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho!

236
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:54,160
Hot carrot crepes!
Get 'em here.

237
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:55,697
Get 'em hot!

238
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,405
Whoa!

239
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:16,342
Isn't it smashing?

240
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:18,520
No, I didn't mean smash.

241
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,114
I mean, isn't it a hit?

242
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:23,200
No, no hit! No hitting.
I mean---

243
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,394
Well, don't even think
about riding it, Babs.

244
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:48,502
You had your chance.

245
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:04,537
See you later,
Cutie Mark Crybabies.

246
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,382
The timer set?

247
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:11,931
Teach her to fool
with the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

248
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,154
Y'all are lettin' Babs ride
in your golden apple float?

249
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:16,537
Yeah.

250
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:21,314
We thought she deserved to be
the center of attention.

251
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:26,565
Well, that's just
super sweet of y'all.

252
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,560
Makin' Babs feel so special.

253
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:31,531
You know after all the heartache she's
been having in Manehattan.

254
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,274
Heartache?

255
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,680
Well, I didn't say nothing because
I didn't want her to feel singled out,

256
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,188
but there's been some bullies
back in Manehattan

257
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:41,650
just been teasin' her to pieces
for her blank flank.

258
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,251
T-T-Teased?

259
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,234
B-Bullies?

260
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,514
Yup.

261
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:49,994
She came out to the farm to get away
from all her problems back home.

262
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:54,497
I'm so proud of y'all.
You done a good deed.

263
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:00,577
So that's why she jumped in when
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon

264
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:02,245
started giving us
a hard time.

265
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:04,417
She didn't want to be
bullied like at home

266
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,177
so she decided to
be a bully instead.

267
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:11,348
And now we've turned
into bullies too.

268
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:15,137
What'll we do?

269
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:21,228
Nice float, Babs.

270
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:24,800
Snagged it from those
whiny-baby blank flanks.

271
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:27,828
Too cool for mule, Babs.

272
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,948
We gotta stop that float.

273
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:40,468
Applejack. Quick, you have--
( band playing loudly )

274
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,485
Huh?
Quick, you have to help us!

275
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,714
What?

276
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:46,948
We booby-trapped it!

277
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,685
Babs. Bully. Payback.
No time to explain.

278
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,548
We've just got to get
Babs out of that float.

279
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:06,971
Oof, my popcorn!
Sorry! Excuse me!

280
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,188
Excuse me. Ow! Whoops.

281
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,731
Pinkie Pie, let us in.

282
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:24,794
Funny joke.

283
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:28,222
No, really.
Let us in!

284
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:29,434
Oh!

285
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:31,102
Here.

286
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:46,102
Babs, you gotta
get out of that float!

287
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:49,200
You're not getting your
float back, crybabies.

288
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:50,725
But it's booby trap--

289
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,148
- Veggie salad!
- Huh?

290
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,474
Veggie salad!

291
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,251
Veggie salad.

292
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:06,314
Seriously?

293
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,148
Hey, don't leave me!

294
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:15,148
Ha-ha! "Leave" me!
Ha-ha-ha!

295
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,182
What the--?

296
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:27,640
Babs!

297
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:31,782
Babs!

298
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,651
Oh, sweet apple sauce!

299
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:55,571
Maybe we'll get our cutie marks
in "Stupidest Ideas of All Time."

300
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,600
Are y'all okay?

301
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,354
Yeah, we're fine.

302
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:03,697
No sweat.

303
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:07,834
After I'd been so mean to you,
you saved me.

304
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,508
Uh, about that...

305
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,617
I don't get it.
I saw it all happen.

306
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:16,828
You pushed me out
just when the float

307
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,205
was about to head
into the lake.

308
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:22,502
Except we were the reason
it was headed into the lake.

309
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,942
We booby-trapped the float.

310
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,325
You see, Babs,

311
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:29,062
we were trying
to get you back

312
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,617
for being a big bully.

313
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,857
But then Applejack told us

314
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:35,640
about how you were being
bullied back in Manehattan.

315
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:37,834
And we figured out
you were just doing it

316
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,131
to avoid getting
picked on in Ponyville.

317
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:43,891
But by then, we were
the ones being bullies.

318
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:44,360
And...

319
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:48,057
Oh, why does life
have to be so ironic?

320
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:50,765
Guess what we're
trying to say is...

321
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:53,348
We're sorry.

322
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:56,794
I'm sorry too.

323
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,771
Ah. You know, this all
could've been avoided

324
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,097
if y'all just came to me
in the very beginning.

325
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:04,788
That's what I
kept on saying.

326
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,365
So can we start over?

327
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,720
Definitely.
Yeah.

328
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,925
We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders,
elect Babs Seed to join us

329
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:39,982
as a sister, friend, confidante,
ally, bosom buddy, gal pal,

330
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,034
compadre, chum of chums--

331
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:45,754
Well, you wrote this.

332
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,668
Oh, uh, yeah.

333
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,954
Homegirl, amiga...

334
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:53,560
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, yes, here.

335
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,617
And fellow
Cutie Mark Crusader!

336
00:19:57,457 --> 00:20:00,394
You are solemnly sworn in
here this day

337
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:02,554
in witness
of your fellow sisters,

338
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:05,137
friends, confidantes,

339
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:07,674
bosom buddies, compadres--

340
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,862
Congratulations !

341
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:10,497
Gotta remember
to revise that.

342
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:21,051
So you promise
you're going to start

343
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:23,817
our Manehattan branch of the
Cutie Mark Crusaders, right?

344
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:26,417
Yeah. And I promise
to keep talking

345
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:29,262
to my big sis about
the teasing back home.

346
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:33,932
Good, and if you have any problems,
we've got your back too, you hear?

347
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:35,651
So you're leaving, huh?

348
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:40,045
Great. Now we're stuck here
with these lame blank flanks.

349
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:45,691
Hey! That's not
how you talk to my friends.

350
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,811
F-Friends??

351
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,177
Yeah, you got a problem
with that?

352
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,925
Well, what if I do?

353
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:54,542
What are you gonna
do about it?

354
00:20:57,342 --> 00:21:00,320
Tell your mothers about
your bad attitudes.

355
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:11,908
I'm sure gonna miss
that bad seed.

356
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:13,554
Bad seed?

357
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:15,302
I thought y'all
were friends now?

358
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:18,680
No, see, first
we called her "Bad Seed,"

359
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,457
as in actually
a "bad seed."

360
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,680
But now she's "bad"
as in "good." Get it?

361
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:25,914
Yeah... No.
