1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,338
You know the worst thing about

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,077
you being the Princess of Friendship?

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,442
The dishes.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,832
Thanks for taking
care of that, Spike.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,533
After three events in one week,

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,810
I really needed to
relax with a good book.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,329
It's kinda funny, isn't it?

8
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:22,580
All these ponies coming to you
for advice about friendship.

9
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:24,350
What's funny about that?

10
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:26,370
Well, you know, cause
you used to be famous

11
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:27,590
for being such a bad friend.

12
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:32,208
What are you talking about? I
had good friends in Canterlot.

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,267
Come on, Twilight,
look at the wall.

14
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:38,030
Do you see any photos from
before we moved to Ponyville?

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,305
And look at you now. The
Princess of Friendship.

16
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,290
This is a disaster!

17
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,960
All my old friends. I can't
remember any of their names

18
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:50,120
right now, but do you
really think that they think

19
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,267
I'm a bad friend?

20
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,253
Well, I only meant that
you've come so far.

21
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:55,780
You're a great friend now and--

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,690
Oh, I feel terrible! I've
got to make it up to them.

23
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,680
Pack a bag, Spike! We're
going to Canterlot!

24
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,107
And make a list of
my friends' names.

25
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,990
Aw, me and my big mouth.

26
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,576
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

27
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:52,603
Come on, Twilight.

28
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:54,060
You're getting worked
up about nothing.

29
00:01:57,298 --> 00:01:59,913
The only logical place to
start is at the beginning.

30
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,750
Whoa...

31
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,458
It's exactly
how we left it.

32
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,987
Look! It's "Predictions
and Prophesies!"

33
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,289
And it's still opened to
the Elements of Harmony!

34
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:25,570
And here's that present I
was gonna give Moondancer!

35
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,840
Eh, guess she won't be needing that.

36
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:30,886
Hey, look! The rest
of it's still here!

37
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,883
How could I have
let this happen?

38
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,473
Come on, Twilight.

39
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,683
Princess Celestia gave
you an assignment.

40
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:44,830
No pony could blame
you for that.

41
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,286
But look at the way
I left this place.

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,784
It's a total mess!

43
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,126
Just like how I
left my friendships.

44
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:56,892
I've got to make it up to-

45
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:01,660
Oh, uh, Minuette,
Twinkleshine, Lemon Hearts,

46
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,680
Lyra Heartstrings,
and Moondancer.

47
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:05,704
Yeah. Them.

48
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:15,740
Spike! Come on!
We've got work to do!

49
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:20,440
Have you been awake all night?

50
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,860
I did a little research
and I think I know

51
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,230
where we can find Minuette.

52
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:25,708
That is one of my
friends, right?

53
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:36,437
Uh, it's not too late to
forget I opened my big mouth.

54
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:39,350
No, Spike. I'm glad you
opened your big mouth.

55
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:41,482
These ponies have
probably been suffering

56
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,400
ever since I left, wondering
why their supposed friend

57
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,042
would treat them so badly.

58
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,005
Minuette?

59
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:54,180
Twilight Sparkle,
you old so-and-so!

60
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,400
What are you doing
here? Hey, Spike!

61
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,130
Look at these wings, huh?

62
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,340
Hey, grab a picture of me
and the Princess, will you?

63
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,258
I tried to tell my coworkers
we used to be friends

64
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:08,053
back when, but they've
never believed me.

65
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:16,760
Wait wait wait; really
fluff 'em up, huh?

66
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:23,000
So what are you doing here?

67
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:24,938
I mean, I know you're
here all the time,

68
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:26,590
but you never come to see me!

69
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,829
Hey! I just had
the greatest idea!

70
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,400
You want to go see Lemon
Hearts and Twinkleshine?

71
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:35,088
Of course! My old friends!

72
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:39,008
It'll be great!
Come on, let's fly!

73
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:40,922
Get it? Heh-heh-heh.

74
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:42,394
This is perfect!

75
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:44,928
I can apologize to all
three of them at once!

76
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:47,568
Let's hope they're not as
traumatized as Minuette.

77
00:04:56,768 --> 00:05:00,790
She did! Twinkleshine
literally spit out her oats

78
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:03,098
when she heard you were the
Princess of Friendship!

79
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:06,670
We saw you at the coronation.
That was some shindig!

80
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:07,770
You did?

81
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,000
Sure! We see you all the time.

82
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,660
You remember our old
friend Lyra, right?

83
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,912
She lives in Ponyville, too.

84
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:17,146
We're always over
there visiting her

85
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,810
or she's coming over here.

86
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:21,792
We've thought about
asking you to join us

87
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:22,680
from time to time,

88
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,376
but we just sorta
figured you'd moved on.

89
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,498
Oh.

90
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,186
So what brings you by, anyway?

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
All those times you've
come back to Canterlot,

92
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:36,330
you've never had
donuts with us before.

93
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,906
Well, uh, you see...

94
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,794
I came to apologize.

95
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,010
For what?

96
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,853
Before I left Canterlot,

97
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,580
I didn't really
appreciate my friends.

98
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:51,242
And that's because I didn't know

99
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,170
how important friendship was.

100
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,555
But I've learned so much
since I moved to Ponyville.

101
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,120
I learned what it means
to be a good friend

102
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,020
and that I certainly wasn't
one to the three of you.

103
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:07,040
So, for all the pain I caused
you, I am truly sorry.

104
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:16,218
Aw, come on, Twilight!

105
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:19,290
Sure, it might've stung a
little bit when you ran off

106
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,498
to Ponyville without
saying goodbye,

107
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:24,210
but it's not like we weren't
used to that from you!

108
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:26,580
Yeah, we didn't
take it personally.

109
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,980
But it's really
good to see you now.

110
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:32,442
Hey! Anypony up for a
blast from the past?

111
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:42,336
It's our old science lab!

112
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,136
I have so many great
memories of this place.

113
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,650
Remember when Lemon
Hearts got her head stuck

114
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:49,780
in that beaker?

115
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,173
...but according to this book,

116
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:04,050
you're supposed to add the
sodium chloride first.

117
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,274
I read ahead and to
make a proper salt lick,

118
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,420
you need to add
the molasses first.

119
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,501
Well, I read ahead
too, Moondancer,

120
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:15,560
and I'm sure it said
sodium chloride first.

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,570
Oh, I've got the wrong
book. That's so hilarious.

122
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,611
Whatever happened to Moondancer?

123
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,740
Moondancer?

124
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,210
Yeah, you know,
our other friend.

125
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:35,280
Oh right, Moondancer!
I remember her!

126
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:37,066
I wonder what she's up to.

127
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,312
Yeah, I always liked her.

128
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,030
We just sort of lost
touch after you left.

129
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:45,530
I think she went to live out
by the stadium, didn't she?

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,874
Well, let's go see!

131
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,370
I think this is the place.

132
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,565
Didn't used to look
like this, though.

133
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,960
Moondancer?

134
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,890
What do you want?
I'm trying to study.

135
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,690
It's us! Your old friends--

136
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:23,920
Ugh!

137
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:31,050
That's old
Moondancer, all right!

138
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:32,840
She always did like her books.

139
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:36,040
Hey, kinda like you
used to be, huh?

140
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:38,346
Exactly how I used to be.

141
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,050
Come on, Twilight, we've been
watching her for three days!

142
00:08:57,274 --> 00:09:00,538
Library, house. Library,
house. That's it.

143
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,986
Nopony looks at
her or says hello

144
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:04,330
or even gives her a smile.

145
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,277
It's like she
doesn't even exist!

146
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,080
Was she always like this?

147
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:09,770
Well, she always
was a little shy.

148
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,792
But for a while there she
was really starting to

149
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,682
come out of her shell.

150
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:14,640
Remember when she
threw that party?

151
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:19,882
Oh,right. I think you might
have been busy that day.

152
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:26,080
There you are, Twilight!

153
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,618
Moondancer is having
a little get-together

154
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,660
in the west castle
courtyard. You wanna come?

155
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:35,541
Ooh, sorry girls. I got a lot
of studying to catch up on.

156
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,898
Thought she might finally
be letting her guard down

157
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:47,050
a little with that party.

158
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:49,765
We invited her out a
few times after that,

159
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:52,218
but she was always
too busy studying.

160
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:55,013
So eventually we
just stopped asking.

161
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:58,128
I had no idea that party
was so important to her.

162
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,965
I've got to find a way
to make it up to her!

163
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,066
Oh my gosh! Moondancer? Is that--?

164
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:25,820
SSSSSHHHHH!

165
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,752
Moondancer? Can I talk
to you for a min--

166
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,253
SSSSSHHH!

167
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:38,197
What is this?

168
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:40,149
Eh, a bubble of silence.

169
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:41,696
I haven't seen
you in a while

170
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,520
and I thought it might
be nice to catch up.

171
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:44,842
For what purpose?

172
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,474
You know. Cause we're friends.

173
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:52,064
SSSSSHHHHH!

174
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,453
I'm really sorry to bother you.

175
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:03,237
I was just hoping we could go
outside and talk for a bit.

176
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,544
I'm sorry I skipped your party.

177
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:13,072
AAH!

178
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,994
SSSSSHHHHH!

179
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:20,688
Why won't you leave me
alone? I'm trying to study!

180
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,941
You've got the wrong pony.
I don't have parties.

181
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,072
You did once.

182
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:27,170
And I was so caught
up in my own studying

183
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:29,072
that I didn't take your
feelings into account.

184
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,114
Look, Twilight Twinkle--

185
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,744
Sparkle.

186
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,517
Whatever. I just need to be
alone so I can study

187
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,573
without some crazy pony trying
to make friends, all right?

188
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:38,672
Fine.

189
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:39,946
Wait.

190
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,538
How did you get into
my book like that?

191
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,293
I've been studying a
new studying technique.

192
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:50,106
I can only do it
for a few minutes,

193
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,053
but you'd be amazed how
much you can pick up

194
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:53,760
when you're
actually in a book!

195
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,552
That's one of Haycart's methods.

196
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:56,837
You know Haycart?

197
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,586
Of course! He's a genius!

198
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,178
I have a copy of his "Treatise
on Ponies," you know.

199
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:07,744
What is this place?

200
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:12,752
This is where I used to live.
You mean I never had you over?

201
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:16,100
A first edition of
"Principles of Magic"!

202
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:18,800
Hey. Didn't I
give this to you?

203
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:21,216
Maybe?

204
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:24,101
I did! Look, I even wrote
something:

205
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:26,373
"To my friend,
Twilight Sparkle.

206
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:28,880
Thanks for introducing
me to the classics."

207
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:31,584
I can see by the fact
that you left it here

208
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,150
that it meant a lot to you.

209
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,301
Look, I didn't
bring you over here

210
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:38,421
for even more poignant reminders
of what a bad friend I was.

211
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,480
I brought you here
to give you this.

212
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,136
You can come here
whenever you want

213
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,072
and study to your
heart's content.

214
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,272
Really?

215
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,525
But first you've got
to do something for me.

216
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:50,800
What?

217
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,173
Have dinner with our
old friends tonight.

218
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:56,677
I can't; I'm reorganizing
my biology scrolls.

219
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,605
I've been spending a lot of time
with Minuette, Twinkleshine,

220
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,496
and Lemon Hearts since I've been
back. They really miss you.

221
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,578
Look, I already told you,
the last thing I need

222
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,264
is a bunch of ridiculous
friend-making

223
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:08,618
keeping me from studying.

224
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:11,504
Moondancer, wait!

225
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:13,413
A wise pony once taught me

226
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,456
that there's more to life
than dusty old books.

227
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:17,962
I tried friendship and
it's just not for me.

228
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,584
Now if you'll excuse me.

229
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,824
What if I taught you
Haycart's method?

230
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,850
So, uh, what are you
studying these days?

231
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:36,346
Science. Magic. History.
Economics. Pottery.

232
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,498
Things like that.

233
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:41,296
Yowza! You plannin' on being
a professor or something?

234
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:42,272
No.

235
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,477
So you're just...studying?

236
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:46,586
Can I go now?

237
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,026
Moondancer, please.

238
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:49,504
It's all right, Twilight.

239
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,325
We're having a good
time. Right, everypony?

240
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,253
So, uh,Spike, tell
Moondancer that story about

241
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:02,128
how Twilight had to read a
book about doing a sleepover.

242
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:04,853
"Slumber 101"? I've read that.

243
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:09,120
Oh, heh-heh, really?
Well, uh, did you know

244
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:12,357
Lemon Hearts here works
at the Canterlot palace?

245
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:15,898
Yeah, it's true. I do
the big events, mostly.

246
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,048
State dinners, that
sort of thing.

247
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,895
Ugh!

248
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,165
Moondancer! You've got to
give friendship a chance!

249
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:37,882
I gave friendship a
chance a long time ago.

250
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:41,210
It didn't work out then. It
isn't going to work out now.

251
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:44,026
Twilight? Are you all right?

252
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,738
No. No, I'm not.

253
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:52,666
Wh-where are you going?

254
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,744
I don't know, Spike, I really
messed this one up.

255
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,920
That party was
everything to her.

256
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:00,304
I can only imagine what
it must have felt like

257
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,792
when I didn't show up.

258
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:09,536
Hey, Moondancer! Look
at this spread, huh?

259
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:11,434
Thank you so much for coming!

260
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:15,456
Of course! We wouldn't miss one
of our best friend's parties!

261
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:17,509
Is Twilight coming?

262
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,990
Oh. OK.

263
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,824
Hey, we'll still
have fun, right?

264
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:32,130
Sure.

265
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,810
If there was only a
way to undo the damage.

266
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:45,701
I know what I need to do.

267
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,058
And I know just who can help me!

268
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:04,378
Huh. Guess they must have
gone back to Ponyville.

269
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:06,949
Wheeee!

270
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:11,360
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

271
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:18,101
That was AWESOME! We gotta go
flying more often, Twilight!

272
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:19,520
There you are!

273
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,610
I thought you threw in the
ol' towel and headed home!

274
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,482
I did head home, but not
to throw in the towel.

275
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:29,330
I went to get my secret
weapon. Minuette, meet--

276
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,221
Hey, Pinkie Pie!

277
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,405
Hi, Minuette!

278
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,773
Twilight, you didn't say
Minuette would be here!

279
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,544
You two know each other?

280
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:41,605
Oh, sure! She was one of
Cadance's bridesmaids.

281
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,866
We hang out all the time
when she's in Ponyville.

282
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:44,933
Didn't you know that?

283
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,832
Hah! And you call yourself
the Princess of Friendship!

284
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,482
Twilight briefed me
on the way here.

285
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:52,640
We'll need fifteen
bags of confetti

286
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,170
and as many hooves
as we can get.

287
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,890
Let's go! We can pass by
the donut place on the way!

288
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,034
And what are we gonna do?

289
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:00,298
Just come with me.

290
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:12,997
Oooh, "A Brief History
of the Wagon Harness"!

291
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:19,904
"The Life and Times of
Marwari the Maneless"?

292
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:39,152
What is this?

293
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,333
It's a party. For you.

294
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,136
SURPRISE!

295
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:48,144
Come on in!

296
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:51,578
Uh, thanks, but no thanks.
I don't do parties.

297
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:57,269
I know. And I think
it's my fault.

298
00:17:57,296 --> 00:17:59,381
Back when we were
in school together,

299
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,970
you invited me to a party.

300
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:03,856
I was so focused on my
studies that I didn't show up.

301
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:05,541
Big deal.

302
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,082
It was a big deal.

303
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,984
And now that I realize how
important friendship is,

304
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:12,794
I'd like to make up for my
mistake with a new party.

305
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:17,660
A party in honor of
my friend, Moondancer!

306
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:21,786
Please, you've got to let
me make this up to you.

307
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:26,458
And you think this is
going to do it, huh?

308
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:28,341
Er, Yes?

309
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,341
Well, sure, why wouldn't it?

310
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:33,525
That was only the first time I
ever put myself out there

311
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:35,936
and then you didn't
even bother to show up!

312
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,410
Then you left town
without saying goodbye,

313
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,634
even though we were
supposed to be friends.

314
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,970
I was humiliated! I felt
like I wasn't important!

315
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:48,336
I never wanted to let myself
be hurt like that again!

316
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,074
Those three finally convinced
me that I had value!

317
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:55,360
That other ponies might like
me and want to be my friend!

318
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:58,448
And YOU! DIDN'T! SHOW! UP!

319
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,090
You're right; this party can't
make up for the way I hurt you.

320
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:17,040
But please, don't let my
mistake be the reason

321
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:19,232
you can't be friends
with anypony else.

322
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,680
We were your friends then,

323
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,405
and we'd be honoured
to be your friends now!

324
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:40,992
What? That's the librarian,
the book seller, my sister!

325
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,840
You've got a lot of
friends, Moondancer.

326
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,536
I'm sorry, Moondancer.

327
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,928
I've faced magical creatures,
the end of Equestria...

328
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
all sorts of things.

329
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:55,320
But seeing how my
actions affected you,

330
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:58,469
that was one of the worst
feelings I've ever had.

331
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:04,490
Thank you, Twilight.

332
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:07,866
I never realized how much
I needed to hear that.

333
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:22,661
Now come on, everypony!
Let's party!

334
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:23,616
Right?

335
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:24,496
Right!

336
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:50,160
I think it's time for
us to go, Moondancer.

337
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:53,189
Thank you for helping me
make some new friends.

338
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,264
Even if they are
my old friends.

339
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:58,570
We'll come back and visit soon.

340
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:00,048
That would be great!

341
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,954
You've still got to teach
me that Haycart technique.

342
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:03,706
Deal.

343
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:07,258
Um, Moondancer? It
got kinda banged up,

344
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,258
but here's a little
something I wanted to give you

345
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:10,336
back at your first party.
