00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,640
I love it when Princess Celestia
comes to Ponyville!

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,400
I got my hooves shined
just like Rarity for the occasion.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,410
- PINKIE: Ya like?
- I certainly do!

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm surprised she's not here yet.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,580
I wonder what's taking so long?

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,500
And where are
Applejack and Fluttershy?

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,300
Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack
with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,380
They'll be along.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,160
I still don't get why
the Princess would be so late.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,270
She's bringing
an important visitor.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,710
That could be part of it.

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,450
A visitor who's important and slow!

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,430
Maybe it's somepony
so terribly important,

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,600
she still had many more terribly important
things to do before she got here.

16
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:43,740
( gasps )

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,900
Maybe the visitor has a deer antler,
a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,200
Yeah, right. That's Discord.

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,000
Why in the
wide-wide world of Equestria

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,820
would Princess Celestia
bring along someone like that?

21
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,320
M-maybe you should ask her!

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,210
With all due respect,
Princess Celestia,

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
( shouting ):
how could you bring Discord here?!

31
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:55,150
( clears throat )

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
( meekly ):
Your majesty.

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,220
I'm fully aware that
the last time Discord was here,

34
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,680
he created serious havoc.

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,770
If by "serious havoc"
you mean turning Ponyville

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,860
into the chaos capital of the world.

37
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,720
And tricking us all into being
the opposite of our true selves.

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,570
And making yummy delicious
chocolate milk rain all over the place,

39
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,790
without a single dollop of whipped cream
to go with it anywhere in sight!

40
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,910
Not a single dollop!

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,200
Yes, I understand.

42
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,100
But I have use for Discord's magic,

43
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,550
if it can be reformed
to serve good instead of evil.

44
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,000
This is why
I've brought Discord here,

45
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,430
because I believe you are the ponies
who can help him do just that.

46
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,550
This will never work!
This is a disaster!

47
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,020
How will we control him?!
We're doomed!

48
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,320
Need I remind you
that you are the ponies

49
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,220
who turned him back into stone
like this in the first place?

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,220
I suppose we can just use
the Elements of Harmony

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,820
against him again
if he gets out of hand...

52
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,910
We probably need a volunteer

53
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,990
to run away from here
right away to get them.

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,480
- I'll do it!
- No need, Spike.

55
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,940
I have them right here.

56
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,420
And I've cast a spell so Discord
can't take them and hide them again.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,070
Now where is Fluttershy?

58
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,620
I believe she may know best
how to begin reforming Discord.

59
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,820
Fluttershy? Really?

60

( chittering )

61
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,120
- What's he goin' on about now?
- Good news!

62
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,870
Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed
to take his dam apart and move it.

63
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,550
Well, it's about time.

64

APPLEJACK:
My apple trees are so waterlogged
I can practically hear 'em gargle!

65
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,460
( indignant beaver sounds )

66
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,570
But he says first you'll have
to apologize for calling him...

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,950
"a nuisance".

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,670
Apologize?! He's lucky
I didn't call him a varmint!

69
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,671
( outraged beaver sounds )

70
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:40,580
Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth!
Such language!

71
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,320
Fine. Fine.

72
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,090
I apologize.

73
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:48,310
( growling )

74
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,170
Whew!
Thanks, Fluttershy.

75
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,970
Don't know what
I would've done without ya.

76
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,290

Hey, slackers!

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,880
Double-time it on over
back to Ponyville, would ya?

I realize that this is a tall order,

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,270
but I wouldn't ask
if I weren't confident

83
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,620
you could get him to use magic
obediently of his own free will.

84
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,860
And you really think
I'll know best how to do that?

85
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,080
I do.

86
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,160
Now, I must return to Canterlot
for Equestria's royal summit.

87
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,680
You may release Discord when ready.

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,380
Okay, ponies,
guess it's time to get started.

89
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,550
Let's just hope
this releasing spell works.

90
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,940
Or... let's not.

91
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,610

We'd best keep our elements on
at all times until further notice.

Being turned to stone doesn't keep me
from hearing every word Celestia says.

Although I admit
it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.

Well, unless you want us
to turn you back to stone,

you'll zap those animals back

it was for a good reason!

Hm.

137

we have to act the same way.

could be as considerate...

Don't listen to him, Fluttershy!

155
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,130
He's just trying to drive a wedge
between us, like he always does.

Now why in the world would
I ever try to do a thing like that?

of Harmony against you, that's why!

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,300
I never thought of that...

159
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,000
RAINBOW DASH:
You big liar!

160
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,730
DISCORD:
Now, look who's a liar.

161
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,340
Anyone can plainly see
that I'm not big at all.

162
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,830
Oops.

163
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,760
There, all better.

164
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,280
I can't watch...

165
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,990
We'll be outside.

166
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,620
You sure you're okay with this?

167
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,840
I know it's not gonna be easy,
but Princess Celestia's counting on me.

168
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,600
And I think
I actually know what to do.

169
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,340
You do?

170
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,990
I think the key is to befriend him.

171
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,760
Being kind to him and letting him
be my house guest

172
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,790
is probably
the best way to do that.

173
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,910
- And you really think that'll work?
- I think it's worth a try.

174
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,760
Okay, but if you need us,
all you need to do is whisper "help",

175
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,990
and we'll be back here
with our Elements.

176
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,390
So watch that
goat-legged step of yours, pal!

177
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,530
What?! Look at me!
I'm practically reformed already.

178
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,740
She's really alright
with him staying there?

179
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,970
That's what she said.

180
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,490
Personally, I think we should
come up with a backup plan,

181
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,580
in case this whole "befriending"
business doesn't work out.

182
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,940
Rainbow Dash is right.

183
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,880
This is Discord we're talking about,
girls.

184
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,270
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to have another trick up our sleeves.

185
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,600
And I think I know just the trick.

186
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,350
Discord? Oh, there you are.

187
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,450
Listen, Discord, I just want
to make sure you know that

188
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,180
if there's anything I can do to--

189
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,560
Uh, um--

190
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,070
Are you eating... paper?

191
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,090
Am I? Huh.
How odd of me.

192
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,300
Well, um...

193
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm just heading out, so,
make yourself at home while I'm gone.

194
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,210
DISCORD:
Bye-bye, have a nice time!

195
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,010
Everything is fine here, bye bye...

196
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,840
DISCORD:
You like carrots, Angel?

197
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,350
I'm playing your owner
for a fool. Ha, ha.

198
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,370
How d'ya like them carrots?

199
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,371
( screams )

200
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,410
That's weird.
The spell I had in mind isn't in here.

201
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,090
Spike, where are the other books
I asked you to pull?

202
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,290
Right here, Twilight.

203
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,420
I really want to have a
reforming spell up and running pronto.

204
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,440
But what if he makes the
Elements of Harmony disappear

205
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,830
like he did last time?

206
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,960
Princess Celestia cast a spell
protecting them, remember?

207
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:10,440
Uh-oh.

208
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,200
What's wrong?

209
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,490
Princess Celestia didn't cast a spell
protecting our books!

210
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,000
Everywhere I thought
I'd find the reforming spell--

211
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,550
Are you sure
this isn't overdoing?

212
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,790
You said to make myself at home
while you were gone,

213
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,560
but I wouldn't want
to overstep my bounds.

214
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,540
I did say that, so...

215
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,060
if this makes you more comfortable,
by all means, please feel free.

216
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,190
Well, it does, very much so.

217
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,240
You're so very kind,
my dear Fluttershy.

218
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,790
I always knew that you were
the understanding one,

219
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,650
not like those nasty friends of yours.

220
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,000
My friends aren't nasty!

221
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,930
Of course you'd say that,

222
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,190
it just goes to show
how understanding you truly are.

223
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,940
You know,
I think Princess Celestia is right

224
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,300
when she singles you out
as the one who could reform me.

225
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,100
You're off to such a good start
I'm seriously considering actually

226
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,070
being reformed.

227
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,340
TWILIGHT ( distant ):
Fluttershy! Fluttershy,
can you hear me?!

228
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,440
Goodness! I hear Twilight!

229
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,980
TWILIGHT:
Fluttershy, what's going on?
Are you okay?!

230
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,521
We're fine,
everything's going great.

231
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,160
Isn't it, Angel?

232
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,300
We've come to get you away
from Discord!

233
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,490
He's just terrible and,
from the looks of it,

234
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,220
completely out of control!

235
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,090
Oh, but you're wrong!
We're making great progress!

236
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,930
TWILIGHT & SPIKE:
Seriously?!

237
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,900
I'm earning his trust by giving him
a little space to be himself.

238
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,500
Hate to break it to you,
but he used that "space to be himself"

239
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,850
to tear out all the reforming spells
from the library!

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,850
That does explain the paper eating...

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,820
He ate them?!

242
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,300
( groans )

243
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,100
But we aren't gonna need a spell.

244
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,740
He's already really
considering being reformed!

245
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,870
He said so.

246
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,330
And you believed him?!

247
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,340
If I'm going to be his friend,
I have to start by giving him

248
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,540
the benefit of the doubt!

249
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,120
Tell you what. Bring all the ponies over
for a dinner party this evening,

250
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,340
and I bet his manners
will have really improved by then.

251
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,420
I'll even get him to put the cottage
back on the ground first.

252
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,940
( sighs )
Alright. Dinner it is...

253
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:30,530
Ugh. I can't believe we're having
a dinner party with Discord!

254
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,890
This evening is sure
to be a disaster.

255
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,520
Glad I didn't bother wearing
my fanciest outfit.

256
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,190
Fluttershy thinks this is the way
to reform Discord

257
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,990
and asked us
to give it a chance.

258
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,840
Oh, our pony guests!

259
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,750
We're so delighted
that you've come.

260
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,530
Please, do come in.

261
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,330
FLUTTERSHY:
See what a beautiful job
he did helping?

262
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,240
Discord set the entire table himself.

263
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,850
I'm so proud.

264
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,720
May I take your--
Ahem, hats, ladies?

265
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,840
Hang on to your elements, girls.
It's gonna be a bumpy night.

266
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,790
As you all know,
Princess Celestia hoped

267
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,030
we'd help Discord use his magic
for good, instead of evil.

268
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,900
FLUTTERSHY:
Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?

269
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,870
You bet!

270
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,790
Allow me.

271
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,891
( panting, whimpers )

272
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,840
Ooh, what a cute little
gravy boat you are!

273
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,270
Yes you are! Yes you are!

274
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,880
That's one creepy little
gravy boat if you ask me.

275
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,710
Oh, come on now, Dashie,
you're not even giving this a chance.

276
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,550
Hey! That's hot!

277
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,210
Whoops! I'm so sorry!

278
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,770
He did that on purpose!

279
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,190
I don't know about that.
Mistakes happen.

280
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,230
Oh, look, everypony,
dancing candles!

281
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,630
I'm not falling for that!

282
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,290
Discord's just trying
to distract us from--

283
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,540
Hey! Knock it off!

284
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,410
I suppose that's another "mistake"?

285
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,360
No, I think you just made them mad.

286
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,430
There's something fishy going on.

287
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,180
Discord!

288
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,430
Well it's hardly my fault
if the soup tureen

289
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,380
finds the term "something fishy"
to be offensive.

290
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,400
Not the dress. Not the dress!

291
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,060
That tureen's only doin'
what you're makin' it do!

292
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,780
Now let's not jump
to any conclusions.

293
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,870
Fluttershy,
can't you see what he's doing?

294
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,490
He's playing innocent with you
so you'll never agree to use

295
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,860
the Elements of Harmony
against him!

296
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,700
Well, that's a bit harsh,
isn't it?

297
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,820
You see what I'm saying,
right, Fluttershy?

298
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,500
Fluttershy!

299
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,790
You know what I see?

300
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,200
I see that
Discord's far from perfect,

301
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,910
but I also see none of you
giving him a chance!

302
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:55,790
PONIES:
Come on!

303
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,350
What's gotten into you?!

304
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,540
Why do you keep cutting him
so much slack?!

305
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,270
Because that's what friends do.

306
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
( softly ):
We're friends?

307
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,240
Why, of course!

308
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,340
I can't ever remember my house being
this lively before you came along.

309
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,340
Oh. Well, I've...
never really had a friend before.

310
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,140
Well now you do!

311
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,200
Now is not a good time, Angel.
We're having a dinner party.

312
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,110
APPLEJACK:
Hold up! I think he's tryin'
to tell us somethin'!

313
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,490
ALL:
Apple!

314
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,040
ALL:
Applejack!

315
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:41,740
Oh, oh, oh!
Sweet Apple Acres?

316
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,440
Flooding at Sweet Apple Acres!

317
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,920
And we all know who's
behind that now, don't we?!

318
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,420
Who, me?

319
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,000
RAINBOW DASH:
Oh, give it a rest!

320
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,380
What do you think of your
"friend" now, Fluttershy?

321
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:56,945
<i>( suspensful music playing )</i>

322
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,490
APPLEJACK:
I've never seen
the floodin' this bad!

323
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,020
They've built dams round here before,
but never like this!

324
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,750
What's goin' on?

325
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:08,900
( angry chatter )

326
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,990
FLUTTERSHY:
( gasp ) Such language!

327
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,840
It's no use.
They won't listen to a word I say!

328
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,290
You see Discord's
behind all this, right?

329
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,150
Oh, of course I do!

330
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,640
Do you all think I'm a silly,
gullible fool?!

331
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,340
PONIES:
Oh, no, well, not exactly.

332
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,400
I've just been trying to gain
his friendship any way I can,

333
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,000
so he'd come to trust
and listen to me!

334
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,050
DISCORD:
Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn?
The water's great!

335
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,500
Time to see if it worked.

336
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,550
Fluttershy, there you are.

337
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,490
A sight for sore eyes.

338
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,670
As you can see, there's a big mess
down here at Sweet Apple Acres.

339
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,700
Oh yes, awful business
that, mm-hm.

340
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,550
It is awful.

341
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,200
This is Applejack's home,
and it's being destroyed

342
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,800
by innocent creatures
who would never be acting this way

343
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,670
if it weren't for
your reckless behavior.

344
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,100
You need to fix this.

345
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,050
Very well, I will fix it.
I only ask one thing in return.

346
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes?

347
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,180
I ask that you never use
your Element of Harmony against me.

348
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,160
As a sign of our friendship.

349
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,370
I will never use
my Element of Harmony against you.

350
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,140
Excellent!

351
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,050
DISCORD:
There, much better!

352
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,350
I do prefer ice skating
to water skiing! Don't you?

353
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,020
( shouting ) :
Discord!

354
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,270
That's not fixing it!

355
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,190
Why I ought to--

356
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,070
Where are you going?

357
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,560
- What's wrong, pal?
- Don't call me your pal!

358
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,900
Come skating with me,
and we'll let bygones be bygones.

359
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,380
Here you go, Fluttershy!
Game on!

360
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,120
He fixes this or
he goes back to being stone!

361
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,510
TWILIGHT:
Princess Celestia will understand!

362
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,000
I made a promise not to use
my element against him

363
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,550
and I'm going to keep it.

364
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,236
( groans )

365
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,380
Ha, ha! You see?

366
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,320
She wants to have fun with me
because we're friends.

367
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,810
She can't use the elements against me
because we're friends.

368
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,663
I'm free forever,
ha, ha, ha!

369
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,060
Not! Your! Friend!

370
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,550
Who cares?

371
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want.

372
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,610
I'm Discord, the master of chaos!

373
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,510
You think
you can boss Discord around?

374
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,050
You think I'm just going to
turn all this back because you say so?

375
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,390
Because if I don't
I'll lose the one friend I ever had?

376
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:00,906
Oh...

377
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,450
Well played, Fluttershy.

378
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,610
Well played.

379
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:25,510
<i>( triumphant music playing )</i>

380
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,120
PONIES:
Woo-hoo!
All right, Fluttershy!

381
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,530
I liked it better my way, but...
I guess when you're friends,

382
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,600
you can't always have things
exactly your way all the time, eh?

383
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,920
DISCORD:
Yes, Princess,
I'm ready to use my magic

384
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,710
for good instead of evil.

385
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,320
( muttering ):
Most of the time.

386
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,050
PRINCESS CELESTIA:
Congratulations
on your success, ponies.

387
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,570
I definitely sense
a big change in Discord.

388
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,050
I'll leave the Elements of Harmony
with you, Twilight.

389
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,970
Just in case.

390
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,510
You were right
when you said Fluttershy

391
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,330
would be the one to find
the way to reform Discord.

392
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,130
By treating Discord as a friend,

393
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,240
she got him to realize
that friendship

394
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,420
was actually important to him.

395
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,010
And something that, once he had,
he didn't want to lose.

396
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,300
Go on. Say it...

397
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,780
( rushing ):
Alright...
Friendship is magic!

398
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,670
See?
He can be a real sweetheart

399
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,510
once you get to know him.
