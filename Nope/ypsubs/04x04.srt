1
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:14,419
Four more months.

2
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:15,295
Four more months.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,302
Four more months.

4
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:17,914
I bet you're excited, huh?

5
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:20,222
Oh, my, I uh...

6
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:21,459
I could be excited.

7
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:22,454
I don't really know.

8
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:23,484
I wasn't really thinking...

9
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:24,983
Come on. You gotta
be excited.

10
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:27,116
Oh, well, I guess
maybe I'm a little,

11
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:28,634
kind of sort of excited...

12
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:29,888
I thought so.

13
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,882
Yeah. So, um...

14
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:33,633
why am I excited?

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,734
Because the next Daring Do
book is coming out

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,767
exactly four months from today!

17
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:40,040
THAT'S how exciting it is!

18
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:43,067
So what amazing, incredible,
awesome adventure

19
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:45,221
do you think Daring Do will
have in her next book, huh?

20
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,589
<i>Will she at long last</i>
<i>stalk the Fortress of Talocan?</i>

21
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:51,773
<i>Only to be forced to</i>
<i>contend with its dreaded</i>

22
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,654
<i>and impenetrable</i>
<i>arrow defense?</i>

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>And if so, could her skill,</i>
<i>quick wits and courage</i>

24
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,120
<i>possibly carry the day?</i>

25
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:03,096
<i>Or will her next adventure</i>
<i>bring her face-to-face</i>

26
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:06,400
<i>with the vast and</i>
<i>horrible Ahuizotl himself?</i>

27
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:10,864
<i>Would she cower?</i>

28
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:11,931
<i>Turn tail and run?</i>

29
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:14,421
<i>Or would she fly at</i>
<i>him full bore,</i>

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,524
<i>knowing full well</i>
<i>against all odds</i>

31
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,961
<i>that the greatest challenge</i>
<i>she'd ever faced</i>

32
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:20,979
<i>was still sure to</i>
<i>be no match for--</i>

33
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,595
<i>Look out!</i>

34
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,954
Oh, I'm not so sure she's going
to last another four months.

35

36
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:10,671
Three months and
twenty-six days.

37
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,124
Three months and
twenty-six days!

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,750
Three months and
twenty-six days!

39
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,772
Hey Twilight, aren't
you excited that--

40
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,507
So glad you finally made it!

41
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,742
What's everypony doing here?

42
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,744
We're having a holiday party.

43
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,915
So what holiday would today be?

44
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,095
National Random
Holiday Party Day.

45
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:33,516
Whoo hoo!

46
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,320
I'd never heard of it either.

47
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,289
But the punch is quite tasty.

48
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,588
You might say the
secret ingredient is...

49
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,444
A secret.

50
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:45,683
How come nopony
bothered to invite me?

51
00:02:45,863 --> 00:02:47,750
I came to invite you personally.

52
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:50,440
But it seems you were
a speck too busy

53
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:53,974
reading the last Daring Do
book for the twelfth time.

54
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,132
Yeah, well, in three months
and twenty-six more days

55
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:57,826
I'll be able to read
the next one.

56
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,334
Oh, haven't you heard?

57
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:02,076
The release of the next book
got pushed another two months.

58
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,015
Two more months?!

59
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,323
I've been waiting
so long already,

60
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:10,284
I don't think I can take
another two months!

61
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,385
I'll never make it!

62
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,368
Yeah, I can vouch
for that.

63
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,663
Did they give a reason?

64
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:19,843
The publisher just said
author A.K. Yearling

65
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:22,039
won't be able to finish the
book for another two months.

66
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:23,176
Cupcakes?

67
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,573
How could you possibly
know that before me?

68
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,520
I'm the series' biggest fan!

69
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:31,441
I'm just as big a fan as you.

70
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:34,126
In fact, I'm the one who first
introduced you to the books.

71
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:35,026
Remember?

72
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:36,316
Oh. Right.

73
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:38,868
A.K. Yearling just might
be my favorite author.

74
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,579
I know everything about her.

75
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:41,566
Where she grew up.

76
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,135
Where she studied literature.

77
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:45,324
Where she wrote
the first Daring Do book...

78
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:46,915
Where she lives?

79
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,433
Uh, no...

80
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:51,223
though I could probably
find out somehow.

81
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:51,986
Why?

82
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:53,356
Don't you get it?

83
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:56,444
The new book is obviously
delayed because she needs help

84
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:59,186
dealing with whatever everyday
nonsense is distracting her

85
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,236
from spending her every living
breathing second writing!

86
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:05,642
So I...I mean fans like me,

87
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:07,486
can get to read the
next book ASAP!

88
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:08,478
Think about it.

89
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,681
We could help her with her
laundry, buying her groceries,

90
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:12,653
cooking her meals.

91
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,254
Whatever.

92
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,666
Now who wouldn't
appreciate that?

93
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,775
Hmm, I don't know.

94
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,911
What she probably wants most of
all is respect for her privacy.

95
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,645
She can always just say no.

96
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,032
Mmh... I suppose you're right.

97
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:30,517
Of course I am.

98
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,101
So how's about
getting that address?

99
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:50,202
You see what I mean?

100
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:52,684
Why would she live in this
remote part of Equestria

101
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:55,521
except to keep folks from
intruding on her privacy?

102
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,515
We should respect--

103
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,884
I think I spotted
the house!

104
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,059
We're super-close.

105
00:04:59,073 --> 00:04:59,820
This way!

106
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,529
Wait!

107
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:05,131
Oh no!

108
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:06,444
What happened?

109
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,766
<i>Apparently, somepony has intruded</i>

110
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:11,229
<i>on her privacy</i>
<i>pretty hard already.</i>

111
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,550
<i>Ooowee. Somepony really</i>
<i>trashed this place.</i>

112
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:25,373
Hmm. Maybe.

113
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:26,653
<i>Or...</i>

114
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,583
maybe A.K. Yearling's just
a terrible, horrible,

115
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,165
unbelievable slob.

116
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,475
I hope A.K.
Yearling's all right.

117
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:36,124
Oh no! What if something
terrible happened to her?

118
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:38,852
I know! There might
be no more books!

119
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,783
Uh, but of course I'd be
worried about her, too. Heh.

120
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,676
What are you all doing here?

121
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:51,510
Uh..A...K...Yearling?

122
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,875
We didn't do
this; we swear!

123
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:58,505
What have you done to my house?

124
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,054
We didn't do this,
Ms. Yearling.

125
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,481
Agh!

126
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:04,382
We're awfully glad to
see you're all right.

127
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,501
OK, clearly this
isn't the best time,

128
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,805
but I just gotta say how much
we all really love your books.

129
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:15,775
Heh heh.

130
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,890
Ah. It's safe.

131
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:33,943
Great!

132
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,922
Maybe now would be a good
time for me to ask her

133
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,933
how we can help move the
new book along a little faster.

134
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:41,002
Chop chop.

135
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:45,036
Rainbow Dash, a
minute please.

136
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,805
A.K. Yearling has
made it pretty clear

137
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:50,378
that she wants to
be left alone.

138
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,489
We need to respect
her wishes.

139
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:55,057
You should tell that
to those guys.

140
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,251
A.K. Yearling IS Daring Do!

141
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:29,551
<i>A.K. Yearling and Daring Do</i>
<i>are one-and-the-same.</i>

142
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:31,972
My mind is officially blown.

143
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:34,870
Aw, come on. I knew
it all along.

144
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:40,144
Amazing.

145
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,228
Incredible.

146
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,610
<i>Wow! So much action!</i>

147
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:01,680
<i>Wheeeeeee!</i>

148
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:05,028
Daring Do!

149
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,996
Many thanks, Daring Do.

150
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:22,485
As you probably surmised, our
earlier search for this treasure

151
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:24,655
was unsuccessful.

152
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:27,818
So kind of you to
find it for us.

153
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:32,040
Give it back, Caballeron!

154
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,244
That's Dr. Caballeron to you!

155
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,927
He's from Book 4: Daring
Do and the Razor of Dreams.

156
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:39,943
He wanted to partner with
Daring Do on her adventures.

157
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,652
I know. But she
refused.

158
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,651
I can't believe it.

159
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:45,586
The real Daring Do and
the real Caballeron!

160
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,819
So let me guess:
Ahuizotl has put you up to this.

161
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,178
You're stealing the
ring to give to him

162
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,211
so his hold on the
Fortress of Talocan

163
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,723
will be good
for Eight Centuries

164
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:55,972
as foretold by prophesy.

165
00:08:56,056 --> 00:08:56,897
Close...

166
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:58,575
but no.

167
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:01,346
I'm going to sell this
to him, make a bundle

168
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:04,304
<i>and retire from</i>
<i>archeology in splendor.</i>

169
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:07,736
Caballeron, you fool!

170
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,083
You're dooming the valley
to eight centuries

171
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,720
of unrelenting heat!

172
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,658
To market, henchponies.

173
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,593
Uh... should we go in
and help her maybe?

174
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,361
Oh. Right!

175
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,645
Are you OK?

176
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:27,802
I've got this.

177
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,979
Um... She was just
trying to help, Ms. Do.

178
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:32,641
Daring Do doesn't need help.

179
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,073
She handles her
business herself.

180
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:40,743
<i>We've got to go help!</i>

181
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:43,902
You heard her. She
says she works alone.

182
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,421
How can we just stand
by and do nothing?

183
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:47,769
You know what's at stake here?

184
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:50,349
Ahuizotl has sought control
of the Tenochtitlan Basin

185
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:51,496
since Book 3.

186
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,723
True, but in Book 4,
she defeated Ahuizotl

187
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:56,762
and secured control of the
Amulet of Atonement,

188
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:59,287
dispelling the dark magic
of the Ketztwctl Empress

189
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:00,509
and thus protecting the basin

190
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:01,996
with the Radiant
Shield of Razdon.

191
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,492
But the Radiant
Shield of Razdon

192
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,835
is vulnerable to the
dark enchantment

193
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:06,040
of the Rings of Scorchero.

194
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,959
But are you forgetting that
the rings were scattered

195
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,717
to the four corners of
Tenochtitlan,

196
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:11,845
thus rendering the dark
enchantment powerless?

197
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,993
Only if you assume that the
rings have yet to be retrieved

198
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,507
and the ring
Caballeron just stole

199
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,727
isn't the last to completely
restore the dark tower

200
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,887
and its cruel hold
on Tenochtitlan.

201
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:21,939
Did you ever think of that?

202
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:25,092
You gotta admit, Rainbow
Dash makes a pretty good point.

203
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:27,194
We've gotta help Daring
Do retrieve the ring

204
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:29,182
for safekeeping
before it's too late.

205
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:33,623
OK. But sounds to me
like we're in way way way

206
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,610
over our heads.

207
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:37,461
We're going to need a
carefully thought out plan.

208
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:39,832
<i>I'm coming,</i>
<i>Daring Do!</i>

209
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,184
That's not a plan!

210
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:45,080
Come on, come on, come on!

211
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:48,214
<i>Bingo!</i>

212
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:50,019
Here I come, Daring Do.

213
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:53,184
To join in adventure with
the greatest, bravest, coolest,

214
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,069
most incredible hero
I could ever...

215
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:01,521
OK, maybe I just need a sec.

216
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:04,977
Just another adventure.

217
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:06,288
No big deal.

218
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:09,239
Get a grip!

219
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:10,620
I got this.

220
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:14,431
Though doing it
alongside Daring Do?

221
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,178
Wow, maybe I could get my
picture taken with her.

222
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:17,939
Or an autograph.

223
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:20,554
There you go again.

224
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:23,053
She's just a pony like
any other pony.

225
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:26,958
A pony who stops entire
armies of bad guys

226
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,887
with nothing more than
her bare hooves

227
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:30,300
and an attitude and

228
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:32,119
Ow.

229
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,800
Ow... That's starting to hurt.

230
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,505
Aargh!

231
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,287
Ow!

232
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:38,946
Stop!

233
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,468
Oh. It's just you.

234
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:43,326
Wait, don't go!

235
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:49,840
Think fast. This is your
big chance to impress her

236
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:51,342
with your quick wit and courage.

237
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:02,640
I am suuuuch a huge fan.

238
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:05,295
Heh heh heh heh.

239
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:08,450
Wait, wait, wait.

240
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,315
Let me help you.

241
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,707
I promise I can be
a huge, huge help

242
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,172
if you just give
me a chance.

243
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,222
I...

244
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:15,180
Work...

245
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,384
Alone.

246
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:20,222
But why won't you let me
team up with you just this once?

247
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,208
My work always
involves secrets,

248
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:24,341
and since you never know
who you can trust,

249
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,915
it's best never to
trust anypony.

250
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,047
But just because you
can't trust some

251
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:31,229
doesn't mean nopony
can be trusted.

252
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:33,205
Look, I don't have
time to argue.

253
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:34,323
Neither do I. Let's go!

254
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,428
I can't believe I'm
even talking to her.

255
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:48,729
Looks like they decided
to have an early dinner

256
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,214
before making their way
back down the hill

257
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,502
to the marketplace in town.

258
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,096
Oh, I see! You're
going to ambush them

259
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,088
like you did in Book 4
at the Horavian Caves.

260
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,453
Or maybe that neat
trick you did in Book 3

261
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,159
where you swoop in and
knock three guys down

262
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,930
with one swing. Or maybe...

263
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,972
OK. I'll be quiet now.

264
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:11,482
Just watching very
quietly. Shh.

265
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,755
So what kind of ambush
are you gonna use then?

266
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,364
Wow!

267
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,607
I have been led to believe

268
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:26,852
you have in
your possession

269
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:29,242
an item of significant
importance

270
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,207
that might be for sale.

271
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:35,473
Oh, um, well, I did have
another buyer lined up.

272
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,131
But he's not here, so...

273
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,463
sounds like we have a deal.

274
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:44,591
Caballeron!

275
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,391
Ahuizotl!

276
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,475
The ring!

277
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,039
Be cool, Rainbow Dash, be cool.

278
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,695
She's got this.

279
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:03,656
The ring, Daring Do.

280
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:05,221
Give it to me.

281
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:09,703
Now Ahuizotl, you know
I love you,

282
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:13,539
but I can't give you the ring
till I've properly proposed.

283
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,949
Interesting.

284
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:21,691
Because my friends here
have a proposal of their own.

285
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:25,863
Meow!

286
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:34,357
Bring it!

287
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,809
Come on, Daring Do, come on!

288
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:56,193
Daring Do. I've got your hat!

289
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:57,410
Want me to toss it?

290
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,452
Daring Do! DARING DO!

291
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,237
<i>Aaaaahh!</i>

292
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:15,252
Don't worry, Daring Do.

293
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:16,720
I'll come help you!

294
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:17,777
Whoa!

295
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:20,195
Don't bother.

296
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,594
I'd say you've already
"helped" plenty.

297
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:27,432
What have I done?

298
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:35,734
<i>Oh, thank goodness</i>
<i>you're all right.</i>

299
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,336
Quick. Where does it hurt?

300
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:39,375
In here.

301
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:43,135
Daring Do and the ring have been
captured by the dreaded Ahuizotl

302
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:45,303
and it's all my fault.

303
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:50,033
Dash, I'm sure whatever
you did was an honest mistake.

304
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,391
Whatever.

305
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,595
Let's just go home.

306
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,325
We can't go back now!

307
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:56,852
Looks a might like she
needs our help more than ever.

308
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,640
Trying to help is how I got
in this mess in the first place.

309
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:02,640
You were right, Twilight.

310
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,417
We should've stayed out of this.

311
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,615
Look, there's more going
on here than meets the eye.

312
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:10,136
In every Daring Do book
there always is.

313
00:16:10,357 --> 00:16:12,064
We can't turn our backs on her.

314
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:14,655
She doesn't want
my help, Twilight.

315
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:15,990
Perhaps.

316
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:17,908
But she might
need it anyway.

317
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,280
No. My hero's way
better off without me.

318
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,194
This don't
sound like you.

319
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,424
Where's the Rainbow Dash
who would help anypony

320
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:26,530
at the drop of a hat?

321
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:28,819
Or pith helmet, as
the case may be.

322
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,693
She's here, where she's
got no business being.

323
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:33,510
She should be at home.

324
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:36,745
It's fine to look up
to Daring Do,

325
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:39,102
but you've put her
so high up on a pedestal

326
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,406
you can't even see your
own worth anymore.

327
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:44,241
She's in the fortress
and we're here.

328
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:47,213
And we wouldn't be who we are
if we didn't go in after her.

329
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,079
<i>And neither would you.</i>

330
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:52,591
So are you with us or not?

331
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:16,725
Surrender now, Ahuizotl, or
I'll be forced to take you down.

332
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:25,980
Oh, Daring Do, I will so miss
your amusing laughter-jokes.

333
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:29,752
Now I must leave to commence
the ring-placing ceremony

334
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:35,869
to unleash 800 years of
unrelenting sweltering heat.

335
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:09,469
Gotcha!

336
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,087
You can flap too, you know.

337
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:20,958
I was just about to save
myself, you know.

338
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,187
Of course.

339
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,552
I just thought you
might need this.

340
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,247
Have I mentioned yet
that I work alone?

341
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:33,344
Have I mentioned yet that
you're lucky I don't?

342
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:52,934
Drop the ring,
Huiz-whatever-your-name-is.

343
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:55,508
Place the ring, quickly!

344
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,581
Get it!

345
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:19,715
Come with me.

346
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:24,692
Help me get all these rings off.

347
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:36,741
If we can remove the giant
ring at the bottom,

348
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:38,899
the whole fortress
will collapse.

349
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,419
Was this your
plan all along?

350
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:44,788
I had to find a way to
get into the fortress.

351
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:47,812
You did it on purpose?
But I thought--

352
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,276
Didn't count on how heavy
this ring would be, though.

353
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,005
Guess having a little
help can be handy sometimes.

354
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:07,666
Stop her!

355
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:13,691
You can flap too, you know.

356
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,952
Ponies! Run! This place
is going down!

357
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,431
Daring Do!

358
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,650
I will have my revenge!

359
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,585
Could never have done this
without you, Rainbow Dash.

360
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,457
I've got a book to finish!

361
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,394
<i>Just had the coolest adventure</i>
<i>with the coolest pony ever.</i>

362
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:02,881
<i>Came this close to blowing it</i>
<i>because I got so wrapped up</i>

363
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:06,290
<i>in how awesome she was, I</i>
<i>almost forgot how awesome I was.</i>

364
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,650
Good thing I didn't, 'cause it
gave me a chance to show her

365
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,357
how important it is to put
your trust in somepony else.

366
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,030
Package from A.K. Yearling.

367
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:20,222
Sweet!

368
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:23,229
The new book a week
before anypony else gets it.

369
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,280
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my GOSH!
