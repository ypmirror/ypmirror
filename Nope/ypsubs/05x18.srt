No! We've tried everything!

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,857
We've run out of ideas.

00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:16,914

Cutie Mark Crusaders! HELP!

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,320
What's wrong, Pip Squeak?

19
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm running for
Student Pony President!

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,820
I was hoping you three would
be my campaign managers.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,730
We've never tried getting our
Cutie Marks in campaign managing

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,720
What do you say, Crusaders?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600
YEAH! HA!

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:35,620

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,420
So, Pip? How would
you help the school

26
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,580
if you were elected
Student Pony President?

27
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,400
Our playground equipment
took quite a beating

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
during Twilight's
battle with Tirek!

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,500
If I'm voted in as
Student Pony President,

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,400
I'll go to the School
Board and right this wrong!

31
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,838
(cheers)

32
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,920
Well, I think that's a
ridiculous waste of money.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,140
It's just like when Twist
proposed to repair the window

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,620
that Discord destroyed.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,480
She just wanted
to repair it

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,260
like a plain old
schoolhouse window!

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,320
But you all know voting
for me was the best choice

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,380
because I convinced
the School Board

39
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,260
to give that window
visual appeal!

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,960
'Course it doesn't hurt that
her mother, Spoiled Rich,

41
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,220
is President of
the School Board!

42
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,660
Exactly! Which is why when
Diamond Tiara is voted

43
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,200
Student Pony President,

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,660
the school will be
putting a statue of her

45
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,140
in the center of our schoolyard!

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,320
Silver Spoon! That was my big
announcement for when I won!

47
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,860
I was only
trying to help.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,600
I don't need that
kind of help.

49
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,400
Haven't we all had
enough of Diamond Tiara?

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,520
Do we really need a
big statue of her?

51
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,260
Especially where our playground
equipment should be?

52
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,900
A vote for Pip is a
vote for the playground!

53
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,080

Huh?

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,780
Oh, my gosh, Crusaders! Pip won!

113
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,020
I couldn't have won
without the hard work

114
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,400
of my campaign managers,
the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

115
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,520
Campaign Manager Cutie Marks!

116
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,340
Guess you're not as good as
you thought, Blank Flanks!

117
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,160
In fact, I demand a recount!

118
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,940
Trust me, Diamond
Tiara. Pip won.

119
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,780
I'll be the judge of
that, Miss Cheerilee!

120
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,180
WHAAAAAAAAT??!

121
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,460
ONE VOTE?

122
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,840
SILVER SPOON? YOU
didn't vote for me?

123
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,220
No, I didn't!

124
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,080
But you're my best friend!

125
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,840
Am I? Cause I tried
to help by mentioning

126
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,420
your "surprise statue"

127
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,420
and suddenly I wasn't
even allowed to speak!

128
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,700
You could have actually
won this election

129
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,780
if you'd just listened to
me. You wanna know how?

130
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,020
Sorry. I'm not
allowed to speak.

131
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,360
What? I don't have to
follow her drama anymore.

132
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,120
I know Diamond Tiara's
been pretty awful,

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,660
but we should probably
make sure she's OK.

134
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,680
Just 'cause she's never cared
about anypony else's feelings

135
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,780
doesn't mean we shouldn't
care about hers.

136
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,940
Diamond Tiara, why are
you making that face?

137
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,600
That is not the
face of a winner.

138
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,200
Because I didn't win.

139
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,160
What? You mean I hefted
all these party supplies

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,540
to celebrate nothing?

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,880
Sorry, Mother.

142
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,380
It's bad enough you lost to that
transplant from Trottingham.

143
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,400
But imagine if you'd lost to
one of those Blank Flanks!

144
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,500
As a rich pony, you must always
think of your social standing!

145
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,740
That starts here in Ponyville
and reaches all over Equestria.

146

165
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,040
Is it weird that I
feel bad for her?

166
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,740
If it is, then
I'm weird too.

167
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,060
She wants to change, but
she doesn't know how.

168
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,980
Seems like she could
use a friend or two

169
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,100
to help her figure it out.

170
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,380
Hey, Diamond Tiara! Wait up!

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,380
What do you three want? To
gloat? Rub in my defeat?

172
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,700
Actually, we wanted to
invite you to our clubhouse

173
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,440
to hang out.

174
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,460
Really?

175
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,250
Yeah. For real.

176
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,400
Well, thanks to you all,

177
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,280
I don't have any important Class
President business to attend to

178
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,320
or anything. So,
I might as well.

179
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,360
That sounds like a yes.

180
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,180
So, do you three just sit around
here plotting out different ways

181
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,060
to try and get your Cutie Marks?

182
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,060
Actually, yeah.

183
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,980
You three are...really lucky.

184
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
We are?

185
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,780
Yeah. You get to explore
all these options,

186
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,360
learning who you really are

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,440
before you're stuck with
something you don't understand.

188
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,740
But you've done that, right?

189
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,340
Yeah! Cause I have
my Cutie Mark!

190
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,780
And I'm not struggling
at all to figure out

191
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,700
who I'm supposed to be and
what I'm supposed to be doing

192
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,640
with this mark that's
already on my flank.

193
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,460
Uh, are you sure about that?

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,320
That's a weird question.

195
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,660
Not really since we kind of
overheard you yesterday.

196
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,980
Were you trying to get
your Cutie Mark in spying?

197
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,020
Is that on your little chart?

198
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,440
No! We were just worried about
you when you lost the election

199
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,920
and then you lost your friend
and then your mom yelled at you.

200
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,260
We know you wanna change
and we think we can...

201
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,480
HEEEEELP!

202
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,030
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

203
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,900
I was at the School Board
Meeting and they didn't approve

204
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,420
my request for the new
playground equipment.

205
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
Why not?

206
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,700
There's no money in the budget!

207
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,660
So I checked my Peggy Bank
to see if I had enough bits,

208
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,110
but my little Peggy wasn't
nearly full enough.

209
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,520
Don't worry, Pip!

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,780
We'll meet you back at school!

211
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,400
And help you find a solution!

212
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,540
Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders!

213
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,600
Oh, I already
have a solution.

214
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,320
Our new Student
Pony President

215
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,040
is going to be kicked out of
office and I'll be reinstated!

216
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,420
Where is she going?

217
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,240
Where do you think!
C'mon, after her!

218
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,820

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,600
Diamond Tiara!

245
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,380
Think hard about the choice
your makin' right now!

246
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,240
You can be a
better pony!

247
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,160
Diamond Tiara!

248
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,600
I just happen to be here
for the School Board Meeting

249
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,580
and this is what I see when
we adjourn? My daughter

250
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,640
associating with confused,
insignificant, low-lifes?

251
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,960
Socializing with their
kind is not how you move up

252
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,600
in Equestria! Come,
Diamond Tiara!

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,240
No, Mother!

254
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,040
Excuse me?

255
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,260
You've spent your life
acting like a high horse

256
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,920
and raised me to follow
in your hoofprints.

257
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,740
At first, I thought
this was fine,

258
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,020
but then I finally realized I
wanted something you don't have,

259
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,160
FRIENDS!

260
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,060
That's enough,
Diamond Tiara!

261
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,400
Step away from
those BLANK FLANKS!

262
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,560
These are the Cutie
Mark Crusaders

263
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,360
and they are my friends!

264
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,460
You need to stop calling them
such mean and hurtful names.

265
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,960
They are working harder
to get their Cutie Marks

266
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,980
than anypony I've ever seen.

267
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,840
And they will get them
exactly when they discover

268
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,490
their true talent, which I
guarantee will be amazing!

269
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,980
Now, will you please
deliver this to Father?

270
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,300
Yes, of course, dear.

271
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,320
I have to thank
you, Crusaders.

272
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,600
Obviously, I've known
since I got my Cutie Mark

273
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,320
that my talent is getting other
ponies to do what I want.

274
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,380
I just asked my father if
he could donate the money

275
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,380
for the new
playground equipment.

276
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,680
I know you were worried
for a second there, weren't you?

277
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,040
Huh, well, I think it's all
going to work out just fine,

278
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,550

I've been thinkin', Crusaders.

298
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,000
We spend an awful lot of
time fussin' and frettin',

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,840
tryin' to discover
our true talent.

300
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,000
But when we take
a little time off,

301
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,460
we end up helpin' other ponies
figure out their true talent.

302
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,300
Yeah, and I think that's
way more important

303
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,640
than worrying about our
Cutie Marks, don't you?

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,320
Absolutely! I don't care
if I ever get my Cutie Mark

305
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,380
as long as I get to hang
out with my best friends.

306
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,720
So, whaddaya say, Crusaders?

307
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,180
Wanna just focus on helping
others find their Cutie Marks?

308
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,460
YEAH!

309
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,360
