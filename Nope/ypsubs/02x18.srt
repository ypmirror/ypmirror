Let's do this.

00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:36,366
Happy! Sad.
Happy! Sad.

00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,913
Open, shut.
Open, shut.

4
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:10,160
Nailed it!

00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:57,677
Morning, Daisy Jo!

9
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:59,668
You here to pick up some cookies
to go with your milk?

10
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:01,753
Oh ya, Pinkie, don'tcha know?

11
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:05,111
Well, Mrs. Cake just baked a fresh batch
of your favorite oatmeal.

12
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:08,007
Sounds delightful!

13
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,807
Rose, your calla lilies look even better
than last year!

14
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:15,318
I bet you'll take first prize
at the flower show again.

15
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,387
Thanks, Pinkie.
Would you like one?

16
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,806
Absolutely!

17
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,035
Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr. Waddle.

18
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:29,207
And you're wearing my favorite tie!

19
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:32,819
Aw shucks Miss Pinkie,
you flatterer you.

20
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:36,435
Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee.

21
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,248
Thank you, Pinkie.

22
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:40,786
Happy day-after-your-birthday, Zecora!

23
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:43,396
What a lovely hi, Miss Pinkie Pie!

24
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,108
And Miss Matilda, happy birthday to you...

25
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:49,508
...in one hundred and thirty two days!

26
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:54,723
Pinkie Pie, how do you remember
everything about everypony?

27
00:02:54,888 --> 00:03:00,138
'Cause everypony's my friend
and I love to see my friends smile!

28
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,866
<i>My name is Pinkie Pie
(Hello!)</i>

29
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:12,097
<i>And I am here to say
(How ya doin?)</i>

30
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:14,507
<i>I'm gonna make you smile</i>

31
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:18,126
<i>And I will brighten up your day!</i>

32
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:21,254
<i>It doesn't matter now
(What's up?)</i>

33
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:24,220
<i>If you are sad or blue
(Howdy!)</i>

34
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,756
<i>'Cuz cheering up my friends</i>

35
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:30,463
<i>Is just what Pinkie's here to do!</i>

36
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:36,434
<i>'Cuz I love to make you smile, smile, smile!
(Yes I do!)</i>

37
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:42,846
<i>It fills my heart with sunshine all the while!
(Yes it does!)</i>

38
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:47,398
<i>'Cuz all I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

39
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:50,209
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

40
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:55,149
<i>I like to see you grin!
(Awesome!)</i>

41
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,023
<i>I love to see you beam!
(Rock on!)</i>

42
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:01,291
<i>The corners of your mouth turned up</i>

43
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:04,364
<i>Is always Pinkie's dream!
(Hoof bump!)</i>

44
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:07,093
<i>But if you're kind of worried</i>

45
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:10,319
<i>And your face is made of frown</i>

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,575
<i>I'll work your heart and do my best</i>

47
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:17,934
<i>To turn that sad frown upside down!</i>

48
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:23,946
<i>'Cuz I love to make you grin, grin, grin!
(Yes I do!)</i>

49
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:29,414
<i>Busted out from ear to ear, let it begin!</i>

50
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:35,150
<i>Just give me a joyful
grin, grin, grin!</i>

51
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:37,403
<i>And you fill me with good cheer!</i>

52
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:41,878
<i>It's true, some days are dark and lonely</i>

53
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,380
<i>And maybe you feel sad</i>

54
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:48,896
<i>But Pinkie will be there to show you
that it isn't that bad!</i>

55
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:51,409
<i>There is one thing that makes me happy</i>

56
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,058
<i>And makes my whole life worthwhile</i>

57
00:04:55,059 --> 00:05:00,926
<i>And that's when I talk to my friends
and get them to smile!</i>

58
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:04,260
<i>I really am so happy!</i>

59
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,994
<i>Your smile fills me with glee!</i>

60
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:10,450
<i>I give a smile, I get a smile</i>

61
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,991
<i>And that's so special to me!</i>

62
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:19,239
<i>'Cuz I love to see you beam, beam, beam!
(Yes I do!)</i>

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,664
<i>Tell me what more can I say to make you see
(That I do!)</i>

64
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:30,478
<i>It makes me happy when you
beam, beam, beam!</i>

65
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,794
<i>Yes, it always makes my day!</i>

66
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:36,698
<i>Come on everypony, smile, smile smile!</i>

67
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:40,000
<i>Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!</i>

68
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,905
<i>All I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

69
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:46,002
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

70
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:48,962
<i>Come on everypony, smile, smile, smile!</i>

71
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:52,088
<i>Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!</i>

72
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,963
<i>All I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

73
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:58,040
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

74
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,116
<i>That's the perfect gift for me!
(Come on everypony, smile, smile, smile!)</i>

75
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:04,279
<i>It's a smile as wide as a mile!
(Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!)</i>

76
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,058
<i>To make me happy as can be!
(All I really need's a smile, smile, smile!)</i>

77
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,594
<i>To make me happy as can be!
(From these happy friends of...)</i>

78
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:16,411
<i>Smile! Smile! Smile! Smile! Smiiiiiile!</i>

79
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:19,400
<i>Come on and smile!
(Smile!)</i>

80
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:21,450
<i>Come on and smile!</i>

81
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,748
I've never seen you before.

82
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:29,019
Kid, you're smarter than you look.

83
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,768
Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie.
What's your name?

84
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:38,161
"Property of C.D.D."

85
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:40,348
I'm guessing that last "D"
is for Donkey.

86
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:41,858
Quick as a whip, kid.

87
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:43,818
Now, how about that C...

88
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:50,708
Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine?
Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico?

89
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:55,787
Claudio? Cleetus? Clifford? Coraline?
Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopher?

90
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:58,018
Cranky! It's Cranky, alright?!

91
00:06:58,496 --> 00:06:59,596
And your middle name?

92
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:01,246
Doodle.

93
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:02,847
- I'm sorry?
- Doodle.

94
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:04,288
One more time!

95
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:07,492
Doodle.

96
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,866
So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?

97
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:14,168
<i>You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey guy</i>

98
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,103
<i>A Cranky Doodle Donkey</i>

99
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:17,903
<i>I've never met you,
 but you're my new friend</i>

100
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,065
<i>And I'm your best friend Pinkie Pie!</i>

101
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:23,836
C'mon now, Doodle. Give a smile!

102
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,798
Nopony calls me Doodle!

103
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,975
What just happened?

104
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:39,280
<i>Meet somepony new, check.</i>

105
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:40,975
<i>Introduce myself, check.</i>

106
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:43,449
<i>Sing random song outta nowhere, check.</i>

107
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,615
<i>Become instant best friends... uncheck.</i>

108
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:51,288
I don't get it, how can somepony
not become instant best friends with me?

109
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,144
Was it something I said?
Was it something I sang?

110
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:59,292
This is no time for the blame game,
Pinkie!

111
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:03,089
There's somepony new in town,
and you need to win him over!

112
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,185
"Try everything you can to make
Cranky smile and be your friend".

113
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,068
Check!

114
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,614
Alright, Pinkie.

115
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:21,102
If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship,
you're gonna have to bring your A game!

116
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,935
Let's do this.

117
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,460
Howdy doody, Cranky Doodle!

118
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,574
So... are you moving to Ponyville,
Cranky?

119
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,531
What gave you the hint there, kid?

120
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:40,158
The cart full of stuff, maybe?

121
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,929
Well, I'd be happy to show you around.

122
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,120
It's the least a new friend can do.

123
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,659
Listen, kid, I traveled around Equestria
my entire life.

124
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,140
I've made many friends.
I don't need any more.

125
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,256
Gosh! I could never have
too many friends!

126
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:59,035
Well, why don't you go
and make some more?

127
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:03,632
But I don't need to go,
when I can stay and make friends...

128
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,933
...with you.

129
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:08,510
Look, kid...

130
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:13,530
Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie.
All of my friends do.

131
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:15,992
Look, kid,

132
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:20,255
I came to Ponyville for some peace
and quiet and privacy,

133
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:22,169
to be alone with my memories.

134
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,047
All I want is to get to my new home
and unpack my stuff.

135
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,141
What does this bauble do?

136
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,059
Don't touch that!

137
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:33,338
What's this?

138
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:36,755
Please, don't!

139
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,298
Look at these!

140
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:45,836
Pinkie! Keep your hooves off my wagon!

141
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:47,966
Okay, Cranky.

142
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:56,726
I promised not to touch your wagon
so I brought one of my own!

143
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,117
I use it to welcome folks!

144
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,418
Who'da guessed...

145
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,017
Maybe we can be wagon buddies?

146
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,611
Well, you've gotta at least let me
give you the special welcome

147
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:09,250
that comes with it...

148
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:15,992
Let's get this over with.

149
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:17,393
That's the spirit!

150
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:24,397
<i>Welcome welcome welcome</i>

151
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:26,222
<i>A fine welcome to you</i>

152
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:29,939
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
I say how do you do?</i>

153
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,443
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
I say hip hip hurray</i>

154
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:39,238
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
to Ponyville today!</i>

155
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,830
Wait for it!

156
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:50,733
Oh, silly me!

157
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:54,294
I must've put the confetti in the oven
and the cake in the confetti cannons!

158
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,395
Again!

159
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:01,428
Still delicious!
Try some, Cranky.

160
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:03,211
It's sure to make you smile.

161
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:06,246
Where is it, where is it?

162
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,334
Where is what?

163
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:10,870
Spider! Big hairy spider!

164
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:16,943
Stop, stop, stop!

165
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:21,371
Was that your wig?

166
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:23,556
I can fix this, I can fix this!

167
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:28,051
Hey, everypony!
Does anypony have a toupee?

168
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,570
This donkey is really, really, bald!

169
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:43,250
What's so funny?
This is serious business, everypony!

170
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:46,857
Cranky needs a new wig
to cover his hairless head!

171
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:48,900
I have had enough!

172
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,663
You're losing him, Pinkie.

173
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:59,195
Wait, Cranky, please!
Let me make it up to you...

174
00:11:59,196 --> 00:11:59,996
No!

175
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,776
Please! Please please please...

176
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,485
Ladies, this is a spa emergency.

177
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:06,952
Cranky needs help, STAT.

178
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:23,522
Hi, Cranky, I have a gift for you!

179
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,606
The spa treatment was gift enough.

180
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:27,891
It's not going to
explode or anything, promise.

181
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:28,892
Just open it!

182
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:33,176
It's a new toupee!

183
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:34,838
I had my friend Rarity make it.

184
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,379
She calls it the "dreamboat special".

185
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:44,800
This is wonderful.
Thanks, kid.

186
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,447
He's starting to warm up,
but still no smile.

187
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:59,139
Hey! Whatcha doing there,
ol' buddy ol' pal?

188
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,340
What's it look like?

189
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:02,118
Looks like a yard sale.

190
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,389
I'll give you two bits for this!

191
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,378
I'm not selling, kid.
I'm unpacking.

192
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:11,874
Why didn't you say so?

193
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,862
I thought I had.

194
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:18,017
This is so pretty!
Where'd you get it?

195
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:21,020
Manehattan, now put it down, gently.

196
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:23,278
Really? What were you doin' there?

197
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,230
Trying to find a friend...

198
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,754
I'm always trying to find friends,
and today I found you.

199
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,055
See how good I am at it?

200
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,187
This was a special friend.

201
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:36,077
- Like me?
- No, you're extra special, kid.

202
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:38,834
Yes, I'm in!

203
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:44,059
Where in Equestria did you get this,
Cranky?

204
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,160
Fillydelphia.

205
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,253
It's awfully pretty.

206
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:49,734
Yes, she was.

207
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,620
I mean, it was. I mean, it is.

208
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:54,732
Yes, it's pretty, now put it down!

209
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,106
I wonder where Cranky got this.

210
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,601
Will you look at that?

211
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:07,434
Hey, Cranky!
Can I ask you about...

212
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:10,889
Oh no!

213
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,230
What did you sa-yayayayay!

214
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:14,976
What have you done?!

215
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:22,485
There!
All better?

216
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,938
No, not all better, all soggy!

217
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:28,424
I'm sorry, Cranky!

218
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:32,495
Oh, you're sorry, well, then,
everything is fine!

219
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:36,659
- It is?
- No! It isn't!

220
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,987
Listen to me, kid,
I will never be your friend!

221
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,616
Never, or never-ever?

222
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:45,276
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!

223
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:53,970
That's four "ever"s.
That's like... forever!

224
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,789
I just can't believe it.

225
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,792
Cranky said he would never forever
be my friend.

226
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,263
It was horrible.

227
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:08,469
I know this is hard for you, Pinkie.
Seeing that you're friends with everypony.

228
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,815
But you just have to accept that Cranky
is gonna be an exception.

229
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:14,226
He just... doesn't want to be bothered.

230
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:18,251
Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered
by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.

231
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,252
Rainbow!

232
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:23,270
No, no, it's okay, Twilight.
I get what you're saying.

233
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:24,927
What you're both saying.

234
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:28,232
And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone.

235
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:31,715
Right after he accepts my apology!

236
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:41,122
Cranky!

237
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:44,522
No! No!
Leave me alone!

238
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:46,195
Wait!

239
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,982
I understand that you don't want me
as a friend!

240
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:50,593
No, I don't!

241
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:53,011
So I just wanted to say "I'm sorry"!

242
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:54,665
Fine! You said it!

243
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,284
But do you accept my apology?

244
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,085
No!

245
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:01,066
Oh Cranky! Please accept my apology!
Please!

246
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:01,867
No!

247
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:04,304
But I'm really, really, really...

248
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,089
Really, really...

249
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,912
Really, really, really...

250
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,651
Really, really, really...

251
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,637
Really, really, really...

252
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,448
Really, really, really,really...

253
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:31,636
Really. Really. Really. Really.
Really. Really. Really. Really...

254
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,184
Sorry!

255
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,454
Cranky, please, please accept my apology!

256
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:52,820
I'd do anything to make it up to you!

257
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,734
But there's nothing you can do!

258
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,153
You ruined my book!

259
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:59,306
You destroyed all I have
to remember her by!

260
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:01,424
Her?
Her who?

261
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:03,170
The special friend?

262
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:04,968
Go away, Pinkie!

263
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:17,366
Cranky? It's me again.

264
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:21,206
I understand that you don't wanna
be my friend or accept my apology...

265
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,298
Before I leave you alone forever,

266
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:27,126
I have something to at least try
to make up for ruining your book.

267
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:29,377
No, I don't want it, kid!

268
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:33,210
Anything you would give me is sure
to lead to some sort of disaster!

269
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:36,759
Goodness, you really are cranky.

270
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:50,522
It can't be... is it really you?

271
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:53,278
It can, and it is.

272
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,318
Matilda! But how?

273
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:58,003
Pinkie.

274
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:01,498
But... I never told you about her!

275
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:02,759
You didn't have to.

276
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,831
I put two and two and two together
and it added up to Matilda.

277
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:07,632
What?

278
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,816
Well when you were talking about
your souvenirs,

279
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:12,175
you said something about trying to find
a special friend!

280
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:16,036
And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday.

281
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:18,951
My birthday isn't for
another seventy five days!

282
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:23,939
And then, in your scrapbook,
there was a flower, an old ticket,

283
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,099
and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala!

284
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,736
And I knew I recognized all these things.

285
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:31,382
But how could you have
ever seen them before?

286
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:34,977
Because I also have them in my scrapbook.

287
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:38,148
And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!

288
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,685
Oh, Matilda.

289
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:46,506
The night we met at the gala
was the most magical night of my life.

290
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:57,703
<i>I couldn't wait to see you again.</i>

291
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:02,000
<i>But when I came to your room
the next day, you were gone.</i>

292
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,590
<i>Didn't you get my note?</i>

293
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,085
<i>No, I never got it.</i>

294
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:10,779
<i>Ever since that day,
I've gone from town...</i>

295
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,894
<i>to town... to town...</i>

296
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:16,475
<i>Searching all over Equestria for you.</i>

297
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:18,920
Until finally I gave up.

298
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:22,154
I came to Ponyville
to retire from my search.

299
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:25,517
I was living in Ponyville
the whole time.

300
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:29,854
I always hoped that some day
you would come and find me.

301
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:30,855
Doodle.

302
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:34,870
Matilda?
Nopony calls him Doodle...

303
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:37,859
Nopony... but Matilda.

304
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:47,385
Doodle, I'm so happy to see you.

305
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,241
So does this mean
that you accept my apology?

306
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:07,132
Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology.

307
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,719
And, I am honored to call you my friend.

308
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:21,071
This is just fantastic!

309
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:24,842
Now we can hang out together,
and chat, and sing songs, and...

310
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:25,843
party!

311
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:27,951
I can throw you guys a big party!

312
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:30,676
It'll be called "Welcome to Ponyville,
I found my lost love...

313
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:32,841
I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie" Party!

314
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:38,101
Or maybe something less over-the-top
and not so super-hyper.

315
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:41,694
Pinkie, we're eternally
grateful to you, but...

316
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:46,496
Matilda and I just want to spend some
time together in peace and quiet.

317
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,934
But we're still friends?

318
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:53,266
Pinkie, you went way, way, way
out of your way to make me happy.

319
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:55,229
Of course we're friends.

320
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:57,187
Great!

321
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,933
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

322
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:02,633
<i>there are many different kinds of friends,</i>

323
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,858
<i>and many ways to express friendship.</i>

324
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,904
Some friends like to run and laugh
and play together.

325
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:11,423
<i>But others just like to be left alone,
and that's fine too.</i>

326
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:16,256
<i>But the best thing about friendship
is being able to make your friends smile.</i>

327
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:20,321
<i>He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart</i>

328
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,476
<i>She's his Cranky Doodle joy</i>

329
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:26,442
<i>I helped a Cranky Doodle boy, yeah</i>

330
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:28,913
<i>I helped a Cranky Doodle boy</i>

331
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,114
Pinkie!

332
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:32,323
Oops, privacy, sorry.
