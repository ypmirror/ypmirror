Oh, good morning little friends,
your singing is oh so pretty.

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,520
Yes, it is a very
beautiful day today,

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,020
certainly something
worth singing about.

You're too kind.

<i>WOW!</i>

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,280
Oh. You um, you didn't
hear me, um ...

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,870
Singing in the most
beautiful voice ever?

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,650
Uh, yeah we did!

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Subtitles by YayPonies

20
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,490
Wow! I've never heard you
sing a solo like that before.

21
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,290
It was like a little
slice of heaven.

22
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,530
With ice cream on top!

23
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,810
Fluttershy, I cannot believe
your spectacular voice

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,120
isn't part of the
Pony Tones Quartet!

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,520
Um...well...I...

26
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,300
Especially since you're
having us perform

27
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,910
for your Ponyville Pet Center
Fundraiser tomorrow night!

28
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,830
Well, you see, I...

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,110
This simply must be rectified!

30
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,720
You must share that
stunning voice at the event.

31
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,830
Yeah! It will be so amazing!

32
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,690
You'd be there on stage,
basking in the hooflights,

33
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,970
the center of attention,
a shining star...

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,870
<i>With everypony staring</i>
<i>at you, judging you,</i>

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,420
jealously noting how they
could be WAY better than you.

36
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,530
Why wasn't it them?
Why wasn't it them?

37
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,930
<i>And then, when you choke,</i>
<i>they'll turn on you</i>

38
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,560
becoming a seething angry mob

39
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,280
and you'll be horribly
humiliated,

40
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,480
never able to show your
face in Ponyville again!

41
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,290
Pinkie Pie! Don't
be ridiculous!

42
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,600
But I'm so good at it!

43
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,740
Come, Fluttershy.

44
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,920
You will join the group making
the Pony Tones Quartet

45
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,010
the Pony Tones Quintet!

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,260
No!

47
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,920
Pardon me?

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,070
I love the Pony Tones.

49
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,830
I'm one of their biggest fans.

50
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,320
But I do not want to
perform with them.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,180
Why not, Fluttershy?

52
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,620
Well you see, I...I
have...um...I-I have...

53
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,540
Spit it out!

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,020
I have...stage fright!

55
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,590
Is it contagious?

56
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,190
Stage fright isn't
a disease, Pinkie.

57
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,700
It just means that Fluttershy
is scared to perform

58
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,780
in front of everypony.

59
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm very thankful
the Pony Tones

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,860
are singing at the Pet
Center Fundraiser.

61
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,540
<i>And I'm really looking</i>
<i>forward to the performance.</i>

62
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,460
But I'll be watching
safely from the audience.

63
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,180
Well, I think it's a terrible
waste of an exquisite talent,

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,460
but I understand that
you're not comfortable.

65
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:56,890
Thank you.

66
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,780
Ooh! Angel's right!

67
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,890
We better get going!

68
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,710
There's a lot of work to
do before tomorrow's event!

69
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,210
Ahem!

70
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,610
All right, Pony Tones, let's
run through that again!

Rarity, you were awesome!

78
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,130
Thank you, Spike, but
this is an ensemble.

79
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,140
Enh, the rest of you
were pretty good, too.

80
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,140
Oh, I thought you were all
amazing, Pony Tones.

81
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,700
Thanks, Fluttershy!

82
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,700
Now, Pony Tones, I want you
all to rest your voices

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,740
for the remainder of the day.

84
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,220
We'll do a final run-through
tomorrow before the big event.

85
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,970
All right?

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,790
Eeyup.

87
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,080
Sounds great!

88
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,690
Oh, Rarity, the Pony Tones
are really going to make

89
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,640
the Ponyville Pet Center
Fundraiser so special!

90
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,370
Thank you so much for
helping me help the animals!

91
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,560
Oh yes. It is wonderful
when a plan comes together

92
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,720
without any sort of
drama, isn't it?

93
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,000
Morning, Fluttershy.

94
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,230
Good morning,
Pony Tones!

95
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,710
Actually, we're the Pony
Tones minus one tone.

96
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,290
Big Mac is
inconveniently late.

97
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,880
Well, there you are!

98
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,960
Have I not told you
about punctuality?

99
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,350
Ah! I don't want
to hear it!

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,320
Big Mac! Can you please
start the song?

101
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,190
Nnope.

102
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,110
Big Mac!

103
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,560
Did you lose your voice?

104
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,430
Eeyup.

105
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,130
Whatever did you
do to cause this?

106
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,790
Well...

107
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,910
Howdy, everypony!

108
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,270
And welcome to the 12th Annual
Ponyville Turkey Call!

109
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,450
Who will take the
title this year?

110
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,000
Will it be somepony new?

111
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,460
Or will the Turkey Call
champion of six years

112
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,420
<i>defend his title to make</i>
<i>it lucky number seven?</i>

113
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,460
We'll find out if
ya stop yer gabbin'

114
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,780
and git on with
the gobblin'!

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,250
All right, everypony!

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,950
Let's talk turkey!

117
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Big Mac, yer up!

118
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,720
A Turkey Call?

119
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,320
You lost your voice
doing a...Turkey Call?

120
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,700
Lost his voice and the title!

121
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,440
Now we can't
perform tonight.

122
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,470
Wait! What? No!

123
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,120
You have to perform!

124
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,750
Otherwise the fundraiser
will be a disaster.

125
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,590
Well, we cannot perform
tonight with only three voices.

126
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,830
Why not?

127
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,230
It would take rearranging
all the music

128
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,420
and we just don't have time.

129
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,820
<i>I'm sorry, Fluttershy,</i>
<i>but I have no remedy</i>

130
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,840
<i>for this situation.</i>

131
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
Of course!

132
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,750
A remedy!

133
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,810
Follow me!

134
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,990
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,940
Hmmm.

136
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,080
Aaahh.

137
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,580
I can cure this
pony that is hoarse,

138
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,450
but it will take
a longer course.

139
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,720
Come again?

140
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,590
Hmmm.

141
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,420
I can mix a brew that
will work just right,

142
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,590
but it cannot heal
him by tonight.

143
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,640
Oh no!

144
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,480
Where are we ever going
to find a deep voice

145
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,050
to replace Big Mac's?

146
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,600
Pardon me, Zecora,
but this is no laughing matter.

147
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,830
We need a bass voice for
the harmonies to work!

148
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,040
Without it, the
performance will be ruined!

149
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,570
Please forgive my
strange elation,

150
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,870
but I was not laughing
at your situation.

151
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,780
Then what?

152
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,430
Remember when you pony folk
stumbled into Poison Joke?

153
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,930
<i>Miss Fluttershy had</i>
<i>an unusual change,</i>

154
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,960
<i>deepening her vocal range.</i>

155
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,290
I don't want to
talk about it.

156
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,140
Yes, yes!

157
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,260
Your voice became really
low, making it sound like...

158
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,170
Flutterguy!

159
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,860
With these leaves,
I can mix a brew

160
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,410
creating the same
effect on you.

161
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,740
Zecora, that's fantastic!

162
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,460
Yes! I'll do it!

163
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,070
I'd do anything for the animals!

164
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,830
Why, you'd even
appear on stage!

165
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,630
Oh, except that.

166
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,710
I just can't bring
myself to sing on stage

167
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,070
in front of everypony.

168
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,100
What if you sang NOT
in front of everypony?

169
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,100
Huh?

170
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,500
What if Big Mac was on
stage moving his lips

171
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,900
while you're behind the
curtain singing his part?

172
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,800
It would be just like
singing in your house.

173
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,560
<i>Nopony would know it was you.</i>

174
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,190
Even still. I just don't think
I could sing in front of--

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,430
You must! For the animals!

176
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,540
Oh, OK, then...mix it up.

177
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,530
Now do it just
like we practiced.

178
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,940
Good evening,

Prob'ly hidin'.

185
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,240
You know how much that
pony hates the spotlight.

Pony Tones!

207
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,930
That was truly amazing!

208
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,540
And you sounded better
than ever, big brother!

209
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,200
Fluttershy, you were on the
wrong side of the curtain!

210
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,910
You totally missed the show!

211
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,710
Just like a true professional,
Fluttershy was back stage

212
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,670
making sure everything
ran smoothly.

213
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,540
And it was perfect!

214
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,190
That was fantastic, Pony Tones.

215
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,120
My new puppy and I thought it
was super duper crazy good!

216
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,430
Why, thank you!

217
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,780
And we were wondering if you
would consider performing

218
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,630
at my daughter
Zippoorwhill's Cuteciñera.

219
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,160
Will you? Will you?

220
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,320
We'd love to!

221
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,610

224

Oh, gracious, I'm
terribly sorry.

225
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,910
That's just much
too last-minute.

226
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,270
Oh no!

227
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,840

Amazing Pony Tones!

239
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,100
And it would be even more
amazing if you could perform

240
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,050
at my ribbon-cutting
ceremony tomorrow!

241
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,030
Oh, Mayor, we would
love to but...

242
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,180
Will you excuse us
for a second, Mayor?

243
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,390
Certainly.

244
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,510
Don't
worry, Fluttershy.

245
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,950
You don't have to
perform again.

246
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,960
But we wouldn't
want to disappoint the Mayor.

247
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,610
Well then Mayor,

248
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,880

Big Mac!

279
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,680
You got some 'splainin' to do!

280
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,030

Eeyup.

281
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,030

Eeyup.

283
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,370

Nope.

284
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,910
Needed a deep voice?
Eeyup.

285
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,080

Eeyup.

286
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,350

00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,410
Better now?
Eeyup.

288
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,360
And that shy filly was living
her dream in the shadows

289
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,290
because she couldn't
bring herself

290
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,250
to come into the
spotlight?

291
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Eeyup.

292
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,320

293
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,230

295
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,990
You in here?

296
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,040
Yes.

297
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,960
I'm here.

298
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,240
<i>That was totally</i>
<i>unbelievable!</i>

299
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,830
I mean, the curtain came
up, and there you were,

300
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,760
singing in front of everypony!

301
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,830
And, you know, I don't think
any pony was jealous

302
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,200
cause there certainly
wasn't an angry mob!

303
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,650
But it must have been horrible
standing there on stage!

304
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,390
All eyes glued directly on you.

305
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,640
It's like you were living your
own personal worst nightmare!

306
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,840
It was!

307
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,320
What? Too much?

308
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,070
What Pinkie meant to say was
that you were really great.

309
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,370
Wait! Didn't I say that?

310
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,620
Hardly!

311
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,460
Whoops!

312
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,510
YOU WERE GREAT!

313
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,480
You totally blew
my mind!

314
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,790
Incredible!

315
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,100
Though, no offence, you
kind of sounded like a dude.

316
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,830
A great sounding dude!

317
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,910
Well, thank you all.

318
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,650
I'm glad you enjoyed it...

319
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,660
...because I'm never going to
sing in front of anypony

320
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,850
ever again.

321
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,690
Oh no!

322
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,830
Are you kidding me?

323
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,290
Can we please
stop running!

324
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,790
I just don't understand
why, Fluttershy.

325
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,610
<i>After all, you're the one</i>
<i>that wanted the Pony Tones</i>

326
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,690
to sing for every silly
thing that was requested of us.

327
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,940
You mean, you knew I
really wanted to perform?

328
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,850
Of course I knew!

329
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,270
Oh.

330
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,010
And for all her babbling, Pinkie
Pie was right about one thing.

331
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,490
Only one?

332
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,770
When that curtain fell, and
everypony saw you singing,

333
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,420
you lived your worst nightmare.

334
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,110
Was it really that bad?

335
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,730
Yes!

336
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,880
Well, what was so bad about it?

337
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,690
The thunderous
applause?

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,840

fantastic singin'?

<i>♪ Find you've got the music. </i>

349
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,440
<i>♪ Cause when you look</i>

351

<i>♪ Got the music, got</i>
<i>the music...in you! ♪</i>

352
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,040
You did it,
Fluttershy!

353
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,090
See? That
wasn't so bad.

354
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,490
And you didn't look completely
petrified by the fact

355
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,150
that we're all staring
at you at all!

356
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,500
How do you feel?

357
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,110
Surprisingly OK!

358
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,340
<i>Fantastic!</i>

359
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,050
Because the Pony Tones
have been booked for the

360
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,170
Apple Family's Zap Apple
Jam Extraordinaire!

361
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,360
Oh no! I couldn't
do that!

362
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,690
Why not?
How come?
Seriously?

363
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,700
I'll get there someday.

364
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,350
But for now, baby
steps, everypony.

365
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,610
Baby steps.

366
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,550
<i>Sometimes being</i>
<i>afraid can stop you</i>

367
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,540
<i>from doing something</i>
<i>that you love.</i>

368
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,590
<i>But hiding behind these fears</i>
<i>means you're only hiding</i>

369
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,870
<i>from your true self.</i>

370
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,720
<i>It's much better to</i>
<i>face those fears</i>

371
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:29,470
so you can shine and be the best
<i>pony you can possibly be!</i>
