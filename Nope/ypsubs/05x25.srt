1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,940
If somepony had told me when I
was a blank-flank that one day

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,440
I'd give a speech to a class
at Celestia's School of Magic,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,770
I wouldn't have believed it.
But...

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,820
I hope that I have
been up to the task

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,000
because I can tell
that all of you are,

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,220
and that the future
of Equestrian magic

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,290
is in good hooves.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,140
Wow. That was even better
than the first eleven times!

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,940
I don't know, Spike.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,040
I'd like to be able to get
through the whole speech

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,460
without looking at the cards.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,480
Come on, Twilight, you can't be
nervous about giving a speech

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,140
to a bunch of magic students.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,680
Oh, I'm not nervous, Spike, but
I do have to set a good example,

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,560
especially for
magic students.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,440
That's why this
speech has to be...

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,320
Perfect?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,900
Exactly. Let's go
through it one more time.

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,880
Ahem.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,920
When Princess Celestia asked
me to speak to you today,

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,480
I was honored to
have the opportunity

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,140
to talk about my favorite
subject - magic.

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:30,220
Hearing impaired subtitles

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,180
Obviously the long-term effects
of the simultaneous acquisition

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,560
of cutie marks has yet
to be determined, but...

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,700
Ahem. Next slide, please.

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,660
...I can speak from
my own experience

28
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,500
that the power of cutie
mark magic is very real.

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,820
And in the instance
of my friends and I,

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,060
it can be traced
to a single event.

31
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,920
Without Rainbow Dash's race
to defend Fluttershy's honor,

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,040
this Rainboom wouldn't
have happened.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,340
Fluttershy might never have
discovered her love of animals.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,340
Applejack might
never have realized

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,940
that she belonged
on her farm.

36
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,220
And Pinkie might never have
decided to leave hers.

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,620
It might be hard
to imagine Rarity

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,540
without her sense
of fabulousness.

39
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,740
But it's even harder to fathom
what my life would be like.

40
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,780
Without this Rainboom,

41
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,980
I might not have gotten
into magic school;

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,440
Celestia wouldn't have
taken me on as her pupil

43
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,980
or sent me to Ponyville
to meet my friends.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,880
And the most powerful thing
about cutie mark magic

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,540
that I've found is the
connection I share with them.

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,000
But, um...

47
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,320
the real question
about cutie mark magic is

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,120
who it seems to affect.

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,480
Starlight Glimmer?

50
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,340
I was sure I saw her, Spike,

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,420
but when I looked
again she was gone.

52
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm just worried what
she could be up to.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
Nothing good, I bet.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
I heard she wasn't very happy
the last time you saw her.

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,780
Forcing everypony in her village
to have the same cutie mark

56
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,140
wasn't right. We
had to do something.

57
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,260
And now she's coming
back for revenge.

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,800
Or she was just really
interested in your speech.

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,620
Honestly, Spike, I'm not
really sure what I saw.

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,660
But as long as I
have my friends,

61
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,360
I know everything
will be all right.

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,140
Maybe I was just
more stressed

63
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,740
about that speech
than I thought.

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,100
Yeah, that sounds better than
Starlight Glimmer coming back

65
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,900
with an evil plot for revenge.

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,040
Well, when you say it like that,
it does sound kind of silly.

67
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,400
Or it's totally true!

68
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,760
Welcome home, Twilight!

69
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,600
What are you doing, Starlight?

70
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,160
I'd tell you, but I don't
want to ruin the surprise!

71
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,980
Won't be needing that
anymore.

72
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,120
Where'd she go?

73
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,160
I don't know, Spike. But I
think we better find out.

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,320
I guess we could
start with this.

75
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,820
Spike, no! Don't touch that!

76
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,240
Huh.

77
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,360
Cloudsdale! Starlight
doesn't even have wings.

78
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Why would she come here?

79
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,840
I don't know, Spike,

80
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,320
but it looked like she
could fly with just magic.

81
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,160
Keep your eyes open. We don't
know what she has planned.

82
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,640
Isn't that Rainbow Dash?

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,320
Did Rainbow Dash look
really young to you?

84
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,920
And I didn't see a cutie
mark. You don't think.

85
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,340
We travelled back in time

86
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,280
to when Rainbow
Dash raced the bullies

87
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,700
who made fun of Fluttershy

88
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,860
and performed her
first Sonic Rainboom?

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,580
Spike, only Starswirl
the Bearded

90
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,820
could do
something like that.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,940
And even his spell
just went back a week.

92
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,580
How could Starlight do more

93
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,440
than the greatest
wizard in Equestria?

94
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,560
With this.

95
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,140
Starswirl's spell. Oh, no.

96
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,800
Come on let's go!

97
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Go where?

98
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,420
To watch the race! I don't
want to miss the Rainboom.

99
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,960
Whoa!

100
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,700
Whoa!

101
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,500
Later Rainbow Crash!

102
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
Hey!

103
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Aw, sorry about this.

104
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,620
Hey, what gives?

105
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,680
What did you do?

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
You are about to find out.

107
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
I don't know what
Starlight's up to yet,

108
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,180
but we'd better figure it
out before it's too late.

109
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,420
Um, Twilight, I
think it already is.

110
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,440
Uh Twilight,
where's your castle?

111
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,720
The map pulled us back,

112
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,260
but whatever Starlight did in
the past changed things here.

113
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,880
But why? And how did we get
here? And where's here?

114
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,560
More like when.

115
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,620
What do you mean?

116
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,780
Starlight altered Starswirl's
spell, then somehow used it

117
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,680
on the map to travel into the
past and change something.

118
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,540
Once she did, the map pulled
us back to the present.

119
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,420
So we're back where...

120
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,140
I mean, when we started?

121
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,580
Not exactly.

122
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,240
Everything's different.

123
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
Look, the map doesn't
even make sense anymore.

124
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,320
The Crystal Empire takes
up half of Equestria.

125
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,660
Plus there's the whole
missing castle thing.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,700
Right.

127
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,240
This is too big to
handle on our own.

128
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,380
You think?

129
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,840
We need to find our
friends and get help.

130
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,580
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this, Twilight.

131
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,140
I know, Spike.

132
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,260
But this is Ponyville.
How bad can things be?

133
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,060
Is that Sugar Cube Corner?

134
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,220
I don't understand.

135
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,160
Rarity?

136
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,340
Rarity?

137
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,900
I don't think she's
here, Spike.

138
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm not sure anything
we know is the same,

139
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,380
but I know one place
that could never change.

140
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,060
Applejack?

141
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,840
What can I do for ya?

142
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,480
It's so good to see you!

143
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,380
We couldn't find
Pinkie or Rarity

144
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,120
or Fluttershy
or Rainbow Dash,

145
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,320
but I just knew
you'd still be here.

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,500
Of course I am.
This is my home.

147
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,220
But who in tarnation is
Pinkie Bow and Flutter Dash?

148
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,340
Or you for that matter?

149
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,020
You don't know who I am?

150
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,520
Nope. Honestly, the only
name I recognized is Rarity,

151
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,660
but she left for
Manehattan years ago.

152
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,120
Probably to become a world-
famous fashion designer, I bet.

153
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,600
Not
that I know of.

154
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,500
Last I heard, she went
to help with the cause

155
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,660
like everypony else.

156
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,960
The cause?

157
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
The war against King Sombra
and the Crystal Empire?

158
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,940
What?

159
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,300
Where have you
two been?

160
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,620
Actually, it's when.

161
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,900
I know this is hard to believe,

162
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,060
but you and I and those other
ponies I mentioned are friends.

163
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,820
Did you bump your head on a
crate of cider or somethin'?

164
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,980
I'm telling you the truth and if
you come with me, I'll prove it.

165
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,120
Well, I'll admit, I've lived in
these here parts my whole life

166
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,480
and I've never seen this before.

167
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,100
There's also supposed to be
a castle that goes with it.

168
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,160
But I still don't see
what this has to do

169
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,500
with you and I
being friends.

170
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,320
Another pony named Starlight
Glimmer used this map

171
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,760
to travel through time and
change things in the past.

172
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,800
For some reason, the
map's here,

173
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,340
but everything
else is different.

174
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Different how?

175
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,040
Well, for one thing,
where we came from,

176
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,680
there's no war with King Sombra.

177
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,960
Maybe you could tell
us how the war started.

178
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,320
Then we can figure out
when everything changed.

179
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,480
That's easy enough.

180
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,760
When the Crystal
Empire returned,

181
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,860
it brought King
Sombra back with it.

182
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,500
And it didn't take long
for him to force

183
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,780
every one of his subjects to
fight for him against Equestria.

184
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,420
And even with Princess
Celestia leading the charge.

185
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,640
It still takes every
last pony in Equestria...

186
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,600
...doing their part...

187
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,040
...working day and night
to keep up the fight.

188
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,580
I just can't believe it.
We stopped King Sombra.

189
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,780
You and me and all
of our friends.

190
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,760
But we aren't friends.
At least not here.

191
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,420
Right.

192
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,580
Look, I hope all this helped,

193
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,460
but I really need to get
back to canning those apples.

194
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,580
Thank you. We're going
to set things right.

195
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,900
I hope you do.

196
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,520
So. How are we going
to set things right?

197
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,060
I DON'T KNOW!

198
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,180
The only thing we know for sure

199
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,320
is that Starlight
stopped the Rainboom.

200
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,000
And that the
map's still here.

201
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,940
Spike! That's it!

202
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,120
The map is connected to
the Tree of Harmony.

203
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,180
It must sense that
something isn't right.

204
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,820
That's why it's still here.

205
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,360
I'll just use Starlight's
version of the spell

206
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,660
and go back a little earlier

207
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,620
and stop her before she
even knows we're there!

208
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,640
Aaaah!

209
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,680
All we have to do now is
find Starlight and st-

210
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,800
<i>Well, finding her</i>
<i>will be easy.</i>

211
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,960
But stopping her's going to
be harder than you think!

212
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,400
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I created that spell

213
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,520
to send myself back in time.

214
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,660
So even when you cast it, I
still get sent back here.

215
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,760
It wasn't difficult to
change Starswirl's spell;

216
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,520
he'd already done the hard part.

217
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,960
But figuring out I could use the
map to go to any time or place

218
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,860
and pull you along with me?

219
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,300
Ha ha! I even impressed
myself with that.

220
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,980
I knew you'd try to stop
me. You're so predictable.

221
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Why else would I leave
the scroll behind?

222
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,040
Touching it triggered
the map to whisk you here

223
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
and watch me erase
the one thing

224
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,600
that linked
you with your friends.

225
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,480
My village was a
sanctuary of equality

226
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,480
where no pony's cutie mark
allowed them to feel superior.

227
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,340
It was a special place, and you
and your friends took it away.

228
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,920
Now it's my turn to take
something special from you.

229
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,040
Without the Rainboom, you and
your friends will never form

230
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,260
your special cutie mark bond.

231
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,060
Cutie marks for cutie marks.
Sounds like a fair trade to me.

232
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,280
Twilight!

233
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,140
Whoops!

234
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,760
Thanks.

235
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,120
No problem, Spike.

236
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,820
At least now we know
exactly what we have to do.

237
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,180
OK. Keep your eyes peeled.

238
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,900
Right.

239
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,460
We have to stop Starlight

240
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,900
as soon as Rainbow Dash
and those bullies race by.

241
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,260
Um, Twilight...

242
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,440
So be ready.

243
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,900
I know, but...

244
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,780
Because she could
pop up anywhere.

245
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,100
Like over there?

246
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,820
Just remember
how you'd feel

247
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,720
if someone said
those things to you.

248
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,560
What's going on here?

249
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,440
Oh, I was just reminding
these two colts

250
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,620
how hurtful teasing can be.

251
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,180
Well, don't!

252
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,060
Huh?

253
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,080
I mean... You were?

254
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,340
Of course. In a world where
every pony is unique,

255
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,920
some are bound to feel
more special than others.

256
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,340
But that isn't a licence
to be cruel is it?

257
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,280
No. Of course not.

258
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,500
Isn't it a shame
we don't live in a world

259
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,580
where everypony is equal.

260
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,120
No one would ever tease anyone
there. Wouldn't that be nice?

261
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,440
Mm hm!

262
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,000
No. It wouldn't!

263
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,880
I mean, it'd be nice not
to be teased, of course,

264
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,700
but that's not the same thing.

265
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,060
Come on, Fluttershy.

266
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,560
Maybe I can help you get
through the course this time.

267
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,500
Well, I sure could
use the practice.

268
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,360
I know you only convinced those
bullies to not tease Fluttershy

269
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,460
to stop the Rainboom.

270
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,400
Oh, that's not true. I convinced
them not to be bullies

271
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,060
because everypony
should be equal.

272
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,840
Stopping the Rainboom
is just a bonus.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,520
Look!

274
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,280
This isn't over yet!

275
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,320
If you say so.

276
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,240
Hi!

277
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,320
Um, hi.

278
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,000
You think you can
stop for a minute?

279
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,900
Sure!

280
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I hear you're pretty fast.

281
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,040
Pretty fast? Please. I'm
even faster than that.

282
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,660
OK, so, um... Hey
you wanna race?

283
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,260
Um. That wouldn't
really be fair.

284
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,280
I mean, you're
a full grown pony.

285
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,020
And, wait, are
you an Alicorn?

286
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,120
Come on, I thought
you were fast.

287
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,380
Actually, I just remembered I
have somewhere I need to be.

288
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,500
OK, listen. You don't
have to race me.

289
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,840
I just need you to fly fast
enough for a Sonic Rainboom.

290
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,000
What? I can't do
that. Nopony can.

291
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,420
It's not even a real thing.
It's just an old mare's tale.

292
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,220
But it's not! I
know it's not.

293
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
I've seen you do it.
In the future!

294
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,080
OK. I'm gonna go now.

295
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,340
No! Wait!

296
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,780
Gee, Twilight.
What's the matter?

297
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,300
Couldn't convince her to do the
impossible? That's too bad.

298
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,860
Well, that
didn't work.

299
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,360
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

300
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,860
We'll have to try again.

301
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,400
Hey, Twilight.

302
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,460
I don't want to live in
that awful future we saw.

303
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,880
I don't think you'll have to.

304
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,180
Pinkie? Fluttershy?

305
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,700
SILENCE, CHANGELING!

306
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,980
All servants of Queen
Chrysalis found in these woods

307
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,640
must be destroyed!
