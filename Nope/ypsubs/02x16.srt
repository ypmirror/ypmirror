1
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:06,848
Hey Rarity, hey Pinkie Pie.
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:08,336
Rainbow Dash!

3
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:10,963
Isn't she the most daring devil?

4
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:13,292
I mean, the most devilish darer?
I mean...

5
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:15,183
She's dazzling!

6
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:18,937
Oh yeah, that's a good word.
She's dazzling!

7
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,644
- Oh no, oh no, oh no!
- Ayayayayay!

8
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,242
So much for dazzling...

12
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,027
<i>Is she gonna be okay?</i>

13
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:23,291
<i>I'm so worried!</i>

14
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:26,241
Is her face gonna stay that way?

15
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:36,385
- How is she, doctor?
- She's going to be fine.

16
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:39,280
Luckily, she has friends like you
who got her over here in a jiffy.

17
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:43,785
How long do I need to lie here?
I've got things I need to do!

18
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,944
Well, that all depends on your recovery.

19
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:47,569
But I'd say a few days minimum.

20
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,346
You guys have gotta get me out of here!

21
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:51,304
I'm gonna climb the walls!

22
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:52,920
Just like a spider!

23
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,993
Did the crash somehow give her
super-duper spider powers?

24
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:56,994
No.

25
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,557
Nor did it give her amazing
healing powers.

26
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,712
She needs to stay in bed for a few days.

27
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:05,846
Few days? Might as well be
a few months, or few years!

28
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:08,004
It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash.

29
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,559
I bet the chow in here
is hoof-lickin' good!

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,946
And the hospital gowns,
they match the curtains!

31
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:17,177
And look!
You have a roommate!

32
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:38,196
What's this?

33
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:42,702
"Daring Do and the Quest
for the Sapphire Stone."

34
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:44,828
This is the first story in the series.

35
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,236
I own all of them.

36
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:51,087
No thanks.
I so don't read.

37
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,950
I'm a world-class athlete.

38
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:55,516
Reading's for eggheads like you,
Twilight.

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,031
No offense, but I am not reading.

40
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:03,221
It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.

41
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:07,808
Is she serious?

42
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:10,641
Who doesn't like to read
a bang-up tale from time to time?

43
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:15,968
A good book is almost as magnificent as
silk pajamas on a Sunday morning.

44
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:19,100
Reading is for everypony,
Rainbow Dash!

45
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,459
Yeah! I love reading.

46
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,406
And my head isn't even close
to the shape of an egg!

47
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:25,302
It's more the shape of an apple,
or maybe an orange!

48
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:27,603
But a big orange,
more like a grapefruit really...

49
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:30,340
All right, my little ponies.

50
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,980
Rainbow Dash needs her rest.

51
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:34,021
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

52
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:39,032
I think you'd like Daring.
She's a lot like you.

53
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:45,539
Adventurous, fierce and undeniably,
unquestionably, unstoppable.

54
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:18,317
...to get to the other side!
Get it?

55
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,443
Nevermind...

56
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:57,060
As Daring-Do trekked through
the tropical jungle, the wet heat

57
00:04:57,061 --> 00:05:00,903
sapped her energy and
slowed her every step.

58
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:03,795
If only she could escape
this oppressive atmosphere

59
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:06,682
and fly up into the cool blue sky...

60
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:10,109
But her crash landing in the jungle
had injured her wing

61
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,046
and she was grounded for a few days.

62
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:16,914
Few days... it might as well be
a few months, or a few years!

63
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:19,301
I'm right there with you, sister.

64
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:22,182
The mosquitoes buzzed loudly.

65
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:24,980
<i>The macaws cried from the high trees.</i>

66
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:29,031
<i>Yet, all of these distracting noises
were not enough to cover the sound</i>

67
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:32,188
<i>of the predators following her every step.</i>

68
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:16,265
<i>Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally
allowed herself a moment to breathe.</i>

69
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:23,142
<i>She turned around to find herself
face to face with the long lost temple</i>

70
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:27,717
<i>that she had sought tirelessly
for over sixty days and nights!</i>

71
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:32,710
I hate to admit it to myself, and would
really hate to admit it to my friends

72
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:35,823
but... I love this story!

73
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,654
I love reading!

74
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:45,018
I'm an egghead.

75
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:57,444
<i>The smell of decay and danger
hit Daring-Do as she peered into</i>

76
00:06:57,445 --> 00:07:01,477
<i>the dimly-lit entrance
of the ancient temple.</i>

77
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:20,318
Hi Rainbow Dash!

78
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,952
Uh, hey, guys...

79
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,942
We thought we'd come and cheer you up!

80
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,691
We brought your favorite board game!

81
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,987
We know how much you like to win!

82
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,350
You go first, Rainbow Dash!

83
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,443
No no, you first.

84
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,052
Alright... cloud three.

85
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:47,506
Aw,shucks, you... rained on my cumulus.

86
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:48,807
Go again!

87
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:50,935
Sky five?

88
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:53,361
You found my seagull!

89
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:57,007
- Cloud two?
- You zapped my weather pony!

90
00:08:57,408 --> 00:09:00,749
You stung my bumblebee.
Oh, my thunderbolt.

91
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,701
And that's my last cloud.
You found it.

92
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,313
Guess you guys win, I lose.

93
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:10,415
But Rainbow Dash,
you didn't even get a turn.

94
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:13,294
You win some, you lose some.

95
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,676
But you don't lose some.

96
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:17,769
I don't think you've
ever lost a game of...

97
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,903
Thanks for coming!

98
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:21,600
But yesterday you were
desperate for things to do!

99
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,896
Do? Who said anything about Daring-Do?

100
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,321
I told you I'm not interested in reading.

101
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:29,646
It's nap time for me!

102
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:34,696
Glad we could... cheer you up?

103
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,802
Alright then.

104
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,377
Daring-Do stood at the entrance
to the central temple chamber.

105
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:58,612
<i>At last, she was face-to-face with
the legendary sapphire statue!</i>

106
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,715
There must be a pattern here.

107
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:20,788
What do all these animals have in common?

108
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,513
These animals are all predators!

109
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:29,879
Except... rats!

110
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,701
Hello, Rainbow Dash!

111
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,932
How's our patient doing today?

112
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:24,249
We need to get some fresh air in here.

113
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,140
You're lookin' sweatier than a pig
wrangler on a summer's day.

114
00:12:27,924 --> 00:12:30,739
Well, guys, thanks for visiting, but...

115
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,502
Okay, now, dinner time for Rainbow Dash.

116
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:39,222
Just in time.
I am so hungry.

117
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,147
Don't mind us, Rainbow Dash.

118
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,173
Yeah, just go ahead and eat up.

119
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:59,653
On second thought...

120
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,801
We'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash.

121
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:09,850
"You thought you could evade me
and capture the relic for yourself."

122
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:12,764
"But you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do."

123
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:17,286
And now, you shall meet your doom!

124
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:32,453
Who is this dude?

125
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:38,006
You won't get away with this, Ahuizotl!

126
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,454
But I already have...

127
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:46,105
Not again...

128
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,632
Quicksand!

129
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:09,420
<i>Rainbow Dash?</i>

130
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,238
<i>Rainbow Dash?</i>

131
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:15,015
Rainbow Daaaash?

132
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:20,473
- Oh, good evenin...
- Morning.

133
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:22,457
...morning, Doc.

134
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:25,893
Have you been up all night?

135
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:27,395
Of course not.

136
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:31,095
Well, I'll be quick.

137
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:34,301
Congratulations, Rainbow Dash,
we're checking you out of the hospital.

138
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:36,379
What?
Later today?

139
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,941
No.
Right now!

140
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:41,277
Right now?!
Right now, right now?

141
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:42,778
Right now, right now.

142
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,993
But I don't feel better!

143
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:47,997
Now take it easy, Rainbow Dash.

144
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:50,493
Remember to stay off
that wing for a week.

145
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:02,411
How will I ever find out
what happened to Daring-Do?!

146
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:08,092
Is Ahuizotl gonna get away
with the statuette?

147
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,385
What's gonna happen to Daring?!

148
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,379
Twilight has a copy of the book!

149
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,401
But I can't ask her after
I called her an egghead and all...

150
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:22,818
This is making me sick all over again!

151
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:32,913
The pain... the pain!

152
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,878
Rainbow Dash, what are you doing here?

153
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,879
Anything wrong?

154
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:39,611
My wing!
It's still hurting, Doc.

155
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,984
Ouch!
Right there.

156
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,403
I was touching your good wing.

157
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,386
Uh, right.

158
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:52,326
Well, I think that one's hurting now too.

159
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:55,782
I think I know what the trouble is.

160
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:58,974
A severe case of lazy-itis.

161
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,918
But, you got me all wrong, Doc!

162
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,456
I'm not being lazy!

163
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:05,115
You're fine, Rainbow Dash.

164
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:07,827
Give it some time and you'll be
right back in the swing of things.

165
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:09,696
Good day, Rainbow Dash.

166
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:10,697
Take care!

167
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,231
What am I gonna do?

168
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:16,803
I'll never get to sleep without knowing
what happens to Daring-Do!

169
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:21,509
Which may not be such a bad thing...

170
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:12,188
Feels like the harder I struggle,
the tighter the ropes get!

171
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,613
<i>Burglar, burglar!</i>

172
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:17,293
Someone's trying to steal my slippers!

173
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,438
I'm not trying to steal your slippers,
I'm trying to steal this book!

174
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:27,978
Stop, thief!

175
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:56,157
Hey, nopony invited me!

176
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,905
Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?

177
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,802
Rainbow Dash,
what in the world is going on?

178
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,393
Why are you stealing slippers?

179
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,217
Hey, get back to the hospital!

180
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,101
What's all the ruckus?

181
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:36,836
I'd say it's more of a fracas
than a ruckus.

182
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:39,297
What's going on, Rainbow Dash?

183
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:43,890
I'm an egghead.

184
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:45,191
Pardon?

185
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:49,276
See, I was trying to get back into
the hospital to finish the last chapter of...

186
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:52,460
"Daring-Do and the Quest
for the Sapphire Statue"!

187
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:53,861
You got me.

188
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,567
I knew the book was good,
but I didn't know it could drive

189
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,068
a pony to petty theft!

190
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:02,128
Good? Try awesomely amazing.

191
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:07,381
That book is undeniably,
unquestionably, un-put-down-able!

192
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:11,700
But then I had to put it down.
I was sent home before I could finish it.

193
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:14,039
Well, I'm glad that's all this is about.

194
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,619
There's no reason to go
around causin' a ruckus...

195
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,711
Fracas!

196
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:21,226
...causin' a fracas,
just because you like to read.

197
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:26,115
Like I said, I have
every book in the series.

198
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:28,741
And you can borrow them all,
any time you like!

199
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:31,408
Thanks, Twilight.

200
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,087
I'm sorry I made such a big deal
about all of this.

201
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,923
I thought reading was just
for smart ponies like you.

202
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:40,867
Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic
doesn't mean you aren't smart!

203
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,434
Yeah!
Just look at me!

204
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,676
Reading is something everypony can enjoy,
if they just give it a try.

205
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:54,377
Yeah, I get it.

206
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:57,087
I shouldn't knock something
until I've tried it.

207
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:58,588
That's a great lesson.

208
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:01,145
And it would make a great letter
to the Princess.

209
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:04,351
- Did you get all that?
- Yeah...?

210
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:05,352
Great!

211
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:07,820
You write the letter,
I've gotta finish this book!

212
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,543
Another day, another dungeon!

213
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:48,077
With Daring-Do out of the way,
the world will suffer mightily at my hands.

214
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:51,647
I am victorious!

215
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:57,772
I'll take that!

216
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:02,060
Wha...?
Noooooooo!

217
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,932
Better luck next time, Ahuizotl!

218
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:09,725
Curse you, Daring-Do!

219
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:16,714
And so, with Ahuizotl defeated,
and the sapphire statue secured...

220
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:19,959
...the world was safe and sound,
once again.

221
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,568
Thanks to Daring-Do!

222
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:29,827
Daring-Do and the Griffon's Goblet...

223
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:31,887
Awesome!
