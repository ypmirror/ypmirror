1
00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:01,728
Where'd I put that...?

2
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:03,521
Oh, I thought I already...

3
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:06,377
Oh! And I can't forget I've got to...

4
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:08,973
How am I ever gonna get this done?

5
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,942
Are you sure I can't help?

6
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:12,214
-I could...
-No.

7
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:13,885
-Maybe just a...
-No, thanks.

8
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:15,722
-How about...
-Just stand over there!

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,228
-But...
-...where you'll be out of the way.

10
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:22,652
Ribbon. Ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!

11
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,086
I got it!

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,582
Um... I'll just go and stand over there.

13
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,254
Where I'll be... out of the way.

14
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:38,060
Won't you at least let me
help you clean up?

15
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:40,803
No. You've helped me quite enough.

16
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:42,343
I'm sorry, sis.

17
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:44,235
I just thought that if I
could help...

18
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:48,351
...I might find my special gift
and finally earn my cutie mark.

19
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,296
I understand. It's just that...

20
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:55,042
I need this time to fill
this order without any...

21
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:56,892
...complications.

22
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,107
Okay. All done.

23
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:01,571
Now back to work.

24
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:04,864
I've lost a lot of time and I cannot
have any more interruptions.

25
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:07,465
WHAT NOW?!

26
00:02:07,806 --> 00:02:10,814
Oh! Sorry. I thought the "open" sign
meant you were open, but...

27
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:12,478
...I must have been mistaken.

28
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:14,481
Fluttershy! Forgive me.

29
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:19,085
I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you
were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming.

30
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,624
No worries, Rarity.
I've left her there in the basket.

31
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,165
Ooh, she looks great.

32
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,932
I just don't understand
how you're able to do it.

33
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,014
I can't get near her without
getting a swipe from her claws.

34
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:33,509
Did you use...

35
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:36,195
...the Stare on her?

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,104
Oh, no! I wouldn't. I couldn't!

37
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:42,991
I... I don't really have any control over
when that happens. It just happens.

38
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,893
No. I'm just good with animals.
It's my special gift, you know.

39
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:51,032
Well, you should have a picture of Opal
as a cutie mark, instead of those butterflies.

40
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,058
Ooh ooh oh oh!

41
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:55,090
Oh oh! Maybe I can be
good with animals too?

42
00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:59,366
Or not.

43
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:04,503
I'm sorry I can't invite you
to stay and chat, Fluttershy.

44
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:06,980
I've bitten off a bit more than
I can chew with this order.

45
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:08,687
But you're not eating anything.

46
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,092
No, sweetie. It's an expression.

47
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,653
It means that I've taken on
more work than I can handle.

48
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:16,243
I've got twenty of these
special robes to make tonight.

49
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:18,824
They're due in Trottingham
tomorrow morning.

50
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,338
See? I've lined them
in a special gold silk.

51
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:29,356
It took so long to make, but I think
it adds just the right touch, don't you?

52
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:32,479
These are lovely, but...
Twenty? By tonight?

53
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,429
How will you get it all done?

54
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,934
Well, I...

55
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:36,613
Oh oh oh!

56
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:37,832
Maybe I could...

57
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,864
...just... just stand
over here and watch?

58
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:43,211
I'll manage.

59
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:46,358
Well, maybe I should get out
of your mane, so you can work.

60
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,678
HI, FLUTTERSHY!

61
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,132
HI, RARITY!

62
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:51,158
Hello, uh... girls.

63
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,616
HEY, SWEETIE BELLE!

64
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,618
Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!

65
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:58,680
-You ready for tonight?
-Yep! Cutie mark planning session is a go!

66
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:01,683
Tonight is the night we each try
to find our own special talent.

67
00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:03,617
Even if it takes us all night!

68
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,265
I'm ready. You ready?

69
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,455
Very ready!

70
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:10,201
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS'
SLEEPOVER AT RARITY'S! YAY!

71
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:12,783
Aaand... look what I made us!

72
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,239
Wow!

73
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:19,572
That does that patch on your cape mean?

74
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:22,773
THE CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!
YAY!

75
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:24,893
We're on a crusade! A mission!

76
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:26,703
To find our cutie marks!

77
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:28,110
Yup. And look.

78
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:30,330
I lined them with
this special gold silk.

79
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:32,069
It took so long to make...

80
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,286
...but I think it adds just
the right touch. Don't you?

81
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,863
Sweetie Belle! What have you done?!

82
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,774
That was the last of the gold silk!
And now I'll have to make more!

83
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,588
Oh, I hope I can make more.

84
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,391
I'm gonna have to work all night!

85
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:50,966
Which means...

86
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,865
Sorry, girls. I'm afraid
the crusaders' sleepover is canceled.

87
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:55,862
WHAT?!

88
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:59,752
I just won't have any time to watch you
if I want to get these robes delivered on time.

89
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:00,340
But...!

90
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,082
No "buts" this time.

91
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,803
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle.
It's just the way it has to be.

92
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,900
I, uh... I suppose I could
take them for the night.

93
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,387
I couldn't ask you to do that.

94
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:16,056
Oh, it's no problem at all.

95
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:19,817
Have you met my sister and her friends?
A problem is all it would be.

96
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:24,881
Did I have a problem with Opal?
You've seen how well I handle small creatures.

97
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:27,851
I suppose that's true.
And I do have a lot of work to do.

98
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:29,301
Come on. It'll be fun.

99
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:31,213
I assure you they're quite a handful.

100
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,116
These sweet little angels?

101
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:36,295
Well...

102
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,058
All right.

103
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:42,076
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS' SLEEPOVER
AT FLUTTERSHY'S COTTAGE!

104
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:42,924
YAY!

105
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,552
So cute.

106
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:46,233
Wait for me!

107
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:54,511
Oh. Won't this be ever so fun?

108
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:56,544
We can have a nice little tea party...

109
00:05:56,545 --> 00:06:00,262
...and braid each other's tails,
and sit quietly, and color...

110
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:02,273
...tell each other fairy tales, and...

111
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,170
Hello, Fluttershy.

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,546
Oh. Hello, Twilight. Where you off to?

113
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:17,411
I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's
to get some of my favorite tea.

114
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,862
T-The Everfree Forest?

115
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:22,431
You'll be careful, won't you?

116
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:25,268
Of course. How about you?
What are you doing with the girls?

117
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:27,586
Rarity has a big order
to fill tonight...

118
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,069
...so I volunteered to take the girls
over to my cottage for a sleepover.

119
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,613
Wow. Sounds like everypony
has their hooves full today.

120
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:37,775
Taking care of those
three fillies all by yourself?

121
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:39,169
You sure you can handle it?

122
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,891
What? These sweet little angels?

123
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:44,945
They'll be no problem at all.

124
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,902
Wow! Look at this place!

125
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:59,468
No... problem at all.

126
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,657
Okay, girls. What should we do?

127
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:03,170
I'm gonna get my mark first!

128
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,570
-Girls...?
-Nuh-uh.

129
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,064
-Should we...?
-I am!

130
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,261
Girls. O-okay now, sit down...

131
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,556
I'm staying up all night!

132
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:11,012
-Me too!
-Me three!

133
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:13,811
Uh... I know you're excited, but...

134
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:15,163
Girls.

135
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:16,965
Oh. Oh, careful with the...

136
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:17,905
Oh!

137
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:19,340
Girls.

138
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,379
So... What do you wanna do? Play a game?

139
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,763
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

140
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:30,416
And we want to crusade
for our cutie marks!

141
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,955
And... And we... Um...

142
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,601
Yeah! What they said.

143
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:39,565
I don't know. How about a nice,
*quiet* little tea party?

144
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:43,627
Or... we could go adventuring
in the Everfree Forest!

145
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:44,983
YEAH!

146
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:49,449
Oh, no! The Everfree Forest
is much too dangerous.

147
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,395
It's filled with far too many
strange creatures.

148
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:55,361
But you could go with us and
we could catch those creatures.

149
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:56,618
We could be...

150
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:58,893
...creature catchers!

151
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:03,227
YAY! CUTIE MARK CRUSADER
CREATURE CATCHERS!

152
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:11,895
Rawr! I am a dangerous creature
from the Everfree Forest! Rawr!

153
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,696
Halt, dangerous creature
of the Everfree Forest!

154
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:20,489
I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher.
And I'm here to catch you!

155
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,569
You can never catch me!
I am far too powerful and dangerous.

156
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,568
You cannot run from me!

157
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,945
Um... Oh, maybe that's not such a...

158
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:38,634
Now, girls. How about we
do some nice coloring?

159
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:42,822
Come back, dangerous creature,
so I can catch you!

160
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:43,911
Never!

161
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,610
Careful... you don't...

162
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,344
...break anything.

163
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,084
Sorry, Fluttershy.

164
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,664
Yeah. Sorry.

165
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:57,306
I guess we aren't creature catchers.

166
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,237
Oh, girls. It's okay. I...

167
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,778
I know! We could be...

168
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,972
Cutie Mark Crusader Carpenters!

169
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:04,557
Carpenter...?

170
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,203
Hammer.

171
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:10,022
Hammer.

172
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:12,634
Hammer.

173
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:13,645
Hammer.

174
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:16,309
Hammer.

175
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,007
Hammer.

176
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:30,201
Um... That doesn't look like a table.

177
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,892
We were making a table?

178
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:34,723
Somepony needs to put
this thing out of its misery.

179
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,708
We are definitely not
Cutie Mark Carpenters.

180
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:40,208
Who wants a picture of a hammer
on their flank anyway?

181
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:44,783
Well... Now that we've gotten that
out of the way, how about a game?

182
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,920
A game?

183
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,465
It's called "Shhh!"

184
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,846
What's that?

185
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:53,806
Well, it's a game about who can be
quiet the longest. Sound fun?

186
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:58,640
I'm the world champ, you know?
I bet you can't beat me.

187
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,880
-I lose!
-Me too!
-Me three!

188
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,750
Okay! Now what could we do?

189
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:12,102
Oh! How about Cutie Mark
Crusader Coal Miners?

190
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:13,268
YEAH!

191
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:14,331
No!

192
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,953
Awww...!

193
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:18,678
I mean... it's time for bed,
don't you think?

194
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,292
Aren't you excited to get all toasty and
warm in your snuggly-wuggly wittle beds?

195
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,277
"Snuggly-wuggly"?

196
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,471
But we have more crusadin' to do!

197
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:29,137
We've got plans!

198
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,641
And capes!

199
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:34,634
Uh... Okay. Um, maybe
the crusading can wait until morning?

200
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,501
When it's light and not so... dark?

201
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:41,173
How are we gonna find
our special talent in our sleep?

202
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:45,572
Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream
about your special talent.

203
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,256
But we're not even tired!

204
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:50,593
How about I sing you a lullaby?

205
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:51,668
-Mhm...
-Yeah!

206
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:57,880
<i>Hush now, quiet now,
It's time to lay your sleepy head.</i>

207
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:03,523
<i>Hush now, quiet now,
It's time to go to bed.</i>

208
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:05,275
I know this one!

209
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,652
Oh, how wonderful.

210
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:09,137
Why don't you sing it with me?

211
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:17,015
<i>Hush now, quiet now,
This is time to lay your sleepy head!</i>

212
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:20,704
<i>Said hush now, quiet now,
This is time to go to bed!</i>

213
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,058
Okay, Sweetie, that was...

214
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:25,821
<i>Drifting (drifting!) off to sleep!
The exciting day behind you!</i>

215
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:29,474
<i>Drifting (drifting!) off to sleep!
Let the joy of dreamland find you!</i>

216
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:30,729
Thank you, Sweetie, I'm...

217
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,084
<i>Hush now! Quiet now!
Lay your sleepy head!</i>

218
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:40,317
<i>Said hush now! Quiet now!
This is time to go to bed!!!</i>

219
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:41,264
OW!

220
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:44,941
What is that?

221
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:52,430
Girls!

222
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:55,217
Fluttershy! Your chickens
are on the loose.

223
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:58,467
I wonder what could have caused that.

224
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:03,561
Don't worry, Fluttershy.
The Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this.

225
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,364
Cutie Mark Crusader Chicken Herders!

226
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:08,488
-YAY!
-No! I don't think that's a...

227
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:09,690
Come back!

228
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,848
Please!

229
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,842
Come on, girls. The chickens are fine.

230
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,066
Oh... Girls? No...

231
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:18,199
GIRLS!

232
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,408
Come on.

233
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:27,499
In you go.

234
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,870
There's some good chickens.

235
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:46,911
Okay. You three. Isn't it
about time you got into bed?

236
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:47,732
BUT...

237
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,158
Please.

238
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:55,302
So, no more crusading
for tonight, all right?

239
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,678
Yes, Fluttershy.

240
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,081
We promise, Fluttershy.

241
00:12:58,082 --> 00:12:59,326
Good night, Fluttershy.

242
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:01,436
Okay. Good night.

243
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:07,158
Okay. So what kind of
crusading do we do next?

244
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,314
There's not much we
can do from this room.

245
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:12,872
Unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader
Carpet Cleaners.

246
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:15,129
Nnno, thanks.

247
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,462
Well, we have to think of somethin'.

248
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,226
We can't just waste this opportunity
to find out what our special talents are.

249
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:22,710
Hey, girls!

250
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:24,043
Look!

251
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:26,840
Some of the chickens may have escaped.

252
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:28,935
Into the forest!

253
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,786
Cutie Mark Crusaders
Chicken Rescuers are go!

254
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,918
It really wasn't that hard.

255
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,250
I mean, all I needed to do is just
show them who's in charge.

256
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,414
Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy.

257
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:47,088
Good with animals, good with kids.

258
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:53,750
Wait up!

259
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,561
Peace and quiet.

260
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:00,824
Too quiet.

261
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:06,148
Girls?

262
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:09,094
Girls?

263
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:12,174
Elizabeak! She's missing!

264
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:13,464
Girls?

265
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:14,926
Oh no!

266
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:17,875
They must have gone looking
for my missing chicken!

267
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:20,338
Which means they must have gone into...

268
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,920
...the Everfree Forest!

269
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,887
Those girls have really
done it this time.

270
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:31,678
They've really bitten off
more than they can chew.

271
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:33,787
Just like me.

272
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:36,321
I never should have
offered to watch them.

273
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,832
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!

274
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:51,259
What are you doing?

275
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,963
Callin' for the chicken.

276
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:55,314
That is not how you call a chicken.

277
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:57,621
Oh, and you know how to call a chicken.

278
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,569
I know that's not the way.

279
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,655
Then show me.

280
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:03,474
I don't have to show you.

281
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:05,532
You're just chicken.

282
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:06,983
AM NOT!

283
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:09,767
Oh, wait! Now I know
how to call a chicken.

284
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:13,562
Scootaloo! Scoot-Scootaloo!

285
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:16,060
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

286
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,948
You also forgot how to call a chicken.

287
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,559
Why, you...!

288
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,670
Come on, guys.

289
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,654
We're not gonna find the chicken
*or* our cutie marks by arguing.

290
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:30,848
Maybe that's our
special talent? Arguing!

291
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,766
-Is not!
-Is too!

292
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,875
-Is not!
-Is too! Anything yet?

293
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,204
No.

294
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,515
Darn...

295
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,739
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick!

296
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:47,483
Girls?

297
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,505
Girls!

298
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,276
Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy.

299
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,877
Just put one hoof in front of the other.

300
00:15:58,111 --> 00:15:59,142
What was that?!

301
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:07,507
Twilight? Is that you?

302
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:11,301
Oh, Twilight. It is you.

303
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:13,741
Thank goodness you're here. I need your help.

304
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:16,163
The girls are out here somewhere
and I'm afraid that they're...

305
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,142
W-What's happened to you?

306
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:26,417
Oh no! If you've been turned
to stone, it must mean...

307
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,294
Oh no! The girls!

308
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,650
Don't move. I'll be back for you.

309
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,088
Girls!

310
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:35,380
-Is not!
-Is too!

311
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:37,082
-Is not!
-Is too!

312
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,493
Girls! Our special talent is *not* arguing.

313
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:45,678
Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony
whose talent is arguing even look like?

314
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,692
Girls! Girls!

315
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,077
Fluttershy?

316
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:52,192
Girls! Thank goodness I've found you.

317
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:53,527
Fluttershy? What...

318
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:55,977
Girls! We have to leave
the forest at once!

319
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:58,083
But... we haven't found the chicken yet.

320
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:01,048
There's no time for that.
There's a cockatrice on the loose.

321
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:02,978
A cock-a-what now?

322
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:06,562
A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with
a head of a chicken and the body of a snake.

323
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:07,795
Now come on!

324
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,451
The head of a chicken
and the body of a snake?

325
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:13,057
That doesn't sound scary.
That sounds silly.

326
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:16,491
Why, if I ever saw one of them
cock-a-thingies face to face...

327
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,685
...I'd laugh at how silly it was.

328
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,874
No! Never look one in the eye.

329
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,687
-If you look the cockatrice in the eye...
-The chicken!

330
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:25,109
Girls! Wait!

331
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,852
HERE, CHICK-CHICK-CHICK!

332
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,121
There it is!

333
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:36,950
Two chickens?

334
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:39,236
I thought only one escaped.

335
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:40,574
Grab them both!

336
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,133
See? Now we have to...

337
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,729
Girls. Please... Girls.

338
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,513
Listen to me, girls, I... Please!

339
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,387
Girls!

340
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:29,188
Behind me, now!

341
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:37,691
YOU!

342
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:41,717
Just who do you think you are,
going around turning others into stone?

343
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,480
You should be ashamed of yourself!

344
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:50,636
I am half a mind to find your mother and
tell her what you've been up to, young man.

345
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:57,932
Now you go over there and turn Elizabeak
and my friend Twilight back to normal.

346
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,946
And don't ever let me
catch you doing this again!

347
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:07,089
Do you understand me?

348
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,991
Are you girls all right?
I was so worried.

349
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:14,482
Yeah! Fine!

350
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,700
Thanks to that stare of yours.

351
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:19,052
You're, like, the queen of stares!

352
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:21,324
You're the Stare Master!

353
00:19:21,673 --> 00:19:24,924
We're sorry we snuck out of
the house and into the forest.

354
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:27,475
Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.

355
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:28,891
We promise.

356
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:32,898
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, you better or I'll give you...

357
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,431
...the Stare!

358
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:46,254
What... What happened?

359
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,293
And that's when it brought
you back from stone.

360
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,758
This is gonna make quite
a letter to the Princess.

361
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,319
I was wrong about you.

362
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,028
You certainly do know
how to handle those girls.

363
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:03,761
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

364
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:05,628
Hmm? How so?

365
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:08,957
I assumed that I'd be just as good
with kids as I am with animals.

366
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,825
Boy, was I wrong.

367
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:14,521
I really learned the hard way not to
bite off more than I could chew.

368
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:16,078
You and Rarity both.

369
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:17,759
Good morning, Rarity!

370
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,044
Did you finish all those capes?

371
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,803
Just delivered them.

372
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:26,006
I have to admit. If you hadn't
come along, I might not have.

373
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,344
Thanks again.

374
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:29,650
Won't you stay for some tea?

375
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:32,329
I really must get back
to the shop and clean up.

376
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,615
Girls, get your things. Time to go.

377
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:36,553
Girls!

378
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:39,022
Girls! Time...

379
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:42,114
Girls! Your things!

380
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:43,834
Girls...!

381
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,391
It's time to...

382
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:47,537
GIRLS!

383
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,629
Allow me.

384
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:50,480
Girls.

385
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:55,102
-Yes, Fluttershy?
-You called?

386
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:58,216
Go and get your things.
Rarity is here to see you home.

387
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,473
Of course, Fluttershy. Right away.

388
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:04,237
Ho... How did you...
How did you do that?

389
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:09,502
I guess I'm just as good
with kids as I am with animals.

390
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:17,445
Uh... Speaking of which,
I could use your help with Opal.

391
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,952
Of course. How about later today?

392
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,913
How about... now?

393
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,166
