1
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,676
This just got real.

2
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:30,907
Listen up, gang.

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,518
We're almost there so I've
got a few things to say.

4
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:37,203
First off, who here besides
me thinks this is the best

5
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:40,163
Equestria Games delegation
in Ponyville history?

6
00:00:44,284 --> 00:00:46,015
And no matter what
your sport is,

7
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,381
we've gotta give it our best

8
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,692
because we've all got a genuine
shot at Ponyville gold!

9
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:57,080
With the possible
exception of Bulk Biceps,

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,671
Fluttershy and me.

11
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,304
I mean, we're good and all, but
we're up against the Wonderbolts

12
00:01:02,318 --> 00:01:05,430
in the aerial relay, so
gold's kind of a stretch.

13
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,661
Let's not kid ourselves.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,433
Don't feel bad, Rainbow Dash.

15
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:11,178
We have absolutely no shot
at winning gold, either!

16
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:14,199
Uh, that's because you're
carrying the flag for Ponyville

17
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,465
in the opening ceremony.

18
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:16,522
There are no winners.

19
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:20,234
Winners or not, we still have
the chance to be awesome!

20
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:21,586
That's the spirit.

21
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:22,942
You hear that, everypony?

22
00:01:23,272 --> 00:01:26,860
Winners or not, we all still
have the chance to be awesome!

23
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,524
But uh, let's
still try to win

24
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:34,236
lots and lots of stuff too, OK?

25
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,770
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu</i>

26
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,505
Phew! It's all in there, gang.

27
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,760
Leave it to Spike,
champion gear carrier,

28
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,589
for all your
gear-carrying needs.

29
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:39,104
And the Ponyville flag?
You sure?

30
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,390
And what about the flagpole?

31
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:41,857
In with the portable ramp.

32
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:42,995
<i>Whoa!</i>

33
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,835
Give it a rest,
Applebloom.

34
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,807
Aw she's just nervous,
that's all.

35
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:47,988
Perfectly understandable.

36
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,772
Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget
something and I start to panic,

37
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,340
I have a simple
trick: I count to ten,

38
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,765
and by the time I'm done,
I've calmed myself enough

39
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:57,763
to get the job done
right every time.

40
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,030
Easy peasy cider squeezy.

41
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:00,833
<i>Hey!</i>

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,854
Put me down!

43
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,136
What's going on?

44
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:12,606
Spike! Are you
all right?

45
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:15,170
A thousand pardons, O
Great and Honorable Spike

46
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:16,571
the Brave and Glorious.

47
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,513
Huh? Who the what now?

48
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:20,489
Thanks for bringing
Spike to us.

49
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:23,627
It's OK, Spike.

50
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:26,119
We'll have our hoofponies
go back for your bags.

51
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:29,810
Can they hang back a sec and
tell me what's going on first?

52
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:35,687
Mm mm!

53
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:39,016
So the ponies here think
I'm some kind of hero, huh?

54
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:40,480
More of the green ones, please.

55
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:41,812
I like the green ones.

56
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:44,649
<i>Last time you were here,</i>

57
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:46,698
you got the Crystal Heart
to Princess Cadance

58
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:49,660
in time to save this entire
empire from destruction.

59
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:51,929
You are known
throughout my empire

60
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:56,163
as Great and Honorable
Spike the Brave and Glorious.

61
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:57,504
Isn't that awesome?

62
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,471
You're a big shot here, Spike.

63
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:01,346
See that?

64
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:02,503
<i>That's you!</i>

65
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:05,371
Hello, gorgeous.

66
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:08,294
This is why we all hope
you'd do us the honor

67
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,805
of lighting the torch at
the opening ceremony.

68
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,903
You'd be the very
first dragon

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,001
in the history of the
Equestria Games to do so.

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,699
Of course, I'll do it!

71
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:20,279
And bonus: I can do it
with my fire breath.

72
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,796
Places for the
procession, everypony.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,120
Two minutes!

74
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,847
And you're quite certain

75
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,764
you also understand exactly what
you're supposed to do?

76
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:11,514
I stand where you tell me
until you give me the signal.

77
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:13,393
And then I walk over
and light the torch.

78
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,650
Mm. Couldn't be simpler.

79
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,642
Mr. The Dragon? Are you coming?

80
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,615
Honestly.

81
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,760
Would somepony help him walk?

82
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:49,451
Now please welcome the
delegation from Ponyville!

83
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:52,513
Ponyville forever! YAY!

84
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,013
Awesome!

85
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:54,889
yay

86
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,476
Yeah!

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,317
Whoo hoo!

88
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:19,539
This is the signal.

89
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:25,642
I'm giving you the signal now.

90
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,928
Mr. The Dragon!

91
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,800
Come on, Spike.

92
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:42,948
Calm yourself.

93
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:44,056
Count to ten.

94
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:49,217
One, two, three, thousand,
fourteen thousand,

95
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,877
twenty thousand,
thirty thousand!

96
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:56,515
What's wrong?

97
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:01,767
Tell me this isn't happening.

98
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:11,092
Equestria, we
have a problem.

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,564
Mr. The Dragon, would you
light the torch already?

100
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,677
I don't know what it is, but I
just don't have the stuff today.

101
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,001
Did you bring a match?

102
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:32,952
You're a fire-breathing dragon.

103
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:35,884
Then some cough drops, maybe?

104
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,364
Never mind.

105
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,543
I'll keep trying.

106
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,153
Somepony go down and help him!

107
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:50,883
Light! Light!

108
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:09,508
Phew!

109
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:12,152
How did you do that?

110
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,038
I'm...not sure.

111
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,945
Ah well, better
late than never.

112
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:22,655
Let the Games begin!

113
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,505
Oh! There are our
little superstars!

114
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:40,856
You were fabulous!

115
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,744
Made me sit up proud like
a cornstalk in August.

116
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:45,912
Ya done good, squirt.

117
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,758
You three
really were wonderful.

118
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,366
But does anypony know what
was going on with Spike?

119
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,028
He sure seemed to be havin'
a tough time of it out there.

120
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,225
He put things right
in time, though.

121
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,948
Actually, it was me.

122
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,041
I didn't want him
to be embarrassed,

123
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,693
so I cast a secret spell
to light it for him.

124
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:05,289
Oh dear. Have you
told him?

125
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,943
No, but he might have
figured it out on his own.

126
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,113
You gotta tell him just in case.

127
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,899
I know. I'm just afraid
of how he'll take it.

128
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,190
I know what pride he
takes in a job well done.

129
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,720
Psst. Here he
comes now.

130
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:18,378
Act casual.

131
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:21,153
'Sup.

132
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,115
Spike! Is everything OK?

133
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,234
I guess. I don't know!

134
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:28,109
The weirdest thing
happened down there.

135
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,302
Yeah, about that. I--

136
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:32,474
I mean, there I was,
trying to light the torch,

137
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,019
with all of Equestria watching,

138
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:36,314
and feeling like the
hugest failure ever.

139
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,188
And then the thing just
lit. It was amazing!

140
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,378
Oh! Phew! I was afraid
you'd be upset.

141
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:46,037
Upset? Are you kidding? Why
would I be upset to discover

142
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,239
I can light fire with my mind?

143
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,686
Huh?

144
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:52,661
Look! It's the Great
and Honorable Spike

145
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:53,845
the Brave and Glorious!

146
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:55,221
Can we get your autograph?

147
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,468
Sure!

148
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,849
How you saved our empire
last time you were here

149
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,393
was really amazing.

150
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:03,822
Aw. You know what
else is amazing?

151
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,346
Watch this!

152
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:15,500
Don't worry. Once it bursts
into flames through brainpower,

153
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,422
I'll sign another one
for you. Promise.

154
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:28,005
Spike, may I have
a word with you a moment?

155
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:32,003
Better be careful with that.
Might burst into flames later.

156
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:33,324
Delayed reaction.

157
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,700
Hey Twi, what is it?

158
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:39,623
Hold on, hold on!
Give me a second.

159
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,216
If I can set fire to
stuff with my mind,

160
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,616
mindreading must be
just around the corner,

161
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,754
and I predict that you
are about to ask me

162
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:51,482
to set fire to something
with my mind!

163
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,476
No. Because you can't.

164
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,746
Oh really? So how do you explain
what happened down there

165
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:59,147
in front of thousands
and thousands--

166
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:02,429
I did it, Spike. I cast a
spell to do it for you.

167
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:06,372
... in front of thousands
and thousands...

168
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,208
I'm sorry, Spike.

169
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,725
I just couldn't stand to
see you stuck like that.

170
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:12,913
You understand, don't you?

171
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:17,317
I, uh...I need to be
alone right now.

172
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:18,864
Spike?

173
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:26,001
O Great and Honorable Spike
the Brave and Glorious.

174
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:27,937
Can I get your autograph?

175
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:31,461
Sorry. You should probably
ask somebody special instead.

176
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:41,344
<i>Our next event:</i>
<i>the aerial relay!</i>

177
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,687
That's Dash and Fluttershy!

178
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:46,439
Oh no, we can't
be late for that!

179
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:49,783
Miss, step right over here.

180
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,526
<i>Unicorns will no</i>
<i>longer be admitted</i>

181
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,951
<i>without a disabling spell.</i>

182
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,631
To prevent cheating.

183
00:11:57,832 --> 00:11:59,678
And make sure you don't
even try casting a spell

184
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,718
<i>or we'll know it.</i>

185
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:05,830
Hmph!

186
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:24,427
If Ponyville medals here
we'll have 8 medals so far,

187
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,655
putting us tied for the
lead with Cloudsdale.

188
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,582
Unless Cloudsdale
medals here, too.

189
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:39,120
Ms. Harshwhinny, I know
you're really busy but--

190
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:40,610
What is it?

191
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,712
Maybe there's something else I
can do for the Games, you know,

192
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:45,996
something really worthy of the
Crystal Empire's admiration?

193
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:48,321
What are you talking about?

194
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,474
You lit the torch
for the whole thing!

195
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,783
Well, actually, that
wasn't really--

196
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:56,023
That wasn't "worthy"
enough for you?

197
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,918
For ponies' sake!

198
00:12:58,158 --> 00:13:01,092
Next thing you know, you'll be
asking to put on a rock concert!

199
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,463
Agh! Celebrities.

200
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,016
Wait. That's it!

201
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:15,834
Second place!

202
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,170
We got silver!

203
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:25,352
Congratulations to
all our medalists.

204
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:27,449
And now, the anthem of--

205
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,691
And I shall do the
honor of singing!

206
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:35,791
Spike? What are
you doing?

207
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,058
You know how they always
just play the music?

208
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,337
Well, I know all the
words to our anthem

209
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:43,299
and will sing them for you
now, loud and proud,

210
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:45,036
<i>to the enjoyment of all!</i>

211
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,855
And now, um, the Cloudsdale
anthem, as sung by Spike.

212
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,352
Wait, the Cloudsdale anthem?

213
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,212
They only play the anthem
for the winners, Spike.

214
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:04,124
The Wonderbolts are
from Cloudsdale!

215
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,363
But I don't know the words
to the Cloudsdale anthem.

216
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:09,016
I've never even heard it!

217
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:14,874

243
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:36,840
Spike, you coming?

244
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:39,968
Nah, I got this
stuff to pack up.

245
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:43,459
But you've been moping in here
for almost the entire Games.

246
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:45,549
And tonight's the
closing ceremony.

247
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,115
Which means we leave tomorrow.
Ergo the packing.

248
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:03,190
And so the Games conclude
as they always do

249
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,078
with the Ice Archery finals.

250
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:10,078
<i>Ice archers, take your places!</i>

251
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:14,946
Too bad Ponyville doesn't have
any ice archers competing.

252
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:16,794
We don't have
anyone to root for.

253
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:17,621
It's OK.

254
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:20,610
Ponyville has 37 medals
and Cloudsdale 36,

255
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,504
so looks like we'll be medal
champs of the Games anyway!

256
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:24,421
Whoo hoo!

257
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:27,047
But Cloudsdale has two
ice archery finalists

258
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,243
down there right now.

259
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,916
<i>If they both place, Cloudsdale</i>
<i>wins the medal count.</i>

260
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,872
So you're saying it all
comes down to this one event?

261
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:36,130
Pretty much.

262
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:38,546
<i>Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!</i>
<i>Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!</i>

263
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,667
Twilight! Come take this
extra seat next to me

264
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:44,374
and freak out over
the medal count.

265
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:45,467
I'll show you how.

266
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:47,560
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

267
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,559
Actually I was
looking for Spike.

268
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:50,558
Have you seen him?

269
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:51,715
He wouldn't come.

270
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,336
We tried to talk him into it.

271
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,848
But he wouldn't listen.

272
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,710
You can have his
extra seat, though.

273
00:16:58,343 --> 00:16:59,683
Uh...Twi?

274
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,619
<i>Spike? You here?</i>

275
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,289
Uh, yeah. I'm super busy.

276
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:15,697
Look at all this
packing left to do.

277
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:16,741
Crazy, right?

278
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:19,736
No more hiding out.
You're coming with me.

279
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:20,874
Now.

280
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:25,541
OK, fine. I'll come. Can
I at least wear these?

281
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,028
Those aren't your
average arrows.

282
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:35,588
<i>They freeze whatever part</i>
<i>of the target they hit.</i>

283
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:39,484
<i>Whoever encases their entire</i>
<i>target in ice first wins.</i>

284
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:42,737
<i>Keep your eye on</i>
<i>Number 7 from Cloudsdale.</i>

285
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,216
<i>He's the favorite.</i>

286
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,715
Honestly Spike, I don't
see why you're being

287
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:52,858
so hard on yourself.

288
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:55,783
I let everypony down. Twice!

289
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,639
You never let anypony down

290
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:59,272
so you have no idea
what that's like.

291
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:02,003
Are you kidding? I've
totally let ponies down.

292
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,289
That's not the point.

293
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:06,751
The torch got lit; the aerial
relay teams got their medals.

294
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,120
No harm no foul.

295
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:10,878
Can we at least watch
from inside there?

296
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,670
I'm not sure I'm ready to face
crowds in the stands just yet.

297
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:34,202
NO!

298
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,888
Steer it towards the field!

299
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,475
Away from the crowds!

300
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,781
Somepony cut the
disabling spell!

301
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:47,159
There isn't time!

302
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,814
Dash! Fluttershy! MOVE!

303
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,372
That was awesome!

304
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:24,667
I just wanted to
thank you personally

305
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:27,274
for saving those ponies,
and the Games,

306
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:30,421
O Great and Honorable Spike
the Brave and Glorious.

307
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,448
You must be very proud.

308
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,550
I guess.

309
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,152
You guess?

310
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,696
I just saw what needed
to be done and reacted.

311
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:40,915
It just so happens
I can breathe fire.

312
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,367
If any of you could do that,
you'd have done the same.

313
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:45,354
Forgive me for
being blunt, Spike,

314
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,510
but you're not makin'
a lick of sense.

315
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:49,629
It's just how I feel.

316
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:52,353
Wait a second. I
think I get it.

317
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,519
You keep saying you
let everypony down.

318
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,368
But we all keep
saying you didn't.

319
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,605
You know who was disappointed
in you, Spike? You.

320
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:02,380
And only you can make
it right with you again.

321
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:04,247
<i>What would that take, Spike?</i>

322
00:20:05,557 --> 00:20:08,044
I don't know. Can
you turn back time?

323
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:11,525
Cause I'd sure like a do-over
on that opening ceremony.

324
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:13,551
We can't turn back time.

325
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,819
But would you do me
the great honor

326
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,835
<i>of lighting fireworks</i>
<i>in my place</i>

327
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:20,688
<i>at the closing</i>
<i>ceremonies tonight?</i>

328
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:22,076
Come on, Spike.

329
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,647
You've saved the
Crystal Empire. Twice.

330
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:27,211
I think you can
light some fireworks.

331
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:32,095
I guess I have to at
least give it a shot.

332
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:40,837
We did it!

333
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:42,819
Ponyville won the medal count!

334
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:44,786
And only by one medal.

335
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,314
Hmm. Wonder which
medal that was?

336
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:49,445
Bam!

337
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,014
How's it feel to have opened
the best Equestria Games

338
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:54,524
in Ponyville history, Squirt?

339
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,059
Probably as good as it
feels to close them.

340
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,154
OK, it's time.

341
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,693
<i>You know, it's kinda weird;</i>

342
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,228
no matter how many times others
<i>tell you you're great,</i>

343
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,329
<i>all the praise in</i>
<i>the world means nothing</i>

344
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:13,836
<i>if you don't feel it inside.</i>

345
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,641
<i>Sometimes, to feel</i>
<i>good about yourself,</i>

346
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:22,247
<i>you've got to let</i>
<i>go of the past.</i>

347
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,523
<i>That way, when the time comes</i>
<i>to let your greatness fly,</i>

348
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:29,032
<i>you'll be able to</i>
<i>light up the whole sky.</i>
