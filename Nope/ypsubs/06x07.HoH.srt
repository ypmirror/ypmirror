Hey! Rainbow Dash!

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,820
Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up?

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,210
The Rainbow Dash fan
club just decided

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,120
everypony's coming to see you
when the Wonderbolts' new tour

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,280
comes through Ponyville!

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,840
Well, it's great that you guys
are going to the show, Scoot,

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,160
but I won't actually
be performing in it.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,580
Reservists aren't
in the show

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,720
unless one of the real
Wonderbolts can't fly.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,920
I'll probably be working
crowd control or something.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,720
You're still gonna be
wearing a Wonderbolts uniform

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,380
though, right?

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,800
A Reservist one, yeah.

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,440
Hmm. That's good
enough for me!

00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,200

00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,480
Whoa!

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,750
Rainbow Dash! Glad
we found you.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,560
We need you in the show when
we get to Ponyville. Flying.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,260
But she's only
in the Reserves!

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,100
Not anymore, kid.

24
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,620
[gasp] You mean...

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,220
[gasp]

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Rainbow Dash! You're finally
a full-fledged Wonderbolt!

Rainbow Dash! Woo!

Uh, anypony see my wing
balm? I don't wanna be stiff

31
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,680
when I show up at
Wonderbolt headquarters.

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,140
Got it.

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,580
Do you have time to tell us
what happened, Rainbow Dash?

34
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,170
Ooo yes, we must
know every detail!

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,740
Start from when you were
a foal and you first knew

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,300
your destiny was to
become a Wonderbolt!

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,580
[chuckle] Well, not
much to tell, really.

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,780
Spitfire told me the
Wonderbolts need me

39
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,180
to go on tour with them.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,880
That's really great.

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,640
I know how long you've been
waiting for a spot to open up.

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah, Fire Streak decided to
retire and teach full-time.

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,760
Cloudsdale Flight School will
probably be churning out

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,900
Wonderbolts with him there.

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,200
But guess who was at the
top of the Reserve list?

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,560
Ooh ooh! I know! Pick me!

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,000
So what do you
do now, Dashie?

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,460
I have to report to
Wonderbolts Headquarters

49
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,900
this afternoon. It's only
two days till tour starts

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
and I need to learn
the routine.

51
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,360
You're leaving already? [gasp]

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,740
But we barely started your
congratulation party!

53
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,320
I haven't even thought about
your going away party yet.

54
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,300
Pinkie, I'm not
leaving Ponyville.

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,250
I just have to
train for this show.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,380
I hope everything
goes well.

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,700
It sounds like an
awful lot of pressure,

58
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,140
having to learn
everything so quickly.

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,330
Yeah, good luck, Dash!

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Luck? [chuckle] Save that
for the rest of the team.

61
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,520
Now that my awesomeness has
finally been recognized,

62
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,640
the other Wonderbolts
will have to keep up

63
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,510
or eat my cloud-trail.

64
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,340
Everypony knows you're a
great flier, Rainbow Dash,

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400
but so are the rest
of the Wonderbolts.

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,450
It might be more
challenging than you think.

67
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,300
[sigh] You're right.

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,520
I mean, do I show up
wearing sunglasses or not?

69
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,960
Sunglasses are
automatically cool,

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,500
but anypony can
put them on. [sigh]

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,020
Maybe I'd stand out
more if I didn't.

72
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,680
Team briefings are
every morning at--

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,660
--oh seven twenty.

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,700
Because there were twenty
ponies in the original

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,600
EUP Guard that became
the Wonderbolts.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,540
Right. And I know you've
seen the Academy bunks,

77
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,040
but these are the official
Wonderbolts' barracks--

78
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,760
--built by Admiral
Fairweather himself!

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,020
[thud]

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,760
Don't forget rule
number one, newbie:

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,580
always check both ways
before crossing the runway.

82
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,140
Uh sure, but nopony
else is here!

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,720
They will be. And most
of the Wonderbolts

84
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,140
like to make a flashy
entrance, so stay alert.

85
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,960
Right. No problem.

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,000
Whoa! Is that
General Flash's cap?

87
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,680
And the original crest with
the Wonderbolts motto on it.

88
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,540
"Altius volantis."
"Soaring higher!"

89
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,400
WOW! [gasp] I mean... cool.

90
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,120
OK, newbie, we've got
a show in two days,

91
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
which means you've gotta
hustle your haunches

92
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,860
to learn this routine.

93
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,600
You've got five minutes to
get dressed and get outside

94
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,000
to meet the rest of the team.

95
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,440
Yes, ma'am! I'll have
all the moves down

96
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,300
by the end of the day.

97
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,440
Let's hope so. We're
all expecting you

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,840
to make quite
an impression.

99
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,980
[whoosh]

100
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,700
Lookin' good! OK, you're about
to take your first flight

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,180
as an actual Wonderbolt.
[sigh] No pressure. [sigh]

102
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,430
Just gotta go out there and
knock 'em off their hooves.

103
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,640
OK, Wonderbolts, get
ready to meet your most

104
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,320
awesome member ever!

105
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,580
[excited chatter]

106
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,540
Hey! Look out!

107
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,080
Huh?

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Whoa!

109
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,617
[crash]

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,180

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,180
Whoa! Most awesome
entrance by a newbie ever!

113
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,280
Are you OK, Rainbow Dash?

114
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,700
More like Rainbow Crash!

115
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,160
[laughter]

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,900
OK, flight school. Get
ready for Rainbow Dash!

117
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,320
Whooooooooa!

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,660

120
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,360
More like Rainbow Crash!

121
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,320
[laughter]

122
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:44,140
Rainbow Crash, Rainbow Crash,
Rainbow Crash, Rainbow Crash!

123
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,360
Hey! You guys buzzed
me on purpose!

124
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,360
Not quite. You forgot
rule number one, newbie.

125
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,760
"Always check both ways
before crossing the runway."

126
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, well, I was just...
testing you guys.

127
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,420
[laughter] Yeah, right.

128
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,900
All right, nopony got hurt
and we've got a lot to do,

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,280
so let's forget about
this and get flying.

130
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,800
Classic rookie move, Rainbow
Crash. That was amazing.

131
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,160
[whoosh]

132
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,400
Higher, Crash! You're
breaking formation!

133
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,620
Check your nine, Crash!

134
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,520
Tighter, Crash! Get in there!

135
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,440
[growl] My name's not Crash!

136
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,220
[grunt] Whoah!

137
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,740
Huh! Coulda fooled me!

138
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,520
Hey Crash, I know it
was a tough day today,

139
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,320
but don't worry, you'll
get the hang of it.

140
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,900
Tough day? Please. If I can
pull off a Sonic Rainboom,

141
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,220
I can learn this routine. I'll
have it down cold tomorrow.

142
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,140
Probably even come up with
a couple of improvements.

143
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,900
Rainbow Dash, over here.

144
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,140
Yes, ma'am?

145
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,620
I'm glad you're
still here.

146
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,860
Oh yeah? Did you want
some ideas on how

147
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,000
to make the show
extra awesome?

148
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,260
Not quite. I know you've
been a Reservist for a while,

149
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,020
but the Bolts have a
few of their own rules

150
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,280
you might not know about.

151
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,000
Like worst flier
of the day

152
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,110
has to clean up the
whole compound.

153
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,940
Better get to it, Crash.

154
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,760
[sigh] My name's not Crash.

Hooray, Rainbow Dash!
Our favorite Wonderbolt!

160

We know you're probably
tired, Rainbow Dash,

161
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,900
but Pinkie wanted to
throw you a real party.

162
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,310
Your Best Day EVER party!

163
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,400
[chuckle] Yeah. It was
something, all right.

164
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,520
Well, we can't wait
to hear all about it.

165

[chuckle] And I'd love to
tell you. I really would.

166
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,680
But I'm pretty beat.
[chuckle] [fake yawn]

167
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,340
You know, from all the
excitement of my big day.

168
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,540
Um, is something
wrong, Rainbow Dash?

169
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,380
What could be wrong? I'm
finally a Wonderbolt,

170
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,080
which means everything has to
be totally perfectly awesome.

171
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,540
Oh no, something is wrong.
What happened, darling?

172
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,540
I told you, it's nothing.

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,180
I mean, maybe some of the
Wonderbolts started calling me

174
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,360
"Rainbow Crash".

175
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,480
Oh no! Isn't that the
same terrible nickname

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,940
those bullies in flight
school used to call you?

177
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,140
Why would they call you that?

178
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,280
Well, I, kinda, sorta
fell into a garbage can.

179
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,100
Ugh!

180
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,340
Well, look at the
bright side!

181
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,280
At least they didn't
call you Rainbow Trash!

182
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,140
So you started off
on the wrong hoof.

183
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,880
I bet every new Wonderbolt
has a tough first day.

184
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,880
Um-hum!

185
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,760
What you need is to find a
positive way to stand out.

186
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,160
As soon as you're known
for something else,

187
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,320
that nasty old nickname
will be forgotten.

188
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,780
Rarity's right.

189
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,120
Why don't you think of the
Wonderbolts like us?

190
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,340
We're a team, but we all stand
out in different ways.

191
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,440
That's it! I'm gonna stand out
in a different way.

192
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,760
Just like you guys!

193
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,660
Goodbye, Rainbow Crash,
hello, Captain Awesome!

194
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,540
Good morning, everypony!

195
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,520
Who's ready for a fantastic day
of flying? I know I am!

196
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,720
I just couldn't be more excited

197
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,220
for the big show tomorrow. Are
you guys excited? I'm excited!

198
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,660
Actually, I'm always excited!

199
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,220
Some ponies even call
me "Dynamic Dash"

200
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,600
because I'm so full of
energy all the time!

201
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,730
Uh, Wonderbolts don't
get excited, Crash.

202
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,240
You gotta keep a level
head to fly the way we do.

203
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,800
[sigh] [Southern accent]
Well, of course I know that!

204
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,380
But the truth of the matter is,
you should be excited.

205
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,020
It's the dream of near every
little Pegasus pony

206
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,520
to grow up and fly
with the Wonderbolts

207
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,040
and here you all are doing it.

208
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,410
So are you.

209
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,260
True. Go ahead and call me
"Forthright Filly"

210
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,690
if you want, but she-ucks, I
like to tell it like it is.

211
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,840
And I believe a pony oughta
appreciate hard work

212
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,500
paying off like this because
being a Wonderbolt

213
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,560
is somethin' special.

214
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,720
<i> We know.</i>

215
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,600
[door closes]

216
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,800
You know, I was just reading
about how dihedral wing angles

217
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,740
can help increase stability
in banking turns.

218
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,620
It made me think that
pre-flight checklists

219
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,460
could really help
increase our efficiency,

220
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,380
so I went ahead and made
them for everypony.

221
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,420
I'm always finding so much
interesting information

222
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,760
in books. In fact, a lot of
ponies call me

223
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,540
"Reading Rainboom."

224
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,420
We all know how
wings work, newbie

225
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,460
and we already have checklists!

226
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,780
Now get off the runway!

227
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,660
[sweet shy voice] I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to help

228
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,980
because I care about all of the
Wonderbolts oh so much.

229
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,120
Yesiree, just call
me "Care Mare."

230
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,640
Um, but if you're busy now, I
can just come back later.

231
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,440
Or, you know, not at all.

232
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,500
OK.

233
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,740
I must tell you how much I
just love these uniforms!

234
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,460
Why, ever since I was a foal,
I've admired the mixture

235
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,720
of bold lines and
classic contours.

236
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,240
They don't call me "Rainbow
Fash" for nothing!

237
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,250
Uh...

238
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,100
The "Fash" is for fashion.

239
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,460
Crash!

240
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm not sure why you're
acting like this,

241
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,760
but you need to stop.

242
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,540
I was just, you know,
trying to show everypony

243
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,360
all the awesome ways I can
contribute to the Bolts.

244
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,600
I know you're excited to find
your place on the team,

245
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,940
but just focus on the
routine for now, OK?

246
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,260
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,100
Maybe this will
help motivate you.

248
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,280
"Crash?"

249
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,980
Couldn't you just put
my regular name on it?

250
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,540
That's not how it
works around here.

251
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,880
We all have our nicknames on our
jackets. Right, Clipper?

252
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,980
Clipper?

253
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Right, boss!

254
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,360
Now it's official. Welcome to
the Wonderbolts, Crash!

255
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,780

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,840
If I don't come up with
something unforgettable

00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,890
to add to the routine,

258
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,120
I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash
for the rest of my life.

I know! I'm almost as
excited as Pinkie Pie!

263

I can't wait to see Rainbow
Dash's first performance

as an honest to

I hope there's
cotton candy!

266
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,600
We should all remember
to be extra supportive

267
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,060
for Rainbow Dash, too.

268
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Excellent point. It's simply
dreadful that she's had

269
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,320
such a rough start after
finally achieving her dream.

270
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,820
Rainbow Dash is a pretty
resilient pony.

271
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,400
I'm sure she's shaken
off her tough first day

272
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,820
and turned it around by now.

273
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,280
Speaking of - hey Dash!

274

Oh, perfect! Hey, can
I borrow Scootaloo?

275
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,460
Me? What for?

276
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,860
Oh, [chuckle] I just
needed some help

277
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,740
and figured the president of
the Rainbow Dash fan club

278
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,880
was the right pony for the job.

279
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,660
I thought the Wonderbolt
Reserves were here to help.

280
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,980
Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing
official Reserves stuff.

281
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,400
But don't worry, with
Scootaloo's help,

282
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,340
everything's gonna be awesome.
Better than awesome.

283
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,440
Does-does that mean practice
went well yesterday?

284
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,680
Gotta go!

285
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,960
What are we doing up here,
Rainbow Dash?

286
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,940
I just need a small
favor from you

287
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,400
that's really gonna make this
show something special.

288
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,820
Now, the Wonderbolts are going
to fly over this ridge

289
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,620
right before the
finale of the show.

290
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,660
I'll fly by last and
when I signal you,

291
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,540
you zip up the ramp
on your scooter

292
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,680
and kick the storm
cloud into my path.

293
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,660
What?

294
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,700
That kick will shoot
off a lightning bolt

295
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,900
right behind me, making
me look totally awesome!

296
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,540
And then I'll do some
incredible Rainbow Dash flying

297
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,520
with it, to create the
coolest, show-stoppingest,

be so awesome!

And no pony will ever call me
"Rainbow Crash" after this.

Oh, gotta go! Be ready for
me, OK, Scootaloo?

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,480
You guys were right to
call me Rainbow Crash.

351
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,780
I've always been
a standout flier,

352
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,600
but since I joined
the Wonderbolts,

353
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,650
I've only stood out
for making mistakes.

354
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
[sigh] It's been my
dream my whole life,

355
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,920
but I guess maybe I'm not
Wonderbolt material after all.

356
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,180
Are you serious?

357
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,730
You're the most talented
flier we've ever had.

358
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,800
And you've saved all of
Equestria like, a dozen times!

359
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,780
I-I--

360
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,660
Of course you're supposed
to be a Wonderbolt!

361
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,380
We've been waiting
for a spot to open up

362
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,060
ever since you
joined the Reserves.

363
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,240
But... you guys... all
called me Rainbow Crash.

364
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,020
Yeah, so? My
nickname's Clipper.

365
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,480
You know why they
call me that?

366
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,980
Uh, cause you're as
fast as a ship?

367
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,340
Because I clipped my
wing on a flagpole

368
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,500
as I was landing on
my first day. Huh.

369
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,260
Huh.

370
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,180
Flatfoot. My first day I
misjudged my landing

371
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,360
and came down right on
Spitfire's hoof.

372
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,960
Daisy.

373
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,960
Slowpoke.

374
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,460
Hoof 'n' Mouth.

375
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,100
You don't want to know
what they call me.

376
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,970
[whispers]

377
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,420
[chuckle] Whoa, that is
so much worse than Crash.

378
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,320
Right?

379
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,400
So, does this mean I'm
still on the team?

380
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,220
You think you can be
part of this team

381
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,080
and not constantly
try to showboat?

382
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,860
I promise. I spent my
whole life trying to be

383
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,100
a standout flier, but now
that I'm a Wonderbolt,

384
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,760
it's time to be OK
with fitting in.

385
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,200
Good. Because I really didn't
want to miss the chance

386
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,940
to tease you for years about
this catastrophe!

387
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,340
I mean, that crash was epic!

388
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,000
[everyone agrees]

389
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,620
But you're on
probation for a month!

390
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,060
Got a problem with that?

391
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,020
No, ma'am.

392
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,300
Hey Rainbow Dash, we just
wanted to check on you.

393
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,580
Are you doing OK?

394
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,260
I'm doing great, thanks!

395
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,900
Sure you don't need any help?

396
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,460
Nah. This mess is my
responsibility

397
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,920
and I've gotta clean it up
myself. And after this,

398
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,260
Spitfire's got me cleaning
the Wonderbolts compound

399
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,100
for the next month.

400
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,960
So why are you in
such a good mood?

401
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,700
Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!
