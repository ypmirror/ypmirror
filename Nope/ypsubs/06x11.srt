1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,620
We're so happy you
could come have lunch

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,660
with your father
and me, Fluttershy.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,560
I'm so glad you asked.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,040
And it was super awesome
of you to invite me too.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,640
Things have been so busy
with the Wonderbolts lately;

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,740
it's great to get a chance
to relax someplace quiet.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,960
That's exactly what I intend
to do now that I've retired.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,960
In fact, I converted
the back house

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,660
to showcase my
cloud collection.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,200
I have my clouds; your
mom has her flowers;

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,600
you've got your animals
and your brother...

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,100
Zephyr Breeze has
his... interests.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,980
I'll say. Remember when he
was convinced square clouds

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,700
were gonna be the next
big thing?

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,240
He's matured a
lot since then.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,200
Actually, it's funny
you bring Zephyr up.

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,700
Oh, no! Not again.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,460
It's just for a
little while, dear.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
Till he gets back
on his hooves.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,360
Wait. You don't mean?

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,200
Guess who's home?

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,660
That's right, big sis,
it's your one and only,

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,660
favorite little
brother... moi!

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,980
Awww.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,360
Hi, Flutter-butter!

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,580
How's the bestest
big sister ever?

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,200
Hey, where's the love?

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,540
How about a little excitement
to see your baby brother?

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,980
I'm just surprised.

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,220
When you left, you said mane
therapy was your calling.

32
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,560
Oh, it is, sis. It is. You would
not believe how much stress

33
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,380
ponies hold in
their manes.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,130
Everything gets limp
and unmanageable.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,020
No offense, but brushing alone
won't solve the problem.

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,560
What went wrong?

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
Nothing went wrong
per se.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,820
It's just "the powers that
be" were so locked into their

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,620
"required styles"
and you know me.

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
I've got my own style
and I think they were

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,860
a little threatened.

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,650
Oh, this is lovely, dear.

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,060
Ugh.

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,400
Well, if it isn't Rainbows "the
best flier that ever was" Dash.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,760
Oh, this ought be good.

46
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,100
Sorry, I shouldn't
tease ya.

47
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,260
I know the whole "super awesome
flyer" bit's just to impress me.

48
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,360
Still, thanks for showing up for
my homecoming, it's, it's sweet.

49
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,400
I kinda thought there'd
be more ponies here.

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,120
I mean, what about your party
planner friend? Sprinkle Pie?

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,940
She coulda turned this into a
real house par-tay, am I right?

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,900
I mean, this place
could use it.

53
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
<i> ♪ Dra-ahb! ♪</i>

54
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,980
I, I ...

55
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,240
We have been meaning
to redecorate.

56
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,800
Dad, please, when I get all my
stuff back in here, you won't

57
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,260
even remember what this
boring old place looked like.

58
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,220
Um, Mom, Dad? Can I talk
to you for a second?

59
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,400
What is it, honey?

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,780
I'm not so sure letting Zephyr
move back home is a good idea.

61
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,320
I know you both
want to help,

62
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,200
but don't you
remember last time?

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,440
Zephyr's just trying to
find his place, dear.

64
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,200
I know. It just seems like
his place always ends up

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,430
being your place.

66
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,180
And then he sort of makes
you do everything for him.

67
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,680
Well, we may not be as
bold as you, Fluttershy,

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,040
but don't you worry. We know
how to stand up for ourselves.

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,760
And they were all like, "We
love your free spirit, Zeph

70
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,000
and it would be wrong to cage
that. Go follow your dreams."

71
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,700
Zeph was just telling me
all about the ins and outs

72
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,660
of Mane Therapy School.

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,430
It's all so political. I
just could not take it.

74
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,120
Well, maybe if you stuck with
it for more than a few weeks?

75
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,840
Sorry, sis, but when
something's not the right fit,

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
this pony's gotta fly!

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
Anyway, good talk, Rainbows.

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,720
I am so touched you
came to see me, really,

79
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,700
I hate to deprive
you of my presence,

80
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,920
but this Breeze needs his Zs.

81
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,900
You know it's the middle
of the day, right?

82
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I know. SIESTA!

83
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,420
I'm just gonna assume
you made up my room

84
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,660
the way I like
it, right, Mom?

85
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,420
Ooh, I almost forgot. All
my stuff is out front.

86
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,720
Wanna grab that for
me, Pops? Thanks!

87
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,600
Same old "Zeph."

88
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,560
I know you weren't expecting
to see your brother,

89
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,880
but you've been kinda
quiet. Even for you.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm sorry, but I am just
so... so peeved right now!

91
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,060
Excuse my language.

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,120
Rainbow Dash! Fluttershy! It's
me, Pinkie Pie! Your friend!

93
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,600
Oh, um, sorry about that.

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,060
We just had lunch with
Fluttershy's parents

95
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,340
and you'll never
guess who showed up.

96
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,060
Ooh, Mayor Mare? Cranky Doodle
Donkey? Cheese Sandwich?

97
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,260
Miss Harshwhinny?

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
Zephyr Breeze.

99
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,180
Oh, that makes more sense.

100
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,860
And from the look
on your face,

101
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,980
I'm guessing it's for another
one of his 'extended' stays.

102
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
She's a bit peeved.

103
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,160
Zephyr is my brother
and I love him,

104
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,700
but he's never learned to
do anything for himself

105
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,820
and I don't know why my
parents keep letting him

106
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,100
trot all over them.

107
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,700
Well, if your parents won't
stand up for themselves,

108
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,920
maybe you need to
stand up for them.

109
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,580
You know, you're right.

110
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,990
Zephyr Breeze!

111
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,400
Oh, hey sis! Come to see me work
my magic and turn this place

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,580
from drab to fab, huh?
Well, watch and learn!

113
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,020
Can't you see what
you're doing?

114
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,040
Yeah, I'm getting
rid of this old stuff

115
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,680
so I can turn the back
house into my art studio.

116
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,560
I've decided I'm going
to be a sculptor!

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm talking about
Mom's flowers.

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,660
She's gonna move them so I can
have my meditation patio here.

119
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,420
She loves replanting
stuff, don't you, Mom?

120
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,060
And Dad's been collecting
his favorite bits of cloud

121
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,480
from the factory since
before you were born.

122
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,260
The very best from
every production run

123
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,030
since my first day
on the job.

124
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,120
But why hold onto
the past, really?

125
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,940
You can't just fly in
and change everything

126
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,480
Mom and Dad have
built here.

127
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,520
But this is the only
place big enough

128
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,860
for my studio/meditation
garden.

129
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,980
Ooh, unless I do it
in the living room!

130
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,490
I know speaking up for yourself
can be hard, believe me.

131
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,920
But Zephyr will never stand on
his own if he can lean on you.

132
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
Don't be so
dramatic, sis.

133
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,480
Mom and Dad just want
to let me be me, right?

134
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,840
I can do plenty on my own.

135
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,900
I agree. Which is why
you should move out.

136
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,280
Oh. Well, I mean,
I totally would.

137
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,680
But I don't think that's
what Mom and Dad want.

138
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,380
It's not, is it?

139
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,420
Uh...

140
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,560
You know we love you, son.
But your sister has a point.

141
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,840
Sure. I mean, I really
just came back here to keep

142
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,200
you guys company. But
whatever's best for the family.

143
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,320
I just...I just gotta
grab a few essentials.

144
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,660
And you definitely have
somewhere else to go?

145
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,620
Of course! There's plenty
of ponies who'd love

146
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,860
for a little Breeze
to blow their way.

147
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,140
So, where's Zeph
gonna go now?

148
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,620
I'm not sure. Oh, I hope
I did the right thing.

149
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,380
Are you kidding?
One hundred percent!

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,580
Hey sis, your new
roomie's here!

151
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,580
OK, maybe like
seventy percent.

152
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,950
Um, Zephyr?

153
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,480
When Mom and Dad told you to
find someplace else to live,

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,160
I don't think
they meant here.

155
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
Well, it's not
their house,

156
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,360
so by definition
it's someplace else.

157
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,800
Am I right, Rainbows? Stop
oogling me and help settle this.

158
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,800
You know what? I totally
forgot that I promised

159
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,700
to help Pinkie Pie...
sprinkle... something.

160
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,720
You said you had
plenty of places to go.

161
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,440
Fine! You can stay here--

162
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,280
You're the best! We're
gonna have so much fun--

163
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,320
--on one condition.

164
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,990
Totally. Anything.

165
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,800
You have to get a job.

166
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,040
Crackin' the whip, huh? You
always were kinda bossy.

167
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,620
Zephyr Breeze!

168
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,220
Kidding! Get a
job. Absolutely.

169
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,980
Where are
we going so early?

170
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,640
You have no idea how bad
morning sun is for your mane.

171
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,820
Remember how we talked
about you getting a job?

172
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,960
It was just yesterday. And
it's totally on my to-do list.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,960
But you can't expect
me to find something

174
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,480
befitting my
awesomeness overnight.

175
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,180
I thought you might
say that.

176
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,200
So I did it for you.

177
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,400
What?

178
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,120
These fabrics all need
to be dyed those colors.

179
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,560
Do you think you
can handle that?

180
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,280
Um...I don't know.

181
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,420
You get started while
Fluttershy and I

182
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,140
head to the store
for more supplies.

183
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,160
Ta-ta!

184
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Good luck!

185
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,090
Thanks for giving
my brother a job.

186
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,290
I just hope he's
up to the task.

187
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,320
Oh darling, dyeing fabric
is the simplest thing.

188
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,740
You just dip cloth
in a bowl.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,040
Rarity! You're back!

190
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,220
What did you do?

191
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,160
Since you talk to
animals all the time,

192
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,620
I just figured it
runs in the family,

193
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,580
so why not outsource
this stuff, you know?

194
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,680
Turns out the animal
communication thing

195
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,540
isn't genetic.

196
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,995
Zephyr! I asked
you to do this job,

197
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,840
not to pawn it off on
innocent woodland creatures.

198
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,640
OK. I guess you have some
feelings about this,

199
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,160
but you should know it's
basically your cat's fault

200
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,270
for walking by and
giving me the idea.

201
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,580
But I'm actually
kinda into this look.

202
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,620
So, I guess what I'm saying
is... you're welcome.

203
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,120
Wha-- Oh, uggh.

204
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,260
Zephyr, this is
just unacceptable!

205
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,460
Wow. I guess I know when my
efforts aren't appreciated!

206
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,940
Whoa, those are tall.

207
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,500
I'm glad you noticed because
they're your new job.

208
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,340
Wha-?

209
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,470
You said you were taking me
to tea with the princess.

210
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,160
Actually, I said I was going
to tea with the princess.

211
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,740
You're going to work.

212
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,680
Sis, c'mon!

213
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,900
Don't worry, Zephyr.
It'll be easy.

214
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,540
I just need a Pegasus pony to
fly up and wipe each window down

215
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,700
from top to bottom.

216
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,840
And I'm here to make
sure you do it right!

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,540
Wow, Zephyr, this
looks amazing!

218
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,120
Well, you know, like
you said, it was easy.

219
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
Where's Spike?

220
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,940
<i> Up here!</i>

221
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,840
You were supposed to supervise,
not do all the work.

222
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,960
I was supervising! And
then Zephyr asked me about

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,080
different cleaning techniques
and which one was best

224
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,880
and if I could--

225
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,080
Hey! I did all
the work.

226
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,940
Don't let him fool you, ol'
Spike is quite the taskmaster.

227
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,460
Oh, come on, sis.

228
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,400
I had to ask Spike to make
sure I was doing it right.

229
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,700
You didn't do it at all!

230
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,240
Well, I guarantee there
won't be any fooling around

231
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,640
on the next job.

232
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,540
Next job?

233
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,480
That's right, Zeph.
You're coming with me.

234
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,640
You don't have to come
up with some excuse

235
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,300
to hang out with
me, Rainbows.

236
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,600
Let's just go for a fly and
see where the day takes us.

237
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,320
Ugh, we're going to
Wonderbolts' Headquarters

238
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,400
and I am going to give you a job
so simple and straightforward,

239
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,340
not even you can weasel
your way out of it.

240
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,460
And the second you try,

241
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,460
I'm going to zap you with
a storm cloud. Got it?

242
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,340
Oh, I got it. I can already feel
the electricity between us.

243
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,050
Rainbow
Dash is crazy, OK?

244
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,060
She expects me to do stuff right
when she asks me to do it!

245
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,050
It's insane!

246
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,460
So you just quit? Again?

247
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,640
Escaped is more like it.

248
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,260
Besides, what was
I supposed to do?

249
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,230
Keep trying? Finish
something for once?

250
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,600
Maybe that way, you'd actually
find something you like to do.

251
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,340
That all sounds fine for your
friends, but it's just not me.

252
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,580
Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I
don't think you can live here.

253
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,620
Fine. I'll just go
live in the woods

254
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,260
like my foreponies before me.

255
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,920
Guess the only breeze this
Zephyr can count on is his own.

256
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,820
Aww cheer up, Fluttershy.

257
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,920
I know it was hard, but
you did the right thing.

258
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,780
You couldn't let Zephyr
pull the same stuff on you

259
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,410
that he's always
pulled on your folks.

260
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
I guess so.

261
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,820
Oh, hello Constance.

262
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,460
Oh? Oh, dear.

263
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,240
See, Wigford, The Breeze needs
nopony. We've got food...

264
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,480
Shelter...

265
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,320
Just need to put
the ol' kettle on.

266
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,440
Come on, stickie-stickie
make with the sparks.

267
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,920
Ugh! What's a pony gotta do to
find a decent stick around here?

268
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,180
I know he needs to learn to
do things for himself, but...

269
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,160
I can't let him
live like this.

270
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,520
Actually, I don't think he'd
make it through the night.

271
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,500
Fluttershy! Hey! I was just, um,
cozying up in my sleeping bag.

272
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,640
Ready to call it
an early night.

273
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,540
Such an exhausting
day, you know?

274
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,260
It's noon.

275
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,940
You know me: siesta!

276
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,080
UGH! I can't do this.
I can't do anything.

277
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,440
Zephyr, you're
smart and talented.

278
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,300
You could do anything
if you just tried.

279
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,180
And what if I give everything
I have and still fail?

280
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,960
Honestly, I think it's
better not to try at all.

281
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,740
But then you won't
ever do anything.

282
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,640
I don't expect you
two to understand.

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
I mean, when have
you ever failed?

284
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,180
You've literally helped save
Equestria, like, a dozen times.

285
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,550
And I was worried that
I'd fail every time.

286
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,460
Sometimes you have to do things
even though you might fail.

287
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,440
But failing is the worst!

288
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,760
And quitting doesn't feel
much better, does it?
No.

289
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,720
So here's the deal: You
can come back with me,

290
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,200
but you have to do exactly
what I say, no exceptions.

291
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,820
I will literally do
anything you ask me

292
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,440
if it means I don't
have to stay here.

293
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,480
OK, you know what you
have to do, right?

294
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,240
Beg for help, then quit
when I get frustrated.

295
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Just kidding. Total
opposite of that. Got it.

296
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,480

326
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,560
I did it. I actually finished
something. By myself.

327
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,940
And it looks exactly
like it's supposed to.

328
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,220
I knew you could do
it, Zephyr.

329
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,140
I didn't!

330
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,100
But I do now. Thanks, for
believing in me, sis.

331
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,300
That's what big
sisters are for.

332
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,300
So, Zeph, now that you've
accomplished this, what's next?

333
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,520
Anything I want! I mean,
the sky's the limit, right?

334
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,640
But, you know, I've got
some baby steps in mind.

335
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,040
Thanks for dinner, Mr. and Mrs.
Shy. It was great, as usual.

336
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,600
Thank you, dear, for
not giving up on Zephyr.

337
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
After all these years
of pining for him,

338
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,900
it must be so satisfying to
see him on the right track.

339
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,600
Have you heard from
Zephyr? Is he doing well?

340
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,140
I tell you, he's
a brand new pony.

341
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,570
So full of drive
and determination.

342
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
That's great.

343
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,860
Guess who graduated from
mane therapy training?

344
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
Awesome!

345
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,300
Congratulations, son.

346
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,300
You look so handsome!

347
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,620
I'm so proud of
you, Zephyr.

348
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,440
It was only a
matter of time

349
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,100
before they recognized
my true genius.

350
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,340
But actually doing the
work probably helped.

351
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,560
And I wouldn't have
if it weren't for you.

352
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Oh I just gave you
some encouragement;

353
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,680
you did this on your own.

354
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,120
And honestly, right now I
feel like I can do anything.

355
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,000
Except find a place.

356
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,000
I can still crash here
for a few days, right?
