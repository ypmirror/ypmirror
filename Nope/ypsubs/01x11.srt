1
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:12,595
Spike! Wake up! Wake up, wake up,
it's Winter Wrap Up Day!

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,555
-Mommy...?
-Winter Wrap Up!

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,353
You're not mommy!

4
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:21,584
Spike! The first day of spring is tomorrow!

5
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:25,672
So everypony in Ponyville needs to clean up
winter. Now help me get ready.

6
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,832
Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter?

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,467
Don't they just use magic to change
the seasons like we do in Canterlot?

8
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:37,020
No, Spike. Ponyville was
started by earth ponies...

9
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:40,347
...so for hundreds of years they've
never used magic to clean up winter.

10
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,203
It's traditional!

11
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,196
It's ridiculous!

12
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:48,071
No magic, pfuh...

13
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:55,220
Okay, let's see. Scarf: Check.
Saddle: Check. Boots: Check.

14
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,035
Spike refusing to get up and
going back to sleep: Check.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,434
It's a good thing I'm so organized.
I'm ready! Bright and early!

16
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:08,287
Oh... Maybe a little too early.

17
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:50,114
Those must be the team vests Rarity designed.

18
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,650
Blue for the weather team...

19
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:53,029
...green for the plant team...

20
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:54,693
...and tan for the animal team.

21
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,962
I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,650
I'll take a blue vest.
The same color as my blanket.

23
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,960
Which I think I hear calling my name.

24
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:06,676
"Spike! Spike! Come to bed!"

25
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,596
Ugh... It's too early.

26
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,022
Thank you, everypony, for being
here bright and early.

27
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:18,135
We need every single pony's help to
wrap up winter and bring in spring.

28
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:24,142
Now, all of you have your vests and
have been assigned to your teams...

29
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:29,596
...so let's do even better than last year and
have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!

30
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:34,663
Oh, this is so exciting!

31
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:37,440
All right, everypony, find your team leader...

32
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,551
...and let's get galloping!

33
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,099
Oh gosh! Where should I go?

34
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:46,074
I'm not sure where I'd fit in.

35
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,817
What exactly does everypony do?

36
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:56,470
<i>Three months of winter coolness
and awesome holidays.</i>

37
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:01,502
<i>We've kept our hoofsies warm at home,
time off from work to play.</i>

38
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:06,561
<i>But the food we've stored is runnin' out
and we can't grow in this cold.</i>

39
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,325
<i>And even though I love my boots,
this fashion's getting old.</i>

40
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,904
<i>The time has come to welcome spring
and all things warm and green,</i>

41
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:21,443
<i>But it's also time to say goodbye,
it's winter we must clean.</i>

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,808
<i>How can I help? I'm new, you'll see.
What does everypony do?</i>

43
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:31,549
<i>How do I fit in without magic?
I haven't got a clue.</i>

44
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,229
<i>Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!

<i>Cause tomorrow spring is here!</i>

47
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:46,469
<i>Bringing home the southern birds,
a pegasus job begins.</i>

48
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:50,893
<i>And clearing all the gloomy skies
to let the sunshine in.</i>

49
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:54,981
<i>We move the clouds
and we melt the white snow.</i>

50
00:03:55,081 --> 00:04:00,121
<i>When the sun comes up,
its warmth and beauty will glow!</i>

<i>Little critters hibernate
under the snow and ice.</i>

56
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:24,005
<i>We wake up all their sleepy heads
so quietly and nice.</i>

57
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:28,126
<i>We help them gather up their food,
fix their homes below.</i>

58
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:33,507
<i>We welcome back the southern birds,
so their families can grow!</i>

<i>With proper care and sunshine,
everyone it feeds.</i>

65
00:04:57,195 --> 00:05:00,987
<i>Apples, carrots, celery stalks,
colorful flowers too.</i>

66
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:05,414
<i>We must work so very hard.

80
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:13,420
What should I do? Where should I go?

81
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,999
All right, team! You're cleared for takeoff!

82
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,047
-Rainbow Dash!
-Oh, hey Twilight! What's up?

83
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,443
What are you doing?

84
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:26,071
Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve
the birds that have flown south for the winter.

85
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,740
Oh! Can I help?

86
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:29,595
How about if I help clear out the clouds?

87
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,091
Um...

88
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:33,452
Right. No wings.

89
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,257
Sorry, Twilight.

90
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:40,118
Great! Now what do we do?

91
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:44,538
I don't know about you but I'm gonna be napping.

92
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,593
Come on, Spike! This is serious business!

93
00:06:48,594 --> 00:06:52,372
Winter needs to be wrapped up.
And I'm determined to do my part!

94
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,730
Somehow.

95
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,655
Rarity, please tell me there's something...
anything I can help you with!

96
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:10,247
Well, how would you like to help create
Ponyville's finest birds' nests?

97
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:11,850
Birds' nests?

98
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:15,632
Why, yes! When the weather team guides
the birds back north for the spring...

99
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,199
...they'll need a place
to live and lay their eggs.

100
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:21,346
Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful!

101
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:25,514
Oh, why, thank you most sincerely.
Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?

102
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,534
Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?

103
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:34,340
Okay now. Uh... Take some of that straw and
hay over there and a little bit of branch.

104
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:38,168
Now weave them through there... Yes!

105
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:42,182
Uh... Take some ribbon, yes... oh uh n...
not there... oohhh... yes...

106
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,057
Tuck it in over there. Uh...
but be careful not to...

107
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:48,855
Oh no no, I... I guess that will do... Oh dear.

108
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,413
There!

109
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:55,020
It looks just like... yours. Oh my.

110
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:56,964
That nest needs to be condemned!

111
00:07:56,965 --> 00:08:00,924
Oh, Spike. It's not so bad.

112
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,221
Maybe the birds can use it as a...

113
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:04,622
An outhouse?

114
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:09,221
Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little
rough aroung the edges.

115
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:10,703
Let me lend you a hoof.

116
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:15,149
Let's just untie this ribbon and if we take
out these sticks here, we'll shape this...

117
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:19,137
I think we lost her.

118
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,661
...and we need to weave the string in here...

119
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:25,262
Hellooo, Twilight!

120
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:28,955
Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite a skater.

121
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:31,356
Probably the best skater I've ever seen.

122
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,706
Thanks, Twilight! I've been doing this since I
was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie!

123
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,663
This comes naturally.

124
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,795
Which is probably why they
designated me the lake scorer.

125
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,746
I cut lines in the lake with my skates.

126
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:48,461
That way, when the rest of the weather
team comes here to break the ice...

127
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,561
...it will be easy as pie!

128
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:55,020
How clever! When the thick ice begins
to melt, it will break along the lines.

129
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:59,115
Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you.
There's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.

130
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,690
Huh... Tell me about it!

131
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,854
Hey, Twilight! Wanna help me out?

132
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:04,488
Would I?

133
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:08,266
Come on, put on those skates over there.
I bet you'll be a natural too!

134
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:09,491
Okay.

135
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,505
Maybe on second thought...

136
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:18,414
What are you talking about?
You said you wanted to be helpful.

137
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:20,985
Now get out there!

138
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:27,042
Twilight! Steer! Steer!

139
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,780
Oh boy!

140
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:44,365
You ARE a natural, Twilight! Natural disaster!

141
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:49,461
Twilight, you did a great
job your first time around.

142
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:54,155
I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly
and bobbling and crasherrific as yours.

143
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,569
Really?

144
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,387
...No.

145
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,058
But did I make you feel better?

146
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:02,233
Yeah... I guess.

147
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,847
I bet you'll be super awesome at something
that keeps your hooves on the ground.

148
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,421
I know! Fluttershy could probably
use your help with the critters.

149
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:11,786
Well, I'm pretty good with little animals.

150
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:14,005
Yeah! I'll go help her!

151
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:17,215
It's... that way.

152
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,951
Wake up, little sleepy heads!

153
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:29,787
Hope you had some wonderful
dreams and restful hibernation.

154
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:33,243
But it's time to up now! Spring is coming!

155
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:39,520
Awww, how cute!

156
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,154
Aren't they? This is my
favorite task the whole season.

157
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:46,135
When I get to see all my
little animal friends again.

158
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:48,483
Uh... what's "hibernation"?

159
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:51,295
It's like a long sleep.

160
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,108
Long sleep?

161
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:54,458
Yes.

162
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,667
Wake up, little porcupines!

163
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:03,166
Animals often hibernate through the winter
to save their energy and eat less food.

164
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:08,040
I definitely like the idea of hibernation.
Uh... except for the "eat less food" part.

165
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:18,012
Oh, but just look at all these warrens and dens.

166
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:22,131
I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up
every animal before spring comes.

167
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:24,967
Well, I'll help, Fluttershy!

168
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,966
Oh, you will? Oh, that would be wonderful!

169
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,684
Okay!

170
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,713
Let's start there!

171
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,351
Hello! Wake up, little friends!

172
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:42,301
Wherever you are. Spring is coming!

173
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:47,760
I wonder which cute little
furry creatures I've awoken!

174
00:11:50,264 --> 00:11:52,978
Aaa! Snakes! Snaaakes!

175
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,325
Good morning, friends!

176
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:14,405
All this Winter Wrap Up stuff
is a lot harder than it looks.

177
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,860
Right. Because there's no magic.

178
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,000
Why don't you just use magic,
Twilight, and get it done the right way?

179
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:23,236
No, Spike. I have to do it the traditional way.

180
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:26,027
Ponyville has never needed
magic to wrap up winter.

181
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:28,795
But they never had you here before, either.

182
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:31,626
Think of how much quicker they could
wrap up winter with your magic!

183
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:37,377
No, no, NO! I'm gonna find some other
way that I can help out if it kills me!

184
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:42,783
Keep pushin', Caramel! That's it, Bumpkin!

185
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:46,766
I know it's hard work, but you
guys are doin' great! YEEHAW!

186
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,164
Hey, Applejack! How's everything going?

187
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:53,272
Oh, just dandy. A little slow startin'
but peachy all the same.

188
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,319
There's a lotta groung to clear, ya hear?

189
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,136
We can't ever start the
plantin' and the waterin'...

190
00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:59,460
...until we get all these heap
o' snow hightailed outta here.

191
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,705
Well, I'd like to help.

192
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,590
Well... I... I don't know, Twilight.

193
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,243
Just give me a chance!

194
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,726
Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...

195
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:27,240
"Think of how much quicker they could
wrap up winter with your magic!"

196
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:31,658
I could use a come-to-life spell...

197
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,986
Here goes.

198
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:53,804
She's awful strong for such a little pony.

199
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:00,894
That's my girl! Following my advice.

200
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,279
And what in tarnation does that mean?

201
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,356
Slow down! SLOW DOWN!

202
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:28,678
What's goin' on?

203
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,826
What'd you do?

204
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,378
You used magic, didn't you?!

205
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:55,516
Nuts, Twilight! You used magic!

206
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:58,126
The nerve, can you believe her?

207
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:02,224
That's not how we do it round here, Twilight.

208
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:04,759
And especially not on my farm!

209
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:08,222
Well, see... I just wanted to...

210
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,861
Oh!

211
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,731
Come on, Twilight. Come on out!

212
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,224
I'm a winter mess up.

213
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,210
Oh, you're good at a lot of things.

214
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:33,844
Just not nest making, ice skating,
animal waking, snow clearing...

215
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:38,080
Huh, thanks a lot for making
me feel sooo much better.

216
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,307
That's what I'm here for, sister.

217
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:43,769
Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team
need to melt the rest of this snow here...

218
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,036
...on the ground and the trees pronto.

219
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:46,919
Got it!

220
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,893
You can't! My poor little animals' homes
will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.

221
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:52,709
Got it.

222
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,147
I'm tellin' you, Rainbow.
You gotta melt that snow now!

223
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,690
No! You simply must wait!

224
00:15:58,878 --> 00:15:59,998
Okay...

225
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,612
-Go.
-Stop.

226
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,082
-Go!
-Stop!

227
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,184
-GO!
-STOP!

228
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,964
Urgh! Make up your minds!

229
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,112
Oh! What in Equestria are
all you arguing about?

230
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:15,354
This sort of sillyness is why we
were late for spring last year.

231
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:18,129
And the year before that.
And the year before that!

232
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,950
Did she say late?

233
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:25,122
I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech
would urge everyone to do better than last year.

234
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:28,327
But now it looks like we're
going to be later than ever!

235
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,459
I mean just look at this catastrophe.

236
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,381
The ice scorers made the ice
chunks too big to melt.

237
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,339
The nest designer's horrendously behind.

238
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,311
We need several hundred
and she's only made one.

239
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:44,284
And don't get me started on all the clouds still
in the sky, the icicles on the trees...

240
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:47,923
Oh, this isn't good. Not at all!

241
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:52,076
And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous
if we can't get our seeds all planted.

242
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,986
Chillax, Applejack. We're busting
our chops as fast as we can.

243
00:16:55,987 --> 00:17:00,503
No, not fast! You have to wake animals slowly.

244
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,530
Uh, AJ?

245
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:06,568
Oh, good gravy! Caramel lost the
grass seeds again, didn't he?

246
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,258
Ey-yup.

247
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:13,288
Ditzy-Doo accidentally went north
to get the southern birds!

248
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,512
Oh, that featherbrain! Didn't she learn
her lesson last year, when she went west?

249
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:25,034
Stop this at once! We don't have time to argue!

250
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:28,612
It's almost sundown.
Spring is going to be late again.

251
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,322
Another year of scandal and shame!

252
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:34,398
If only we could be more organized...

253
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,092
Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard.

254
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:39,193
-Stat!
-Eh... Yes, m'am.

255
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:41,324
Stop everypony!

256
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:44,046
Stop!

257
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:49,755
Sorry.

258
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:52,950
I know you all want to
complete your jobs on time.

259
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:56,569
But arguing is no way to go about it!
What you need is...

260
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:59,080
Organization!

261
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:01,327
And I'm just the pony for the job.

262
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:18,289
I can't believe it. Spring is here! On time!

263
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,416
And we have you to thank for it.

264
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:24,051
If it weren't for your organizing
skills, we would still be arguing.

265
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:25,172
Ey-yup.

266
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,756
It was a team effort.

267
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:33,848
And since you helped every team,
we have an official vest for you.

268
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:38,176
We give you the title "All-Team Organizer"!

269
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:41,415
Gosh... I don't even know what to say.

270
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,078
Thank you, everypony!

271
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:46,701
And hereby I declare that winter is...

272
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:49,176
...wrapped up on time!

273
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:56,256
Spike sure gonna be in for a hog-sized
surprise when that last piece a' ice melts.

274
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,863
"Dear Princess Celestia."

275
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:07,516
"Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special
things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville."

276
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:12,466
"It helped me to learn that we all have hidden
talents and if we're patient and diligent..."

277
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,188
"...we're sure to find them."

278
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:18,852
"And as always, with good friendship and
teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything."

279
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:20,342
How's that, Spike?

280
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:21,921
Spike?

281
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,884
Oh, Spike...

282
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:33,921
