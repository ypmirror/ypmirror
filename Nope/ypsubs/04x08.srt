1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,439
<i>There you are, Rarity.</i>

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,055
That's the last of your bags.

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:12,187
Actually Spike, I've got one
last pile of bags over there.

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,149
Won't you be a dear?

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,186
Sure. I'll be a dear.

6
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:25,728
An entire week in the
fabulous city of Manehattan,

7
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:29,059
plus all of my very best
friends there with me!

8
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:30,813
Of course, we'd
all come along

9
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,682
to support you during
Fashion Week, Rarity.

10
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:33,994
Not that you'll
need it.

11
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,467
We're sure
you'll win.

12
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,392
Ooh, I can't begin to
tell you how excited I am

13
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:42,310
that you'll all
be there with me. However,

14
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:45,194
perhaps
I can show you...

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,446
What's that?

16
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:50,360
Oh, oh, oh, I know!
A paper fan!

17
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:51,592
No.

18
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,661
a magic trick!

19
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:55,166
You know, where I pick a card
and remember what it is

20
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:57,047
and then put it back in the deck
so you can't look at it and--

21
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:01,239
These are tickets to the
hottest musical on Bridleway.

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,003
You couldn't mean
Hinny Of The Hills,

23
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:06,462
because that show's been
sold out for months...

24
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,802
or could you?

25
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:09,510
I could. I do.

26
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:11,826
Oh Rarity, you didn't
have to do that.

27
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,492
But since you did...

28
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:17,783
This trip is fun already!

29
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,480
I love jumping up and down!

30
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:20,095
Wheee!

31
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:29,857

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,836
<i>Come along, ponies.</i>

33
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:12,782
I found us a place to stay only
a block from the train station,

34
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,553
in the very heart of
this glorious metropolis!

35
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,161
<i>Hey, look!</i>

36
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,481
There's the theater where
Hinny Of the Hills is playing!

37
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,409
<i>Cool!</i>

38
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:25,685
<i>Wow, Rarity.</i>

39
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:28,173
<i>How'd you manage to get us</i>
<i>seats for tomorrow night?</i>

40
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:30,294
I gave some designs to
the costume designer,

41
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:32,401
so he pulled a few strings.

42
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:33,765
Cool!

43
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,239
That is makes Manehattan
<i>so splendid and amazing.</i>

44
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,520
<i>You do something</i>
<i>nice for somepony,</i>

45
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:42,560
and you never know when they'll
<i>do something nice for you.</i>

46
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:44,839
<i>So then you can</i>
<i>do something nice for us.</i>

47
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,566
Like get us in to see
Hinny Of The Hills.

48
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:51,186
Which is only the best
musical in all of Equestria!

49
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:53,598
It must be good if Rainbow
Dash is impressed.

50
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,089
Normally, she doesn't
even <i> like</i> musicals.

51
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,118
I know.

52
00:02:57,496 --> 00:03:00,107
Ponies just bursting into
song in random places

53
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:02,493
at the drop of a hat.
Who does that?

88
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,528
To think my dresses
could soon be displayed

89
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:30,386
on the most glamorous
shopping thoroughfare

90
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,626
of the most glamorous
city in Equestria.

91
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:36,280
Oh! It would be my
dream come true.

92
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:38,651
Is there anything left to
do we can help you with?

93
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:40,382
Hm. Nothing I can think of.

94
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,464
The dresses are all
completely finished,

95
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,876
all made from a
fabulous new fabric

96
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:46,240
I've been developing
for months.

97
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:50,052
Stretchy but not clingy,
shimmery but not showy.

98
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,040
Sounds amazing.

99
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,753
There's nothing left for me to
do but check in at the runway

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,971
with my dresses by
two this afternoon.

101
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:59,041
That's funny, because
that clock over there

102
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:00,903
makes it seem like that's
only ten minutes from now.

103
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,479
Oh, my ribbons and threads!

104
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,621
And the runway ballroom is
all the way across town.

105
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:12,368
If I don't get there,
I'm disqualified! Taxi!

106
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:15,732
Oh no! We've got to help
her find a cab now!

107
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,143
I'm on it.

108
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,194
Hey buddy, is this cab taken?

109
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:22,070
The line ends
back there, buddy!

110
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,656
Huh? What?

111
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,115
Does everypony in
this town want a cab?

112
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,025
I'm afraid getting a
taxi at this time

113
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:30,119
could prove almost
impossible.

114
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,152
Please, won't you let
her have this taxi?

115
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,837
She has somewhere very
important to be right away.

116
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,148
Not likely!

117
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,464
She can get in line
like the rest of us!

118
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:43,687
Oh, it's no use.

119
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,654
The cab drivers just
drive right past

120
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,227
to get to the next
pony in line.

121
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,557
New wheel works
like a charm.

122
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,986
So now which of you nice
folks are hoppin' in?

123
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:56,735
Fashion Runway Plaza
in seven minutes.

124
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:57,504
Can you make it?

125
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:58,476
Hang on!

126
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,560
Ta ta!

127
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,553
Phew! That was close.

128
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:06,074
Anypony else got a
sneaking suspicion

129
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,873
we're forgetting something?

130
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:09,951
The dresses!!

131
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,154
Good afternoon. I'm
here for Fashion Week.

132
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:20,302
Everypony's gathered in front of
the runway and about to start.

133
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,975
So you'll just have to bring
your dresses along with you

134
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,965
and store them
backstage later.

135
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:28,202
My, my dresses?! How could I
possibly forget them?

136
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:29,943
Ah! Ah! Ah!

137
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,265
I'm doomed!

138
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:33,808
Got 'em right
here, ma'am.

139
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,494
Your friends told me you
need these in a hurry

140
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:37,184
so I offered to race
them over myself.

141
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,045
"Anything for that
nice mare" I told 'em.

142
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,538
<i>You're a life saver!</i>

143
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,677
Whew! I made it!

144
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:46,739
And with seconds to spare.

145
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,916
Hello, everypony!

146
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,295
Pleased to meet you all.

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,948
Rarity, I presume?

148
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:56,922
You must be Prim Hemline,
the host of this grand event.

149
00:07:57,674 --> 00:07:58,240
How do you--

150
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,677
Miss Rarity, how is it
that all your competitors

151
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,294
are here half an hour early,

152
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:04,817
and yet you arrive
seconds before we begin?

153
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,746
Oh, um, heh heh.
Just lucky I guess.

154
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:13,531
Once we're done here, you're
to finish setting up backstage,

155
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:16,152
so you'll be ready for your
run-through appointment.

156
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,323
You'll show your
designs last.

157
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,185
We keep to a precise schedule

158
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:23,030
so let's try to be more than
a few seconds early, hmm?

159
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:25,824
Tomorrow is the contest
to see which one of you

160
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:29,391
gets to stay to meet top
designers all across the city.

161
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,933
The rest of you
must go home early.

162
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,178
So sad.

163
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,551
Dismissed.

164
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,414
I'm so glad you
made it, Rarity.

165
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:43,211
Me too, but everything just
seems to keep working out.

166
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,981
Don't you remember me?

167
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:48,400
Suri Polomare, from the
Ponyville Knitter's League?

168
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:50,909
Oh! Yes of course, of course!

169
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:53,742
I thought you looked familiar
but I couldn't place it.

170
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:55,557
You haven't been
back in years.

171
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:59,851
Because I moved here to make it
in the big city. OK?

172
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,721
Oh! Good for you, Suri!

173
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,817
It's so good to see you.

174
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,741
And now here we are...

175
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,032
Competing.OK.

176
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,224
Yes, yes.

177
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:11,278
Well, good luck.

178
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:12,663
Oh, I don't need luck.

179
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,425
Would you like a hoof
with your things?

180
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:16,530
Why thank you so much.

181
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:20,208
My, your collection is gorgeous!

182
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:23,680
Oh now, I'm sure your
collection is equally lovely

183
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:24,745
if not more so.

184
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,309
It's all right, but
nothing like this!

185
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,262
Take my culottes, for example.

186
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,520
They are simply crying out
for just the right accent

187
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,166
but I haven't the
slightest notion where--

188
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:37,869
Actually, just a touch of this
fabric could be perfect with it.

189
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:41,184
Hey, would you mind terribly
if I took a swatch?

190
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:42,729
Oh, not at all.

191
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:44,571
Here, I have loads extra.

192
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,314
You're sure?

193
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:47,274
Positive.

194
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:49,326
Well, it's been wonderful
getting caught up

195
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,786
and I... I don't wish to be rude,

196
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,320
but I need to finish
my preparations

197
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:54,618
and I am a bit late
as it... is?

198
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,700
Hello, I'm here
half an hour early

199
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:03,678
for my run-through appointment,
just the way Prim likes.

200
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:05,334
Get in line over there.

201
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:10,435
Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous.

202
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,087
Did you make that yourself?

203
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:15,664
Why yes, it's...
stretchy but not clingy.

204
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,884
<i>Shimmery but not showy.</i>

205
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:20,801
<i>And the entire line is in</i>
<i>this same adorable pattern</i>

206
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:23,746
<i>that works on everything from</i>
<i>skirts to tops to shoes.</i>

207
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:27,828
Bravo! I've never seen
anything like it.

208
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,571
You stole my fabric!

209
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:35,479
I didn't steal it,
OK?

210
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,533
You gave it to me, remember?

211
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:39,678
I gave you the
fabric for accents,

212
00:10:39,902 --> 00:10:41,457
not for your whole line!

213
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,203
And how could you possibly
make all those outfits

214
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:44,362
out of it so fast?

215
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:45,994
Fast! Ha!

216
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,858
<i>Coco Pommel here took</i>
<i>practically forever.</i>

217
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,104
<i>Nearly got me</i>
<i>completely disqualified.</i>

218
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:52,844
Well, I wanted to
make sure you'd win,

219
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,173
so I took the
extra time to--

220
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:54,885
Quiet!

221
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:58,392
I pay an assistant to sew and
get coffee, not talk. OK?

222
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:00,597
How could this happen?

223
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:02,829
Aw sweetie, don't
blame yourself.

224
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,574
It takes some small town
fillies a while to learn

225
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,175
it's everypony for herself
in the big city. OK?

226
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,779
Hope you realize how fortunate
you are to have me as a mentor.

227
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,164
Now get me some coffee!

228
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,748
<i>Oh my gosh, what a great afternoon!</i>

229
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,494
<i>That was almost</i>
<i>too much fun.</i>

230
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:25,006
Better pace yourself, 'cause the
rest of the day is jam packed.

231
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:26,667
First, there's the
salon appointment

232
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,095
to get our manes done.

233
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,152
Then our fancy dinner
at the Far Field Tavern.

234
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,159
And after that?

235
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:32,622
Hinny Of The Hills!

236
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,466
Is everything OK?

237
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,183
You got the dresses the
bellhop brought you

238
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:45,375
and everything, right?

239
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,595
But he said he brought them.

240
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:55,752
<i>And then Suri stole them!</i>

241
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:58,341
I let one of the
other contestants

242
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,843
use some of my one-of-a-kind
fabric

243
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,581
and then she turned it into a
wardrobe just like mine,

244
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,957
only now it looks like I'm
the one copying her!

245
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,040
My generosity has
ruined me, I tell you!

246
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,838
Ruined!

247
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,985
Now Rarity, whatever went wrong,

248
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,718
we're all here to help
you get through it.

249
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,275
No matter what it takes.

250
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:22,017
Come on, Rarity, buck up.

251
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:25,100
All we need is some fabric and
you'll be back in business.

252
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,475
This new line is going
to be marvelous!

253
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,110
Perhaps even better
than the last.

254
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:43,055
It's daring! It's bold!

255
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:45,231
Perhaps I still have
a chance after all!

256
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,028
Twilight, sew these
pieces together

257
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:10,398
according to that
pattern there.

258
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,821
You said if we skipped
dinner at the Far Field Tavern,

259
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:15,026
you'd order a meal for us to
eat while we keep working.

260
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:17,190
Don't fret. It will
be here in an hour.

261
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:18,942
That's not going to
be a problem, is it?

262
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,219
Well...

263
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:24,618
we're supposed to be watching
Hinny Of The Hills by then.

264
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,655
Oh. I see.

265
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:29,414
I go out of my way to get
you tickets for a show,

266
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,079
and this is how you repay me?

267
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,352
By abandoning me
in my hour of need?

268
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,885
Fine! Go and see Hinny
Of The Hills tonight.

269
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,225
Then tomorrow morning when you
come to see my fashion show

270
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,543
without any fashion to show, you
can have more entertainment.

271
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:49,767
"Oh, why look, there's our friend
Rarity going down in flames."

272
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,233
"Isn't friendship magic?"

273
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:53,951
Rarity, calm down.

274
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:55,188
What's gotten into you?

275
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:56,528
What's gotten
into YOU?

276
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:59,685
Go ahead, see
your little show.

277
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,910
Congratu-pony-lations,
fillies!

278
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:03,619
Sounds like you've all
figured out already

279
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:06,134
it's every pony for
herself in this town!

280
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,823
There, that's the last of them.

281
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:23,242
Finally.

282
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:25,810
You're welcome.

283
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,124
Let's have another round of
applause for Suri Polomare's

284
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,884
amazing collection.

285
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,481
That fabric! So original!

286
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:45,787
Well, look who's here.

287
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,742
Going to show off your
copycat collection?

288
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:53,627
And now, Rarity from Ponyville
with her brand new line...

289
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,200
and I mean brand
new: Hotel Chic.

290
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:18,544
They're liking it.

291
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:20,368
I think I may have
just won this thing.

292
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:22,398
Oh, I can't wait to
celebrate with...

293
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:26,893
my friends.

294
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:28,222
They didn't come.

295
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,887
What have I done?

296
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:42,259
Rarity, they all adore you!

297
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:45,389
Aren't you going to tell them
about your fabulous pieces?

298
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:51,763
I have to go.

299
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:54,078
Come back at once!

300
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,491
This is unheard of!

301
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:00,542
How do you do, ma'am?

302
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:01,543
Contest going well?

303
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:02,526
No time to talk.

304
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,021
I have to find my friends.

305
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,855
Oh. They're
gone already.

306
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,905
I saw them headed
out this morning.

307
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,813
Oh no!

308
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,911
Back to Ponyville, I imagine.

309
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,802
Oh! They worked so
hard on my behalf

310
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:15,838
and I repaid them
with unkindness.

311
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:17,656
What have I done?

312
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,584
Oh. Here you are.

313
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:24,522
But Miss, I
didn't do anything!

314
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,264
<i>♪ Oh Manehattan,</i>
<i>what have I done? ♪</i>

I need a moment
with Prim Hemline.

321
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,594
I have to rush
back to Ponyville

322
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,094
but I just wanted to
thank her first for--

323
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:26,277
Uh oh oh. You best steer
clear of Prim for a while.

324
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,720
She's pretty furious.
Isn't that right?

325
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,788
Um...yes.

326
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:34,893
There you all are!

327
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:37,237
I can't believe it! I
thought you went back home.

328
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,832
We missed the show
because we overslept.

329
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:43,795
Suri told us you lost;
we're really sorry.

330
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,290
I lost?

331
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:49,151
You know what? I
don't even care.

332
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:52,454
I'm just happy you're all still
here after how I treated you.

333
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,014
Taking advantage of your
friendship the way I did.

334
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:56,981
<i>How could you</i>
<i>ever see past it?</i>

335
00:17:58,115 --> 00:17:59,728
Yeah, you were
pretty rotten.

336
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:01,180
Wow, Applejack.

337
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:04,013
I know your thing is
honesty, but come on!

338
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,436
Last night we may not have
seen you at your best,

339
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,852
but we know you.

340
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:10,899
And we would never let
one thing like that

341
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:12,394
change how we
feel about you.

342
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:15,395
Oh! Thank you.

343
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:17,828
You really are the most
wonderful friends

344
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,453
a pony could have.

345
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:23,285
You know, I already arranged
to make it up to you

346
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:24,374
this afternoon.

347
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:27,358
Hope you're all available
for an exclusive performance

348
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,012
of Hinny Of The Hills.

349
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,047
And that is how it's done.

350
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:38,054
Pretty clever how I convinced
her to stay away from Prim,

351
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:38,680
wasn't it?

352
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:42,517
Wouldn't have wanted her to find
out the truth, now would we?

353
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:54,401
<i>♪ And I'm a dancing pony! </i>

354
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:05,334
Wow, that was even
better than I imagined!

355
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,254
I LOVED IT!

356
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:13,619
Uh, I mean, it was all right.

357
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:18,942
How did you ever get them to
agree to do an extra performance

358
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:19,861
just for us?

359
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:22,548
Remember my costume designer
friend who got me the tickets?

360
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:26,641
Well, I offered to make all
the costumes for his next show.

361
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,844
Um... Here in Manehattan?

362
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,148
Well, um... yes.

363
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:34,821
It will keep me away from
Ponyville for a while...

364
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,555
But I so wanted
you to see this show!

365
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:40,870
And working for this designer
is such a great opportunity.

366
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:41,943
We know.

367
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:43,789
We're happy for you, Rarity.

368
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:45,947
We're just sad for us.

369
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:47,793
<i>Mind if I join you?</i>

370
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:52,089
Sure. Come on down.

371
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,449
This is the First Place
Trophy for Fashion Week.

372
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,051
With my name on it.

373
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,433
But I thought I lost!

374
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:04,267
You didn't. You won.

375
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:08,593
Suri was hoping that if you
didn't claim your prize,

376
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:10,308
the judges would
consider it a forfeit

377
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:12,072
and first place
would go to her.

378
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:16,347
So she lied to make you and
your friends go away, and...

379
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,987
well, I lied, too.

380
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,350
I've worked for
Suri for so long,

381
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,932
I started to believe
that it really is

382
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:25,071
every pony for
herself in this town.

383
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,308
Until I saw how generous
you were with your friends.

384
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,501
And how generous
they were with you.

385
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:32,714
It made me start believing

386
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,973
there was something
better for me out there.

387
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,987
So I, I quit.

388
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:41,303
I brought you something
to say thank you.

389
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:47,326
I suppose you'll need a job now
that you're no longer with Suri.

390
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,012
How would you like to
work for my friend

391
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:53,361
making all the costumes
for his next show?

392
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,469
Manehattan was simply grand.

393
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:02,827
<i>It was in this magnificent</i>
<i>metropolis that I learned</i>

394
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,324
<i>that while there are ponies</i>
<i>who will take advantage</i>

395
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:06,273
<i>of your generosity,</i>

396
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:08,577
<i>you should never, ever</i>
<i>let that cause you</i>

397
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:10,481
<i>to abandon your</i>
<i>generous spirit.</i>

398
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:13,106
<i>Nothing feels worse</i>
<i>than taking advantage</i>

399
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:15,176
<i>of the giving nature</i>
<i>of your friends.</i>
