1
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:06,416
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

2
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:08,966
You've really outdone yourselves,
Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

3
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:13,113
This is sure to be the winning entry
of this year's National Dessert Competition!

4
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,664
Oh, thank you Pinkie!

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,154
And thanks for transporting it
all the way to Canterlot for us.

6
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:20,336
Absolutely! It's my honor and I-

7
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,273
Beg pardon but,
could we maybe move things along?

8
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:26,196
This here cake's a mite heavy,
right Big Macintosh?

9
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,308
Eeyup.

10
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,129
All righty then, Big Mac!

11
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:34,059
To the train depot!

12
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,968
That's it Big Mac, nice and slow.

13
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,964
This is precious cargo you're carrying.

14
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,847
Yes, it took months
of planning and testing.

15
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:45,098
I would hate for it to-

16
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:48,966
Fall!

17
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,946
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

18
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:55,293
Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy,
a little pegassistance?

19
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,909
I'll get it there safely, you'll see!

20
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:04,851
Of course, Pinkie.

21
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:06,502
We never doubted you.

22
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:14,978
Twilight, can I see you a second?

23
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:19,317
A nice protective spell
as extra insurance...

24
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:20,568
Better safe than sorry.

25
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:27,539
AJ, Rarity, one last thing?

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,898
All right everypony,
we're in the home stretch here.

27
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:40,280
See, Mr. and Mrs. Cake?
I got it here without a hitch!

28
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:43,457
Now all we have to do is get it...

29
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,239
in?

30
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:55,291

33
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,907
Thank you all for helping me get
the cake safely on the dessert car.

34
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:37,675
Thank you for inviting us all
to go with you to Canterlot

35
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,567
for the National Dessert Competition.

36
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:42,324
I'm sure the festivities
will be just lovely.

37
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,598
Fooey on the festivities,
I can't wait to try

38
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,284
all those tasty treats!

39
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:50,569
Well, the tastiest treat
of all is sure to be the Cake's

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,685
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

41
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:57,312
All that rich creamy goodness
of the marzipan,

42
00:02:57,463 --> 00:02:59,941
combined with the tart tanginess
of the mascarpone,

43
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:04,998
blended perfectly with the smooth,
silky sweetness of the meringue...

44
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,915
That's why I call the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

45
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,866
the "MMMM".

46
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,725
Exactly.

47
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:17,257
It's the most delicious delectable
delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria.

48
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,800
And it's sure to win first prize.

49
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,490
This is not so.

50
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:23,544
For I, Gustave Le Grand,

51
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:28,262
do challenge your crude cake
to a duel of delectable delacacies

52
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:33,146
against my exceptionally exquisite éclairs!

53
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:37,595
They will undoubtedly strike down
all the competition,

54
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:40,122
winning first prize and crowning me...

55
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:41,773
<i>le champion!</i>

56
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:43,553
Not a chance, Le Grand.

57
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:44,904
Doughnut Joe!

58
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,831
What are you doing in Ponyville?

59
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:51,486
Picking up the final all-important
ingredient for my contest entry...

60
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:54,382
"Doughnutopia"!

61
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,511
And with these super-sprinkles,

62
00:03:56,662 --> 00:04:01,164
my doughnuts are gonna dunk all
the other lousy desserts steal first prize,

63
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,565
and make my doughnut shop famous...

64
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:05,264
forever!

65
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:11,364
Oh, Joe... your dippy doughnuts
could never outrun me.

66
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,254
Hello. What's your name?

67
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:18,203
I am Mulia Mild.

68
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:21,934
Behold, my chocolate mousse moose.

69
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:25,898
It will trample all your treats,
be given first prize,

70
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:30,081
and make me the greatest chef
in Equestria...

71
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:35,301
Madame Mild, you and your
mousse moose are mistaken.

72
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:38,565
Your frou-frou éclairs
will never defeat my doughnuts!

73
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:41,108
The Cakes'
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

74
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:42,419
is going to win!

75
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,409
Your simple cake could never
take my moose.

76
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:56,875
Well, it sure looks like we're in
for a delicious competition tomorrow.

77
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:59,585
Maybe we should all settle in
for a good night's sleep.

78
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,657
I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.

79
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:15,288
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.

80
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,367
Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs?

81
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,442
We have to protect "MMMM".

82
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:21,993
Mmmm?

83
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:23,344
Mmm hmm.

84
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:26,936
I know for super sure that "MMMM"
is the best dessert in all of Equestria.

85
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:28,613
And I know that they know it too.

86
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:29,864
So...

87
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:33,546
So... one of them is going to
sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight!

88
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:35,420
You have to help me stand guard!

89
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,816
Pinkie, you're overreacting.

90
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,334
Yeah, those chefs aren't gonna
do your cake any harm.

91
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:42,779
But they are! I just know it.

92
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,391
Fine!
If you wanna stand guard, go for it.

93
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:46,942
We're going to bed.

94
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,007
I'll show them.

95
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:57,935
I'll stay up all night and protect you.

96
00:05:58,086 --> 00:06:02,080
Nothing and nopony will stop me
from keeping you safe.

97
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,131
Stop, you saboteur!

98
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:27,585
I have you now!

99
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:55,205
Thank Celestia, you're okay!

100
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:58,165
But one of those bakers
is mixing up something bad.

101
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,851
So I'm not leaving you again,
no matter what.

102
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:05,055
Who turned out the moon?

103
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:07,563
Don't go near that cake, thief!

104
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,432
Stop, thief!

105
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,468
Oh, are you okay thief?

106
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,124
Overreacting my hoof.

107
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,585
I knew I was going to have
to keep a close eye on you.

108
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,157
And that's just what I'm gonna do.

109
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:43,003
The cake!

110
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:48,219
You look mmmm-marvelous.

111
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:57,459
I know. I think some congratulations
are in order for a job well done.

112
00:07:57,785 --> 00:08:02,483
You better hold off on giving yourself
an award just yet Pinkie... look!

113
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:03,947
Look at what?!

114
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:14,803
What is it?

115
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:15,878
What happened?

116
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,021
It's the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

117
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,600
It's been... mutilated!

118
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:24,228
Now, we just need
to find out who done it.

119
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,121
You mean, who "did it".

120
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:28,978
Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.

121
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,538
Well, having read many mystery novels,

122
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,978
I know that the only way to
discover the culprit is to investigate.

123
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,129
Exactly.

124
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:43,731
And as chief detective,
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

125
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:47,355
- You're investigatin'?
- Yes!

126
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,532
And Twilight shall be
my lowly assistant

127
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:52,809
who asks silly questions
with obvious answers.

128
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,127
Fine, Pinkie.

129
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,339
Should we start looking for clues?

130
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,075
Perfect silly question,
my dear Twilight.

131
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:02,452
Because the obvious answer is...

132
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:04,158
Yes?

133
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,718
No! 'Cause I know who did it.

134
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,862
Pinkie, how could you possibly know?

135
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:12,894
How could I possibly not know?

136
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:15,656
Clearly, this dastardly deed
was done by the baker

137
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,629
who knew their dessert
could not measure up

138
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,441
to the mastery of the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

139
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:24,887
I guess you feared
your éclairs lacked flair...

140
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,844
Gustave!

141
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:03,878
Thus, destroying the cake,
and the Cakes' chance

142
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:06,267
of winning the
National Dessert Competition.

143
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:07,918
But it makes no sense!

144
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:09,832
What do you mean, lowly assistant?

145
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:12,209
Well first, if you were tied
to the train tracks,

146
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,648
how are you now here?

147
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:18,288
Guess that isn't
a totally silly question.

148
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,778
And second, the cake hasn't been sliced,
it's been bitten.

149
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,544
Just look at the teeth marks!

150
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,626
You're right, my fine fellow.

151
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,698
Gustave Le Grand
is clearly in the clear.

152
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:33,036
Which means the "MMMM"
was destroyed by another baker.

153
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:36,741
A baker whose doughnuts are do-nots.

154
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:39,661
That's right, it was Joe!

155
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:48,151
Or as he's known in the spy world,
Mane. Con Mane.

156
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,240
Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!

157
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:39,678
Pinkie!

158
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,317
There is no laser beam security system.

159
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,031
And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane!

160
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:46,971
He's big, gruff, and messy!

161
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:51,664
Although, you would look
rather dapper in a tuxedo.

162
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:54,578
You may be right, lowly assistant.

163
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:55,798
May be?

164
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,278
Now that I'm taking
a closer look at these desserts,

165
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:01,907
I see that one simply cannot
look me in the eye.

166
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:04,774
Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!

167
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:05,825
Yes!

168
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:10,467
And the mule behind the moose panicked
when she saw the mastery of the "MMMM".

169
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:13,230
So you're saying that the culprit is...

170
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:15,748
Mulia Mild!

171
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,052
Putting an end to the Cakes'
dreams of taking first prize.

172
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:49,858
I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia.

173
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,128
Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous!
Look at her!

174
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,388
I guess you're right...

175
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:58,539
Thank you!

176
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,193
But I was so sure that it was
one of the other bitter bakers

177
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:02,944
that destroyed the "MMMM".

178
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:06,158
That way, their delicious dessert
would reign supreme.

179
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,086
I mean, just look at Joe's Doughnutopia.

180
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:12,678
It's a spectacular city
of doughnutty delight,

181
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,358
topped temptingly
in sprinklicious sprinkles.

182
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:21,616
And Gustave's éclairs look incredibly
edible, with glistening glaziness.

183
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,218
But then, there's
Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose.

184
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:29,557
Why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous
mousse moose tempts the taste buds

185
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,527
with this silky, smooth, yummy-nummy,
chocolateyness.

186
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:37,281
So, why did this criminal devour the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

187
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:40,253
while leaving this trio
of tasty treats untouched?

188
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,288
Now I have no idea who do-doned it!

189
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:02,587
This mystery gets more mysterious
every minute.

190
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:06,254
Well, you have to stop the wild
accusations and get to the truth.

191
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:09,970
Everypony go back to your cars
while we do a little investigating.

192
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:15,298
Okay Pinkie, in order to
really solve this mystery,

193
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,871
we're going to have to find clues.

194
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:22,810
Now you were here,
at the scene of the crime all night.

195
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:25,254
You're not accusing me, are you?

196
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:26,654
No!

197
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:29,437
But maybe you saw something
that will help us.

198
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,977
I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!

199
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,897
Good... let's retrace your steps.

200
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:44,255
Then, I chased the culprit down
the train towards the caboose.

201
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,360
But when I got there, he was gone.

202
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:55,561
Our first clue.

203
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,827
I think I know who did it, Pinkie.

204
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:04,507
- Already?
- Yes.

205
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,770
But I need more evidence to confirm.

206
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:08,330
Tell me what happened next.

207
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:13,729
I heard somepony else in the dessert car,
and chased them up to the engine.

208
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:18,727
But, when I got there, all I saw
was the conductor shoveling coal.

209
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:20,630
The conductor, huh?

210
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:25,982
But, that doesn't make any sense.

211
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:35,863
What happened next, Pinkie?

212
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:38,787
Well... I went back to the dessert car.

213
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,352
Yes?

214
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,434
The curtains mysteriously closed,
all on their own.

215
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:59,202
Interesting. Anything else?

216
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:01,869
I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud.

217
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,256
And then they were gone!

218
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:07,327
When I opened the curtains,
I saw that the portrait by the door

219
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:08,778
was all crooked.

220
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,448
Oh my, what is that?

221
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,195
What next, Pinkie?

222
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:25,015
That's it. I was here guarding
the cake the rest of the night.

223
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,879
I mean... I slept by the cake
the rest of the night.

224
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,326
And when you woke up,
half the cake was gone?

225
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:34,277
Exactly.

226
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,654
By Jove, I think I've got it.

227
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:38,601
Call everypony back.

228
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:40,708
We have a cake culprit to catch.

229
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:46,701
Why are we all here again?

230
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:50,180
I bet you're wondering
why you're all here again.

231
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:51,831
She's good.

232
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:55,794
We have discovered the true culprit
of this cake carnage.

233
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:57,574
But how?

234
00:16:57,825 --> 00:17:00,344
Well you see, when committing a crime,

235
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:03,329
it's crucial that one
never leaves behind clues.

236
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,134
Especially an obvious clue like... this.

237
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,359
A blue feather.

238
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,268
I knew it was you, Gustave Le Grand.

239
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,436
Pinkie, Gustave doesn't
have blue feathers.

240
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:20,335
No, 'cause he's been dying them!

241
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,297
No, Pinkie.

242
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:24,375
Remember how when you chased
the suspect to the caboose,

243
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:25,826
they suddenly disappeared?

244
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:28,246
That's because they flew away.

245
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:31,104
But the thief did leave
a little something behind...

246
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:33,845
didn't you, Rainbow Dash?

247
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:36,274
I don't even like cake!

248
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:40,647
So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!

249
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,477
Case not solved, because
when we went to the engine,

250
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:44,828
I saw the conductor's hat.

251
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:48,598
And inside the hat was... this.

252
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:53,538
So it was you, that pink hair came
from your rainbow colored mane!

253
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:56,272
I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!

254
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:57,423
So you're wearing a wig?

255
00:17:58,427 --> 00:17:59,437
Cut it out!

256
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:01,165
Pinkie, remember?

257
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:04,042
You chased a pony to the engine,
where you thought you saw

258
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:05,517
the conductor shoveling coal.

259
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,433
But that wasn't the conductor at all.

260
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,823
It was... Fluttershy.

261
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,773
You're going down, Fluttershy.

262
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:14,924
Pinkie!

263
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,674
But then another clue
confounded my suspicions.

264
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,550
You were guarding the cake
when the curtains mysteriously closed.

265
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,070
But that's no mystery, that's magic.

266
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:27,545
But when the thief tried
to make their great escape,

267
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:30,320
they left a little addition to the portrait.

268
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,327
Has anypony else noticed
that Rarity is wearing

269
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,141
her hair rather differently today?

270
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:41,667
What? Is it a crime to change
one's style every now and again?

271
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,803
Why, I think it's a crime not to.

272
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:45,377
Really?

273
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:50,036
Fine, I'm guilty!

274
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:51,932
I wear false eyelashes.

275
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:55,353
Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.

276
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:56,904
So did I.

277
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:59,285
Oh nuts, so did I.

278
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:01,360
You just made it sound
so delectable.

279
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:02,511
So tasty.

280
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:04,419
And boy was it!

281
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,763
I only meant to take a little,
lady-like bite.

282
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,214
And it was so good.

283
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,466
Yeah, I just dove right in!

284
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,647
But I'm really really sorry.

285
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:15,098
Terribly sorry.

286
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,095
Sorry, Pinkie.

287
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:18,805
That's okay.

288
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:22,191
At least this mystery
is finally solved.

289
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:23,242
But it isn't.

290
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:26,030
We figured out who ate the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness,

291
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:29,290
but we still don't know who devoured
the other bakers' goods.

292
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:32,195
You're right, Twilight.
You know what we have to do?

293
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:35,538
Well, yes I do. Do you?

294
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,927
Look for clues!

295
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:51,092
Well, Pinkie. Did you find
the devourer of the desserts?

296
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:55,753
I most certainly did.
It was, none other than...

297
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:58,738
the bakers!

298
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:04,097
First of all, Gustave has mousse
in his moustache.

299
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:08,732
And Joe has éclair in his hair.

300
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:15,233
And Mulia has sprinkles
in her freckles!

301
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,427
What do you say, bakers?

302
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:20,827
Oh I am so sorry, Mulia.

303
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:24,445
But Pinkie made your
mousse moose sound...

304
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:25,996
<i>très magnifique.</i>

305
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:30,792
And Pinkie's description of your éclairs
really did make 'em sound scrumptious.

306
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:34,491
And the way she spoke
of your Doughnutopia,

307
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:37,507
it was too delectable to resist.

308
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,938
Well everypony,
we finally have the mystery solved.

309
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:49,124
Yes, but now we don't have any desserts
to enter into the contest!

310
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:52,663
I think we can fix that. Come on!

311
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:56,833
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

312
00:20:56,984 --> 00:21:00,473
<i>today I learned that it's not good
to jump to conclusions.</i>

313
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:04,146
<i>You have to find out all the facts
before saying somepony did something.</i>

314
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:08,477
<i>If you don't, you could end up blaming
somepony for something they never did.</i>

315
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:13,613
<i>This could hurt their feelings,
and it can make you look really foolish.</i>

316
00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:17,793
<i>So from now on, I'll always
make sure to get all the facts.</i>

317
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:20,970
How's that for a lesson,
Princess Celestia?
