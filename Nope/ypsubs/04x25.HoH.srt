when Cerberus

162

left his post at
the gates.

163

But that was a long time ago.

Why is he just now
starting to steal magic?

165
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:16,481
His time in Tartarus
left him very weak.

166
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,335
He has just now gained enough
strength to use his dark powers.

167
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,828
But with each passing moment,
he grows stronger still.

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,538
And I know just the
Princess who could stop him.

169
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,144
Yes! I'll find him and--

<i>No, Twilight,</i>

171

He can sense when there's a
magical imbalance.

179
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:49,966
The next time
Tirek steals magic,

You want some company?

Applejack: It has been a while

we had to give
back the Elements.

Harmony wouldn't have survived.

320
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,486
you represent wasn't easy.

321
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:50,259
Fluttershy, it was when you
realized that the way to show

322
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,444
kindness to the Breezies was by
forcing them to leave your home.

323
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:56,107
<i>The looks on their</i>
<i>poor little faces.</i>

324
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,850
<i>But I knew that as</i>
<i>difficult as it was,</i>

325
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,765
pushing them away was the
kindest thing I could do.

326
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:09,650
Rarity, even after Suri took
advantage of your generosity

327
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:10,901
at Fashion Week
in Manehattan,

328
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:13,929
<i>you didn't let it cause you to</i>
<i>abandon your generous spirit.</i>

329
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:16,033
I simply couldn't have
lived with myself

330
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,929
if I didn't do something
special for the friends

331
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:20,380
who have always been
so generous to me.

332
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:23,810
Rainbow Dash, you had the chance
to fly with the Wonderbolts

333
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,116
at the Equestria Games

334
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:27,783
but instead you chose to
compete with your friends.

335
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,977
Sure. But being loyal to my
friends was way ...

336
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:32,144
My turn! My turn!

337
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,711
Pinkie Pie, you realized that
seeing your friend laugh

338
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:38,540
was more important than proving
you were a better party planner

339
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,666
than Cheese Sandwich.

340
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,970
Best party I've ever had.

341

moments to shine, Twilight,

this have to do

344
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:49,553
with the opening of the chest?

345
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,875
All of you had tough
choices to make,

346
00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:54,667
<i>but when you made the right</i>
<i>one and embraced your Element,</i>

347
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:57,190

<i>make the right choice too.</i>

348
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,834
<i>Each of you received</i>
<i>something from the pony</i>

349
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,293
<i>whose life you helped change.</i>

350
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,350
I know it sounds crazy, but
maybe there's something special

351
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:07,361
about those objects that could
lead us to the location

352
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,204
of the keys.

353
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,647
The chest is connected
to the Tree of Harmony.

354
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:12,967
The Tree is connected
to the Elements,

355
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,248
and the Elements are
connected to all of us.

356
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:17,358
There must be a connection!

357

I hate to admit it,
but maybe Discord

358
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:21,644
was trying to be a
good friend after all.

359
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,425
I don't see anything on them

They're just ordinary,
