00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,960
First lesson of the day. We
very carefully set the table

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,700
without using magic
so that-- YIPES!

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,080
Did you-- how-- when-- what?

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,440
What?

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,160
I said no magic. You were
supposed to do it by hoof

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,080
so I could work in
a friendship lesson.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,540
Oh. I heard set the table
and just kinda went for it.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,720
Well, if you
hadn't used magic,

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,700
you'd have heard
me say, uh,

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,600
this plate represents your
head, this spoon is your heart

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,140
and the knives... are sharp.
Always be careful with knives.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,880
[sigh]

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,020
The metaphors make more
sense when you're actually

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,520
setting the table.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,780
Should I change it back?

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,180
I just want to make sure
you're ready for this dinner.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,560
Princess Celestia will be
joining us tomorrow night

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,360
to see how the friendship
lessons are going.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,900
If it's just you, me
and Princess Celestia,

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,530
why are there
four seats?

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,400
Well, the whole point is for
you to bring a new friend.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,520
That way the Princess
will see for herself

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,670
just how far
you've come.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,240
And how good a
teacher you have.

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,920
I can't choose. I
like all your friends.

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,180
That's the best part. You
have to make a new friend.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,900
New friends?

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,280
Hey, maybe I'll just
force friendships

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,040
by magically enslaving
the entire population

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,250
of Ponyville!

32
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,020
Starlight!

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,140
Kidding! Heh heh heh.

https://yp1.yayponies.no/

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,125
Let's see. Make new
friends in Ponyville,

36
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,400
the friendliest
place in Equestria.

37
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,025
Shouldn't be hard.

38
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,725
Need to make a new
friend, huh?

39
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,575
I know just the
pony for you!

40
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,025
Ms. Starlight
Glimmer,

41
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:28,150
meet Mrs. Cake.

42
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,450
How are you, dearie?

43
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,700
Are you baking?
Can I help?

44
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,100
Wow. Mrs. Cake! Look what
your "new friend" made you.

45
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:50,050
Ah ha ha! New friend? I like
the sound of that. [gasp]

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,725
Howza-whoza!

47
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,725
Are you trying to put
me out of business

48
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:56,050
with your fancy
magica-thingy-whatsit cake?

49
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,050
[splat]

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,375
Oh!

51
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,100
Sorry!

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,725
[slurp]

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,925
In her defense,
it is delicious.

54
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,025
[chomp]

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,620
[crash]

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,825
I think I have just the
pony for you, Starlight.

57
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:16,250
Meet Big Mac.

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,475
Eyup.

59
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,150
He's not much
of a talker.

60
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:23,360
Nope.

61
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:26,750
Oh that's too bad. I
love a good conversation.

62
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:38,125
Eyyyyyyyyup-yup-yeah-yeah-you
did something!

63
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,850
Whoa! What's happening?
I feel really weird.

64
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:43,025
I'm talking so much
and I'm so articulate

65
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:45,225
enunciating with such
precise pronunciation!

66
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,225
Annie Apple Awoke
And Accidentally Ate

67
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,500
an Auburn Azalea!
Aaaah! MAKE IT STOP!

68
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:56,530
[growl]

69
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:59,575
I can't be friends with
somepony who doesn't talk.

70
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,150
[growl]

71
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,450
And I guess my first
instinct shouldn't be to

72
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,875
magically command ponies to
act the way I want them to.

73
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:08,350
[louder growl]

74
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,575
All right! I'll
change him back!

75
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,275
The trick to
finding a new friend

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,450
is to render
yourself radiant.

77
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,950
First impressions count
a great deal, you know.

78
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,050
I'm glad you all got
past my first impression.

79
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:25,525
Well, everypony deserves
a second chance!

80
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:29,025
Oh now, I have a
top-notch idea.

81
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,975
I'm thinking pastel
silk here and here,

82
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:33,875
with crinoline underneath.

83
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,500
You really think a new outfit
will help me meet ponies?

84
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:40,150
Oh, with the right outfit,
you can do anything, darling.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,900
When will it be ready?

86
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:42,975
Three weeks.

87
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:45,010
Dinner's tomorrow.

88
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,350
Well, then! How about
a hat from the, ahem,

89
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:49,575
"clearance bin?"

90
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,775
[grunt]

91
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,275
Maybe not.

92
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:01,350
Nopony's gonna make
friends with you

93
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,250
because of your outfit.

94
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,700
The only thing you want a new
friend draped in is coolness.

95
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,650
Like you?

96
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,325
Yeah, but you already
know me, so...

97
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:13,975
[gasp] Spitfire!

98
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:15,600
Sorry.

99
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,740
Who's that?

100
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,075
Only the Wonderboltiest
Pony in the Wonderbolts.

101
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,625
Come on, I'll
introduce you!

102
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,550
You coming or what?

103
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:30,475
I guess my first
question would be...

104
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:32,300
what's a Wonderbolt?

105
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,200
You've never heard
of the Wonderbolts?

106
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:37,950
Where have you been?

107
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:41,525
Heh... enslaving
villages, I guess.

108
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,900
Right.

109
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:50,250
You're adorable, but probably
not what Twilight had in mind.

110
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,725
What is going on?
This is Ponyville!

111
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,625
If I can't make
a friend here,

112
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,625
there's got to be
something wrong with me.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,900
[frustrated sigh]

114
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,025
OK. Calm down.

115
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:10,625
Nobody makes friends
with a total stress case.

116
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:18,025
Stop stressing!
STOP STRESSING!

117
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:38,075
Ahhh. This is just
what I needed.

118
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,665
Tell me about it.

119
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:43,075
You ever have one
of those days?

120
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,750
For me, they're all
one of those days.

121
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:46,770
Ha-ha-ha.

122
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:50,275
I'm going to start coming here
every time I visit Ponyville.

123
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,125
I'm not from here either. I've
been trying to make friends,

124
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,875
but it's not easy.
They're not saying it,

125
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,450
but I think everypony
knows about my past.

126
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,980
I... may have been
a tiny bit...

127
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,275
...completely and
utterly evil?

128
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,875
Ponies judge me on
my past, too.

129
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:12,025
Finally, a pony I
can relate to.

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,575
Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta
spoon, strawberry pick.

131
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:19,275
I'm beginning to think
that after Friendship,

132
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,875
the greatest magic
of all...

133
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,775
is proper silverware
placement. [giggle]

134
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,750
Twilight, guess what!
I made a new friend!

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,750
That's fantastic news.

136
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,000
She's great!

137
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,900
Great!

138
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:31,975
She's powerful!

139
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:33,025
Powerful?

140
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,675
She's--

141
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,425
<i> Hello, Princess.</i>

142
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:38,450
<i> ♪ [horror sting] ♪</i>

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,475
Trixie?

144
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:45,500
You know each other?

145
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:47,200
You could say that.

146
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,650
We've had our
differences.

147
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,975
What matters is Twilight
gave me a second chance

148
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,775
and I appreciate it.

149
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:02,610
So, um, what brings
you to Ponyville?

150
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,225
The great and powerful
Trixie has come to perform

151
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:12,250
a new stage show of grand
illusion. I'm calling it

152
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,625
"The Humble and
Penitent Trixie's

153
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,950
Equestrian Apology Tour."

154
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,630
That's kind of
a mouthful.

155
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
It's a working title.

156
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,150
Starlight? A moment?
Over here?

157
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,050
I know I said make
friends with "anypony,"

158
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,150
but... well, with Trixie's
past and your past,

159
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:36,225
I'm not so sure she's
the best "first friend."

160
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,021
But whatever she did,
you've forgiven her, right?

161
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,150
Of course.

162
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:45,550
It's just...

163
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,725
She wasn't the
nicest pony.

164
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:52,150
Well, you did say anypony
and I just assumed

165
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:54,225
that you'd trust me
to make my own friends

166
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,700
the way Princess
Celestia trusted you.

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,170
[sigh] You're
right. I trust you.

168
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,040
Just be back in
time for the dinner.

169
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,600
Thanks, Twilight.
You won't regret it.

170
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,525
I hope not.

171
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:12,175
Ugh.

172
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:16,725
This Magic Show's gonna
be the greatest thing

173
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,475
Ponyville's ever seen.

174
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:25,263
[soft murmurs]

175
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:30,850
Everypony always says they'll
give you a second chance,

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,700
but deep down,
they never forget.

177
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,075
That's what I'm
worried about.

178
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,040
[sigh]

179
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,150
What is it?

180
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,681
I heard what Twilight said
about me and she's right;

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
I wasn't very nice.

182
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,875
So, I'd understand if you
didn't want to be friends.

183
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,700
Are you kidding?
You're the first pony

184
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,525
I've met who has
any idea how I feel.

185
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,760
Can you keep a secret?

186
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,900
What are friends for?

187
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,100
The things I've done,

188
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,000
I did them because I
was jealous of Twilight.

189
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,030
She's just the
best at everything

190
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:10,700
and I wanted to beat
her at something.

191
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,500
Your secret's
safe with me.

192
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,050
Thanks.

193
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:15,975
Wanna help me
unpack my wagon?

194
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,875
I spend a lot of time on
the road with my wagon,

195
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,575
so it might be
a tad messy.

196
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:27,790
Maybe I can help. I'm pretty
good at organizing stuff.

197
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,500
Magic props,
brainwashed crowds.

198

Shhhhh!

201
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,270
Uh, I'll catch up. I think
there's something in my hoof.

202
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Sure, the wagon's right
around the corner.

203
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,275
So. How's it going
with your new friend?

204
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,750
Great. Thanks for asking in
a completely not creepy way.

205
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,656
Because, you know, if it isn't
working out for any reason,

206
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,700
I could introduce you
to my friend, here.

207
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,500
Nice to meet you.

208
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,063
No, no. You can
come out now.

209
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,090
[electronic buzz]

210
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:08,600
You like music, right?

211
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,300
DJ-Pon3'd be the perfect
friend for tonight's

212
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,100
incredibly important
dinner with Celestia.

213
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,525
You know, if you decide to
make a last minute change.

214
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:21,475
So... back at your castle
when you said, "I trust you,"

215
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,725
you meant, "I
don't trust you."

216
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:28,780
Who can really say who said
what? I know I can't. Can you?

217
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,525
Starlight, I'm just trying
to look out for you.

218
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,150
[sigh] I appreciate it, but
you're wrong about Trixie.

219
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:40,025
She's just like me. We
have a real connection.

220
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,800
That's kind of what I'm afraid
of. OH! What about her!

221
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,475
[crash/thud]

222
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:49,950
Please, Twilight! I know
you're trying to help,

223
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,740
but I need to make
friends on my own

224
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,625
if I'm going to
become a better pony.

225
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,825
But do you really
think Trixie is the one

226
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:57,975
to help you with that?

227
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:00,475
Wow, Trixie was right.

228
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,925
You're not really giving
her a second chance.

229
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,150
I wonder what that says
about how you feel about me.

230
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:13,490
Oh! Now he'd be PERFECT!

231
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,730
Ugh.

232
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:21,750
I was thinking.

233
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,475
You said Twilight is better
than you at everything,

234
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,525
but that's not true.
You're better at magic.

235
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:30,125
Only when I'm wearing a
soul-sucking evil amulet,

236
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,925
so I don't think
that counts.

237
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,650
Funny story. Don't
need to get into it.

238
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,520
I meant stage magic.

239
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:42,300
Well, of course. Great?
Yes. Powerful? Obviously.

240
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,675
But I'm not the best.

241
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:47,360
As great and powerful
as I am,

242
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,025
there's one trick I've
never been able to do.

243
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,500
The Moon-shot
Manticore Mouth Dive.

244
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,125
<i> ♪ [old-style piano] ♪</i>

245
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,970
Only one magician has
ever pulled it off:

246
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:01,650
my hero, Hoofdini.

247
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,400
You are supposed to blast
yourself into the open mouth

248
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,375
of a hungry Manticore.

249
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,000
After the Manticore chews
you up and swallows you,

250
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,175
you magically step
out of a box

251
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,100
on the other side
of the stage.

252
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,650
Completely unharmed.

253
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,500
That sounds very...

254
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,325
Dangerous?

255
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,275
I was going to
say, "cool."

256
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,930
I knew I liked you
for a reason.

257
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,625
I don't know how he did it.

258
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:33,775
If I tried it, I'd get
chewed up and swallowed

259
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,825
by that Manticore.

260
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,650
Not if you could
use real magic.

261
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,625
Obviously. Way
to rub it in.

262
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:44,575
No, I mean I could help.
You could start the trick

263
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,075
and right before
you got chewed up,

264
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,950
I could use magic
to save you

265
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,090
and make you appear
in the black box.

266
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,425
I guess that would work.

267
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,900
But if you made one
mistake, I'd be a goner.

268
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:02,040
When it comes to magic,
I don't make mistakes.

269
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:05,625
Maybe I could be your...
"magic-show-helper-pony?"

270
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,410
We call it "assistant" in
the magician biz and...

271
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,325
nopony's ever offered
to help before.

272
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,100
Well, I'd be honored.

273
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,325
You may have just made my
great and powerful magic show

274
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,500
even better, which I
didn't think was possible.

275
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,825
We're gonna blow
them away tonight!

276
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,650
Oh, I can't. Tonight's this

277
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:31,330
"incredibly important"
dinner with Twilight.

278
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,725
Oh.

279
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,900
Can I vent for a minute?

280
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,440
What are friends for?

281
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,025
Even after Twilight
says she trusts me,

282
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:41,975
she clearly doesn't
trust me enough

283
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:43,775
to choose my own friends.

284
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,725
I guess you were right.
No second chances.

285
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:51,950
I wish I could say
I was surprised.

286
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,825
Well, lucky for
"Princess" Twilight

287
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,350
I have my magic
show tonight.

288
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,075
If you have to go
to the dinner,

289
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,200
I completely understand.

290
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:06,400
I just hope I find
a way to survive

291
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:11,140
the Moon-Shot Manticore Mouth

Our friendship lessons
are going so well.

298
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:40,400
She made three
new friends!

299
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:43,950
She has such great
taste in friends.

300
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,375
I don't know where she
would have learned that.

301
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:50,900
Starlight Glimmer? I thought
you said nose-hair trimmers!

302
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,975
What's going on? I'm hungry!
And my nose is too hairy!

303
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,390
HAHA! Cranky Doodle,
you're so funny!

304
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:03,100
If you'll excuse me, I'm
going to check the kitchen.

305
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,650

the... artichokes.

seen Starlight Glimmer?

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm looking for her.

308
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,700
Trixie!

309
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:23,600
So this is the "The Humble
and Penitent Trixie's

310
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,210
Equestrian Apology Tour."

311

Ain't that a
mouthful of molasses.

00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:33,200
This is going to be the
greatest night of my life.

314
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:36,120
Excuse me, our lives.

315
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:39,225
I'm so glad that we're
not at that boring dinner.

316
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,525
Twilight: Ahem.

317
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:44,575
You just decided to skip our
dinner without telling me?

318
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,875
Are you aware that
at this very moment,

319
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,725
Princess Celestia is
waiting for you at a table--

320
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,275
--with exquisite
silverware placement?

321
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,625
Yes, but...

322
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:55,275
This is exactly why

323
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,850
I didn't want you to make
friends with Trixie.

324
00:16:57,175 --> 00:17:00,475
Ah-HA! You still
don't trust me!

325
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:02,725
But guess what, "princess?"

326
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:05,350
It doesn't matter if you want
to give me a second chance

327
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,660
or not. Starlight had to
choose between you and me

328
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:16,260
and she chose me! Your pupil
chose me! So HA. I win!

329
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,300
You win? That sounds like you
just made friends with me

330
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:22,500
to beat Twilight.

331
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,275
Exactly!

332
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,775
Wait. I mean, no! I got caught
up in the moment. I like you.

333
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,500
Beating Twilight
is just a bonus.

334
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,775
Oh, saying that
didn't help, did it.

335
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,025
I should have known.
Nopony else in Ponyville

336
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,650
wanted to be my
friend. Why would you?

337
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:46,760
Wait! It's not like
that! I am your friend!

338
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,660
Oh. [whimper]

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,100
Well, you "won." I
hope you're happy.

340
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:56,475
Looks like the great
and powerful Trixie

341
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,750
is back to a solo show...

342
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,875
Trixie?

343
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:05,410
...which is exactly
the way she likes it.

344
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:08,075
Thank you,
Princess Twilight,

345
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,075
for getting rid of
that annoying pony

346
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:14,300
who wanted to be my first
friend. I am not sad at all.

347
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,350
I definitely don't feel
like my heart is breaking

348
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,850
into a million pieces.

349
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,425
Come one, come all!
Come and see

350
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:31,125
"The Pathetic and Friendless
Trixie's Way-To-Go-Dumb-Dumb

351
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,840
You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-
Time Repentance Tour."

352
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:36,810
[murmurs from the crowd]

353
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,225
IT'S A WORKING TITLE!

354
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,025
Behold, your fears come true...

355
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,120
a pony-eating MANTICORE,

356
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,300
[ferocious growl]

357
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:51,225
for tonight, the great
and powerful Trixie

358
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:55,300
will be performing the
Moon-shot Manticore Mouth Dive.

359
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:56,600
[excited gasps]

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,450
Now, now. Save your gasps
for when I defy the beast's

361
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:05,875
jaws of doom and appear
inside that black box.

362
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,450
I was supposed to
perform this trick

363
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,975
with my great and
powerful assistant,

364
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,250
who was also my great
and powerful friend.

365
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,500
Starlight? When I first
came to Ponyville,

366
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,620
Princess Celestia gave me
room to make my own decisions

367
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:28,160
and my own friends. I need to
give you the same freedom.

368
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,225
I shouldn't have tried

369
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:30,750
to pick and choose
your friends for you.

370
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:36,975
Just like me, you have to
make your own decisions...

371
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,525
and your own friends.

372
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,880
But, what if Trixie really was
using me just to one up you?

373
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,725
From what I've seen...
she's the real thing.

374
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,750
But it's not my place to
judge. It's all up to you.

375
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,600
[roar]

376
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:01,075
Starlight? If
you're out there

377
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,975
and you still want
to be friends,

378
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:06,400
let's be great and
powerful together.

379
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:07,850
Please.

380
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,500
[roar]

381
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:15,400
Ahhhhh!

382
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,125
[gulp]

383
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,225
[burp]

384
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,150
[shocked cries from the crowd]

385
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,350
Behold, the pate and
growerful Triskee!

386
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,250
[thud]

387
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:43,900
[cheering]

388
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,925
And now, I'm proud
to introduce

389
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,750
my great and powerful
assistant...

390
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,425
and best friend...
Starlight Glimmer!

391
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:57,775
[cheers]

392
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,125
Trixie!

393
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,675
What do you want?

394
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,075
I was wrong,
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,960
And I have to hand
it to you.

396
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,300
I could never have pulled
off a trick like that.

397
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:13,400
Thank you... Princess.

398
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,900
[explosions]

399
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:27,387
[dripping]

400
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,550
How do you get yer hair
to do that all the time?
