1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,720
I'll never understand
the ponies in this town.

2
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,100
Everywhere I went, they
were all gussied up

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,450
and looking at me funny.

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,000
Kept asking if I
was nervous.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,640
Did they forget the
wedding is tomorrow?

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,400
Ah, maybe they're
just as excited

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,300
for us to be
married as I am.

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,860
Aw!

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,960
Well, they're going
to feel awfully silly

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,340
when they realize they've
got the wrong date.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,740
THE INVITATIONS ARE WRONG!

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,740
THIS SAYS THE WEDDING IS TODAY!

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,960
But I got such a
good deal on them.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,360
Everypony in
town got these!

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,320
The princesses have even RSVP'd!

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,400
I told you we
should have eloped!

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,280
Oh dear!

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,040
The caterer, the
flowers, the musicians!

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,800
We've got to move
it all to today!

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,680
What?

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,120
Where's my wedding planner?

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,100
You told me you could do it for
half what the others charge!

23
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,080
And then you
sent invitations

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,780
to everypony in town
with the wrong date!

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,780
Muffin?

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:37,960
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,420
I really messed up
on those invitations.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,260
I feel just awful, Doc.

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,340
Hmph. Perhaps that explains
why I never got mine.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,380
I told Cranky I could get
'em printed for cheap,

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,600
but that meant hiring
somepony with no experience

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,120
using a printing press.

33
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,610
Oh, I wish there was a way
I could go back in time

34
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,800
and fix all this.

35
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,060
Going back in time is
old thinking, my friend.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,620
I was working off a
cutting edge theory

37
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,340
of making time come
forward to you!

38
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,020
My life's work, decades,
hm, centuries really,

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,860
of research and experimentation.

40
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,160
And I nearly had it cracked.

41
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,260
Turns out there's a
magic spell for it. Who knew?

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,680
But there are so many
things that magic can't explain!

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,580
Where science and mathematics
are the real magic!

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,440
Like these?

45
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,020
They're pretty!

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,160
Ah, yes. My flameless fireworks.

47
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,420
I never could quite figure
out how to get them to ignite.

48
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,660
How did you learn to make
all this stuff, anyway?

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,520
I've been studying
science my whole life!

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,820
Ever since a particularly
traumatic experience as a foal,

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,640
I've been looking for
ways to make sense

52
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
of the world around me.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,780
Science provides
explanations of things

54
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,480
we never thought possible!

55
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,640
Now. Why did we
come here again?

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,120
Yeah, oh!

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,960
Because I accidentally
sent out invitations

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,720
for Cranky and
Matilda's wedding

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,420
with today's date
instead of tomorrow's.

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,040
Great whickering stallions,
I completely forgot!

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,200
And I still need to
get my suit tailored!

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,740
Rarity?

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Rarity!

64
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,760
Please, you've got to help me!

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,600
I lost track of
time, unbelievably,

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,540
and forgot that the
wedding is this afternoon!

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,260
Have you seen Rarity?

68
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,000
She's got to alter the
sleeves of my suit

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,420
and she's got to do it now!

70
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,440
Oh, ha ha! Thank goodness!

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,660
Lead on, my friend!

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,220
Why have you brought me here?

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,430
Rarity would never
set hoof in...

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,760
Great whickering stallions,
they've got style!

75
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,480
Gentlecolts!

76
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm facing certain calamity
and I couldn't help noticing

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,660
your remarkable
fashion sense!

78
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,500
Could I get the name of
your incredible tailor?

79
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,320
Well, yeah man, his
name is me.

80
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,060
Me. What an unfortunate name.

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,140
No, man, like, I manufacture
all my own garments.

82
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,400
We all do, man.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,280
Then you've got to help me!
I need this suit tailored!

84
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,120
It's an emergency!

85
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,510
Ha ha ha. Sorry, man, we're
just about to start the finals.

86
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,600
What's this word
you keep using... "man"?

87
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,700
I don't know, man,
but guess what?

88
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,680
Our fourth didn't show.

89
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,320
So if you roll with us,
we'll alter your suit for ya.

90
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm sorry, gentlecolts,
but I will not bowl.

91
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,330
The splits! The spares! There
are simply too many variables!

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,620
Variables? What are you
talkin' about, man?

93
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,300
Just throw the ball straight.

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,980
Hold on. Straight?

95
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,280
Very well. I'll try your
"straight" technique.

96
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,700
It just might be
crazy enough to work.

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,690
Do we know what
they're on about?

98
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,000
The way they're
huddled up like that?

99
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,340
I'd say it's either a friendship
problem or a monster attack.

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,900
A monster attack? Blast!

101
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,380
I'm performing at the
ceremony this afternoon

102
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,840
and I still haven't
sorted out what to play.

103
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,540
How am I meant to practice with
a monster invading Ponyville?

104
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,460
Maybe it's just a
friendship problem

105
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,800
and it'll all be cleared up
in a half an hour or so.

106
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,940
Ugh. I hope so.

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Where's Pinkie Pie? I need
my wedding planner!

108
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,900
Oh no! On my wedding day?

109
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,480
SOMEPONY'S GOT TO HELP ME!

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,440
You!

111
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,720
Me?

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,140
I need to move an entire
wedding from tomorrow to today!

113
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,300
But nopony's asked me
to organize anything

114
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,720
since Twilight came to town!

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,880
So you'll do it?

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,020
I used to be the best
organizer in all of Ponyville.

117
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,260
You bet I'll--

118
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,180
Ahh!

119
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,140
Come on, we'd better
get to the salon

120
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,960
before that monster
flattens it!

121
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,920
What am I gonna do?

122
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,340
Matilda!

123
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,160
I feel so bad about
the invitations!

124
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,120
Is there anything I can do?

125
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,900
FLOWERS!

126
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,060
You want Matilda's
arrangements today?

127
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,280
This is awful!

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,540
The horror! The horror!

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
So there's no way you can do it?

130
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,520
We don't even have
Matilda's flowers in yet,

131
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,720
much less arranged.

132
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,840
Oh. This is a disaster!

133
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay. Thanks anyway.

134
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,540
Look, girls!

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,540
A broken stem on
one of the zinnias!

136
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,680
WHAT?

137
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,980
Oh the horror!

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
The horror!

139
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,140
I have to admit, when Matilda
said we needed this place

140
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,360
ready by today, I was
a little nervous.

141
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,940
With you by my side, I knew
we'd get it done in time.

142
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,320
There is nothing like a
best friend, is there?

143
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,640
Anything's possible
when you know somepony

144
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,380
as well as we know each other.

145
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,100
What was that?

146
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,640
There's some monster attacking
Ponyville or something.

147
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,120
What is it this time, a creature
from the Ever-Free Forest?

148
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,140
Uh, I think it's
some sort of Bugbear.

149
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,500
Did you say Bugbear?

150
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,380
He found me.

151
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,480
What are you talking
about, Bon Bon?

152
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,380
My name isn't Bon Bon; it's
Special Agent Sweetie Drops.

153
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,080
I work for a super-secret
anti-monster agency in Canterlot.

154
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,260
Or at least I did until the
Bugbear went missing

155
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,840
from Tartarus a few years back.

156
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,420
What are you talking about?

157
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,300
When it escaped, we had to
shutter the whole agency.

158
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,860
Every last shred of evidence

159
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,040
of the organization's
existence was destroyed.

160
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,720
Celestia demanded
complete deniability.

161
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,160
What?

162
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,020
It was me who
captured the Bugbear.

163
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,880
I had to go deep cover
here in Ponyville

164
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,340
and assume the name Bon Bon.

165
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
I never thought it'd
be able to track me.

166
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,640
But now it has.

167
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,840
Are you saying our whole
friendship was based on a lie?

168
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm sorry, Lyra, I couldn't tell
you for your own protection.

169
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,020
But, but the lunches,
the, the long talks,

170
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,460
the benches we've sat on!

171
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,300
None of that was real?

172
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
It was all real.

173
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,400
You're my very best friend.

174
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,820
I've got to go find a
crowd to blend into

175
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,060
before I put you in danger.

176
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,300
I'll see you at the wedding.

177
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,140
Fine. But we're going to
talk about this later!

178
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,600
I need my ring today,
no matter the cost!

179
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,060
As long as it doesn't
cost any extra.

180
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
7-10 split, man.
Harshest of the harsh.

181
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,320
But if you pick this up,
we win the whole shebang.

182
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,240
Doc! I finally figured
out how I can help!

183
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Your flameless fireworks
look just like flowers!

184
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,440
I'll use them for the wedding!

185
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,840
Great whickering
stallions. Wait!

186
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,360
Wait!

187
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,920
The flameless fireworks
are extremely volatile!

188
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,600
Without knowing
what the trigger is,

189
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,120
they could go off at any moment!

190
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,060
My word, is that a Bugbear?

191
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,880
There are so many
things I'm forgetting!

192
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,800
I hope Cranky remembers
to tell the musicians.

193
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,960
Oh, oh! I'll never get
my mane done in time!

194
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,600
You must relax, my dear!
We can handle anything.

195
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,640
We once did a pony's
hair during the ceremony.

196
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,080
Oh, it's true!
It's true!

197
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,760
They really are the best!

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,160
Matilda, I've just got to say I
already feel like we're family.

199
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,520
You do?

200
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,800
Of course!

201
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm Stephen Magnet,
Cranky's best beast!

202
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,140
You're Stephen Magnet?

203
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,820
Well, what'd you
expect, a Bugbear?

204
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,920
I've known Cranky forever!

205
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,900
Surely he must have told
you about the time

206
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,680
he saved me from
Flashfreeze Lake.

207
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,780
You're Stephen Magnet?

208
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,060
Oh, I know, I KNOW!

209
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,020
Typical Cranky to leave
out minor details,

210
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,560
like the fact that I'm, you
know, a sea monster, right?

211
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh, I just love that old burro.

212
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,180
I'm sorry, Stephen, I guess
I assumed you were a pony.

213
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,700
And I had no idea you had
such adventures together.

214
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,680
Oh, honey! You don't
know the half of it.

215
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,300
But let me tell you something:

216
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,240
in all that we've been
through together,

217
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,240
the only thing he ever
cared about was finding you.

218
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,340
Really?

219
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,240
Well, that and a
baldness cure.

220
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,000
He is the sweetest
thing, isn't he?

221
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,720
All the stress I've
put myself through.

222
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,500
All the stress I've
put him through!

223
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,720
The only thing that matters
is that we're together.

224
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,300
The wedding isn't the important
thing; the marriage is.

225
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,260
Oh, my goodness gracious!

226
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,320
If you believe that, I have
got a bridge to sell you!

227
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,900
All these ponies
travelling to Ponyville,

228
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,640
putting on
uncomfortable clothes,

229
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,400
sitting through a
long ceremony...

230
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,140
you think any of them
care about the marriage?

231
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,580
Honey, the wedding
is EVERYTHING!

232
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,760
Ugh, all these wedding
songs are so standard.

233
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
I want Matilda and Cranky's
wedding to be special.

234
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,820
Thanks, but I'm not sure that's
appropriate for a wedding, is it?

235
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,500
That's more like it!

236
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,620
STOP!

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm going to be late
for the wedding!

238
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,160
What is life?

239
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,820
Is it nothing more than the
endless search for a Cutie Mark?

240
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,400
And what is a Cutie Mark
but a constant reminder

241
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,320
that we're all only one Bugbear
attack away from oblivion?

242
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,460
And what of the poor
gator, flank forever blank,

243
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,340
destined to an existential
swim down the river of life

244
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,820
to an unknowable destiny?

245
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,320
Something like that might work.

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,880
What do you mean, you
left it on the counter?

247
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,460
I thought you
were bringing it!

248
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,720
Well, this is
just wonderful.

249
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,140
I handled the gift for
Cadance and Shining Armor.

250
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,620
You were supposed to
do this one, remember?

251
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,080
Well, we can't just come to
this wedding empty-hoofed!

252
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,700
It's all right. He always
cries at weddings.

253
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,500
Usually it's not until
the wedding starts.

254
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,180
These flameless fireworks
look even better than flowers!

255
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,020
Attention, everypony!

256
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,280
Our friends have done it!

257
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
They've defeated the Bugbear!

258
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,040
Hey.

259
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,120
Hello.

260
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,980
So, uh,you didn't happen to
mention our earlier conversation

261
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,920
about my secret identity
to anypony, did you?

262
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,560
No. I did not.

263
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,440
And you're not the only one
with a secret, you know.

264
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,140
You know those
expensive imported oats

265
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,320
you were saving for
a special occasion?

266
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,440
I cooked them up and
ate them.

267
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,620
All of them.

268
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,740
Whew!

269
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,960
It's sort of thrilling to reveal
your deepest, darkest secrets!

270
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,520
That's what
best friends are for!

271
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,120
Next time you can just bring your
own gift and I'll bring mine.

272
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,160
Fine.

273
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,580
There you are!

274
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,020
My suit has
vanished and this

275
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,480
was the only thing
left in my closet.

276
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,120
How do I look?

277
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
Like a million bits!

278
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,180
Great whickering stallions!
Look at the time!

279
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,000
We'd better get
inside. Allons-y!

280
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,960
I can't believe I lost my hair!

281
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,480
I look ridiculous!

282
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,180
The love of my life
deserves better than this!

283
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,660
Have no fear, Cranky, my dear!

284
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,720
It's Stephen Magnet's
moustache to the rescue!

285
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,060
Aw, thanks, buddy.

286
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,860
No problem.

287
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,360
Now you get in there
and marry that donkey!

288
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,160
Well? Is everypony here?

289
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,880
All set, Mayor!

290
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,220
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here today

291
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,420
to join these two
in maretrimony.

292
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,780
As I look around this room,
I can only imagine

293
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,520
how uncomfortable
Cranky must be.

294
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,300
But I also see so many ponies
from all trots of life

295
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,040
brought together by love.

296
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,660
Cranky searched all across
this great land of ours

297
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,020
to find Matilda.

298
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000
And no matter what
obstacles kept them apart,

299
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,480
love would finally
bring them together,

300
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,300
just as it has brought
all of us together now.

301
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,740
It's remarkable to
me how a story

302
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,720
like Cranky's search for
Matilda could fill this room

303
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
with such a unique
collection of ponies.

304
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,940
It makes you realize
that everypony

305
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,300
is the star of their own story.

306
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,580
And it's not just the main
characters in our stories

307
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,020
that make life so rich.

308
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,860
It's everypony, those
who play big parts

309
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,260
and those who play small.

310
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,700
If it weren't for
everypony in this room

311
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,020
and many more who
couldn't be here today,

312
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,160
Cranky and Matilda's lives
wouldn't be as full

313
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,300
and vibrant as they are.

314
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
And so, in front of all
these loved ones...

315
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,540
Cranky, do you take this donkey
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

316
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,440
You bet I do.

317
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,060
And do you, Matilda,
take this donkey

318
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,120
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

319
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,660
I do.

320
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:39,180
Then I'm proud to say, I now
pronounce you jack and jenny!

321
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
Of course! They need
love to ignite!

322
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,520
How could I have missed it?

323
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,080
You know something, girls?

324
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,120
We are so lucky to
live in this town.

325
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,180
I love you all.

326
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,540
Ow! That's
where the Bugbear bit me.

327
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,480
Sorry.
