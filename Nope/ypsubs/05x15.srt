1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,824
Oh, Sassy Saddles,
don't you just love

2
00:00:11,824 --> 00:00:14,448
my new Femme Mystique
Chic line of gowns?

3
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:17,840
Sequins and sashes,
Rarity, they're exquisite!

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
Where in Equestria did
you find the inspiration?

5
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:24,512
Ooh. I modeled them after The
Adventures of Shadow Spade.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,112
Her stories are always full
of mystery and suspense.

7
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:31,248
And best of all?
Fabulous costumes!

8
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,472
They're perfect.

9
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,152
What are you doing?

10
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:39,360
Oh, uh, just making
some minor adjustments.

11
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:44,320
Shadow Spade believes
it all comes down

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,816
to attention to
detail. And so do I.

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,560
There! Now it's perfect!

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,992
Hey guys! How's it--

15
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:58,352
Heh heh heh. My bad!

16
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:00,350
Hearing impaired subtitles

We have muffins!

17
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:40,160
Sorry I messed up
your dress thingie.

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,260
Nothing we can't
fix in a stitch.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,530
What are you doing
in Canterlot?

20
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:48,608
I'm here for Princess Celestia's
Royal Garden Opening tomorrow.

21
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh, yes.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,600
Rumor has it the gardens are
especially lush this season.

23
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:56,432
I've heard that the Wonderbolts
will be kicking things off

24
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:57,840
with an aerial display.

25
00:01:58,688 --> 00:01:59,850
You heard right.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,048
And Rainbow Dash is
here to fly with them.

27
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:03,168
So exciting!

28
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,232
Well, kind of exciting.
Technically I'm not flying.

29
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:09,408
I'm just the lucky
reserve who was called in

30
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:11,904
to be the back-up flier in case
a Wonderbolt can't perform.

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,208
Oh, don't be so modest!

32
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:17,130
Out of all the reserves,
you were the one chosen.

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,168
It is pretty sweet.

34
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,072
And I do get to
stay in the castle,

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,464
hang out with
the Wonderbolts,

36
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:24,608
and eat awesome food
at the dinner tonight!

37
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,568
Speaking of the dinner,
you're still coming right?

38
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:28,880
Heavens yes!

39
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,904
A chance to dress up, be
charming and show off

40
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:33,600
my newest femme
mystique couture?

41
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:36,496
I wouldn't miss it
for all of Equestia.

42
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:38,464
Great. See you tonight!

43
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:49,160
Ooh, the rhinestones
I ordered!

44
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:54,896
Oh, my, oh, there's
been a mistake!

45
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:58,768
I ordered dragon cut stones
and these are hoof-polished.

46
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:01,984
I'm sorry, but I've got a full
load of deliveries today.

47
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:04,256
I'm not sure I have
time to redo your order.

48
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:12,608
Of course you don't!
Your job is so difficult.

49
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:16,576
Honestly, I don't know how you
keep all those orders straight!

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
It is pretty tough, what with
the boxes all being box-shaped.

51
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:26,384
Oh, yes, and I very
much appreciate it.

52
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:29,040
But if there was any
way you could squeeze in

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,912
one more little delivery, I
would be eternally grateful.

54
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:39,984
Ha ha ha. Well, for you,
Rarity, I'll see what I can do.

55
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:45,790
Rarity, you could sweet
talk a filly out of candy!

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,520
Oh, it was nothing. No
pony minds a compliment!

57
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:53,040
Now, you simply must help me
pick out an outfit for tonight.

58
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:55,280
Something from the new
collection, of course.

59
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:09,568
Let's grab some grub!

60
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:18,360
Mmmmm. Is that
Juniper Phoenix I smell?

61
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,712
No, it's broccoli!

62
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:25,696
<i>Yeah, Juniper Phoenix is one of</i>
<i> my favorite stallion colognes.</i>

63
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:29,456
Mine as well. It's
masculine, and yet soft,

64
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,936
with the barest hint of
floral notes and a --

65
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,400
Rarity, don't you
know who this is?

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,048
A gentlepony with fabulous
taste in colognes and scarves?

67
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:44,944
It's Wind Rider!

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,888
Oh! So nice to meet you.

69
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,960
You didn't let me finish!
He's a living legend!

70
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:54,096
He holds the Wonderbolt record
in the Mustang Marathon.

71
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,576
Well, that was a
long time ago.

72
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:59,860
Honestly, I can't believe
I still hold the record.

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,530
Wind Rider, I see
you met Rainbow Dash!

74
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,912
She's one of our most
promising reserves.

75
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:06,944
She just might
beat your record!

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,256
Really now?

77
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:11,264
Oh, I'm nowhere
near as good as you.

78
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:14,400
I mean I'm fast, but I
don't have the endurance

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,648
to go long distances.

80
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,672
Don't be modest.
A little practice

81
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:20,576
and you'll be beating
records in no time.

82
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:25,120
Heh heh. Well, it's nice
to meet you fillies.

83
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,600
Not as nice as
it is to meet you, sir.

84
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:33,312
I can't believe I
just met Wind Rider!

85
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,584
Yeah. He's coming
out of retirement

86
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,770
to take the spot of honor
in the center of our

87
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,680
aerial flower
formation tomorrow!

88
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:42,528
Really? That's incredible!

89
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:50,320
Guess I'll just watch
Wind Rider being awesome

90
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,536
from the sidelines.

91
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:54,850
Practice tomorrow is
gonna be so boring.

92
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:57,264
I don't suppose I
could keep you company?

93
00:05:58,064 --> 00:05:58,720
You could!

94
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:01,504
They always let friends and
family come watch practices.

95
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:03,008
Oh!

96
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,928
Sorry about that. Let
me help clean that up.

97
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,936
No no. It's almost impossible
to get stains out of silk.

98
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,312
But not to worry...

99
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,184
I've come prepared.

100
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:24,992
That dinner was absolutely
divine! Thanks for inviting me.

101
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,950
Ooh! You're staying
in the east tower?

102
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,550
Those rooms have the
best view of Canterlot.

103
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,120
How lucky are we?

104
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:35,280
Well, we better get some
shuteye before practice.

105
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:37,776
See you tomorrow, Rarity!

106
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:39,184
Good night!

107
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,416
Thanks for keeping
me company, Rarity.

108
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:51,552
If you weren't here...

109
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:54,448
well, I don't know who I'd
be talking to right now.

110
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:57,872
You'd be talking to me.

111
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:01,152
Rainbow Dash, Spitfire's
mom sent a message

112
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:03,840
that she was sick. She had to
leave to take care of her.

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,152
Oh, no! I hope her mom's OK!

114
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:12,160
Me too. In the meantime, we
need you to fly in her place.

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,328
L-l-like in the actual show?

116
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:17,616
Unless Spitfire comes back, yes.

117
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:20,512
I won't let you down, Soarin!

118
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,152
AAAAH! This is the
best thing EVERRR!

119
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,424
Oh, my gosh oh my gosh
oh my gosh oh my gosh!

120
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,440
<i>♪ I'm gonna get to fly with Wind</i>
<i> Rider! And the Wonderbolts! ♪</i>

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,280
<i>♪ Cause I'm the bestest! And I'm</i>
<i> awesome! And they know it! ♪</i>

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,920
Uhhh. Rainbow Dash?

123
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,848
Sh sh. Let her
have this, darling.

124
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,912
Hello, there. Friend or family?

125
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,280
Family. My daughter's
a Wonderbolt.

126
00:07:57,536 --> 00:08:00,512
But I don't see her up
there. Do you know Spitfire?

127
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:04,944
Oh, you're Spitfire's mom?
But I thought you were sick!

128
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:05,910
What?

129
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,648
Well, Spitfire got
a note from you

130
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:08,720
saying you weren't
feeling well

131
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:10,704
and she went home
to take care of you!

132
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,160
I didn't send a note.

133
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,208
That's so strange.

134
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:17,616
Stormy Flare? Aren't you
supposed to be sick?

135
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,024
OK, what's happening?

136
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:23,280
I don't know, but I do know I
didn't send my daughter a note.

137
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:26,496
Could somepony have sent
Spitfire a fake note?

138
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:28,500
Who would do such a thing?

139
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,360
Somepony who wanted her
out of the show, I suppose.

140
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,344
Why would anypony want that?

141
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:36,192
Maybe so that they
could take her spot.

142
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:47,296
Me? I would never
do that to Spitfire.

143
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,024
Why would you think it was me?

144
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:51,984
I did see you and Spitfire
leave the dinner together.

145
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:53,872
We were room neighbors
in the castle!

146
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:57,728
And you did say you would do
anything to fly with Wind Rider!

147
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:00,640
Yeah, but I didn't
mean anything!

148
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,672
Spitfire came by my room

149
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:05,440
and told me she had to go see
her mom at around midnight.

150
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,152
Where were you then?

151
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:11,456
I was asleep at midnight, having
this totally amazing dream.

152
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:14,784
There I was at the arena,
flying with Wind Rider

153
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:17,648
and the Wonderbolts, like
I've always wanted to--

154
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,504
Never mind. Not helping.

155
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,824
Rainbow Dash, if you can prove
that somepony else is behind

156
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:32,528
Spitfire's disappearance
before the start of the show,

157
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,770
then you can still fly with us.

158
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:37,328
In the meantime,
Misty Fly, Blaze,

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,624
head over to Stormy Flare's
house and try to find Spitfire

160
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:41,470
and bring her back.

161
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:45,888
I have to warn you, if
you sent that letter,

162
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:48,992
the bylaws are clear;
I'd have no choice

163
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:52,690
but to ban you from the
Wonderbolts forever. Understand?

164
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:58,192
I understand. But how am I gonna
prove I didn't send a letter

165
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,520
that I didn't send?

166
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,328
With me!

167
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,912
Detective Rarity is on the case!

168
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,296
And we're going to get
to the bottom of this

169
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,940
faster than my
costume change!

170
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:11,248
Yeah, what's
with the get-up?

171
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,528
Obviously, I am
channeling Shadow Spade

172
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,000
through these
gorgeous garments.

173
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,984
And she would say that
the best way to prove

174
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,736
that you didn't send the letter
is to find out whoever did!

175
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,376
First stop, the
scene of the crime!

176
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,488
<i>We had a long road ahead</i>
<i> of us, Rainbow Dash and I.</i>

177
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,880
<i> Well, not too long because</i>
<i> we didn't have much time</i>

178
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,288
<i> but the point is, I was</i>
<i> up for the challenge.</i>

179
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,592
There I was, surveying
the crime scene

180
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,376
and looking tres
chic while doing it.

181
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,480
This must be the envelope
for the letter Spitfire got!

182
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:03,248
Hmm, these look like
hairs from a rainbow mane!

183
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,390
That's not good.

184
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,712
<i>Rainbow Dash was getting antsy.</i>

185
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,840
<i> But I had faith I</i>
<i> could clear her name</i>

186
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,696
<i> and find the real culprit.</i>

187
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:15,664
What are you doing?

188
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:17,744
Huh, oh what? Oh,
just thinking thoughts.

189
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:22,944
<i> Rainbow Dash was right. In</i>
<i> order to solve the mystery,</i>

190
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,840
<i> we had to be focused, driven,</i>
<i> one hundred percent in the--</i>

191
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,008
Ooh!

192
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:31,856
The damask pattern on these
curtains is exquisite!

193
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:35,344
Oh, and this velvet
rope holder, oh it's--

194
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,648
We don't have time
to look at the decor!

195
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:39,600
They're gonna kick me
out of the Wonderbolts

196
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,024
unless we solve this thing!

197
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,392
I know, Rainbow, and
I am on this case

198
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,656
like a charm on a bracelet.

199
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,240
Here's what I'm thinking:

200
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:49,472
somepony had to bring
Spitfire that letter,

201
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:52,912
which means somepony
must have seen them!

202
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,032
I just have a few
questions for you

203
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:01,024
and I'm sure once we get some
things cleared up, we'll--

204
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,520
C'mon, Rarity; we
don't have all day!

205
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,448
Where were you on the night
of last night at midnight?

206
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,512
We were here, guarding
the hallway entrance

207
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:09,424
like we were supposed to.

208
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:11,280
A likely story.

209
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,296
I'm telling you, we
were there all night

210
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:15,840
and no one went in or
out of that hallway.

211
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:18,048
Except for you.

212
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,520
What are you trying to say?

213
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,512
Just that there are only two
rooms in the northwest wing:

214
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:24,140
yours and Spitfire's.

215
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:28,624
So the only other pony who had
access to that wing was you.

216
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,080
<i>The waters were getting choppy.</i>

217
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,680
<i> Rainbow Dash's tactics</i>
<i> were... well, horrid.</i>

218
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:38,096
<i> It was time for</i>
<i> another approach.</i>

219
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:41,056
Perhaps I should
take it from here.

220
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,976
You castle guards have
such a difficult job.

221
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:51,376
I'm guessing that at times,
it can be rather boring.

222
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,000
It is. I've counted all
345 bolts in the ceiling tiles

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,248
293 times.

224
00:12:57,808 --> 00:13:01,310
And of course, being a castle
guard can be thankless work.

225
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm not saying you did,
but if you took a break,

226
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,704
you more than deserved it.

227
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,952
Aw, you're right, we don't
get a lot of recognition

228
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:10,720
for what we do.

229
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
Except for last night when
somepony was nice enough

230
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,890
to leave a cake for us.

231
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:18,090
So we did take one little
break when we ate that cake.

232
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,664
What kind of cake was it?

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,104
Cherry with a
custard filling.

234
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,592
Was the frosting
vanilla or chocolate?

235
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,104
Chocolate.

236
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,136
Was it decorated with
buttercream rosettes?

237
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:25,856
It was!

238
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:28,976
Ugh. Who cares how
it was decorated?

239
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,360
<i> Rainbow Dash was</i>
<i> questioning my methods,</i>

240
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:33,248
<i> but I knew what I was doing.</i>

241
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:34,128
Do you?

242
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:37,910
Oh. Did I say that
one out loud?

243
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:40,980
I mean, even I think I'm
guilty at this point.

244
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,424
I really did want
to fly in that show!

245
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:45,552
What if I wrote that
note when I was asleep?

246
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,624
Do you know what I do when I
sleep? Because I sure don't!

247
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:52,544
Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

248
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:54,896
There's only one
bakery in Canterlot

249
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,056
that makes a chocolate cherry
cake with custard filling

250
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:59,296
and buttercream frosting
rosettes, and that's...

251
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,512
...Cinnamon Chai's
Tea and Cake Shop!

252
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,940
Hello, how can I help you?

253
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:08,512
I've heard you have the best
chocolate cherry custard cake

254
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,592
with buttercream frosting
rosettes in town!

255
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,184
Oh! You travel in
the right circles.

256
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:16,032
We have the only chocolate
cherry custard cake

257
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:18,496
with buttercream frosting
rosettes in town.

258
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,936
Oh, no! But somepony's
already bought it.

259
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
Who was the lucky pony?

260
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:26,992
I can't even say!

261
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,904
Why? Because it was
somepony famous?

262
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,656
No! Because it
was hard to tell.

263
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:37,168
She was wearing a trenchcoat,
sunglasses, and a scarf

264
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,696
around her head that
covered most of her face.

265
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:44,000
But I do remember she had a
really deep, raspy voice.

266
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,224
What do
you mean raspy?

267
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:48,800
Well, kinda like yours.

268
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,448
If there's anything else
you can remember, dish!

269
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,600
Well, have I got
a story for you!

270
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,824
The pony who bought the
cake threw a big fit

271
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:01,264
when she accidentally got
chocolate ganache on her scarf.

272
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:04,512
That's terrible! What
color was the scarf?

273
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:08,800
White. No, maybe
more of an ivory.

274
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:10,464
You don't say!

275
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:13,792
I can't believe you're talking
fashion at a time like this.

276
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,408
Rainbow, don't panic.
I need you to trust me.

277
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,832
Trust you? You've spent
more time changing clothes

278
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,664
than trying to help
me. I'm doomed!

279
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,608
No, you're not. Come on!

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,336
<i>Rainbow Dash was obviously upset</i>
<i>but I had all my ducks in a row,</i>

281
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,160
<i> except for one.</i>

282
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:45,920
<i> She was not going to like it,</i>
<i> but there was only one way</i>

283
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,720
<i> to find out if my</i>
<i> suspicions were correct.</i>

284
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,704
We looked everywhere,

285
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,816
but Spitfire wasn't
at her mom's house.

286
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,016
Where could she be?

287
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,272
I've found the culprit!

288
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:08,928
Somepony sent Spitfire away and
framed Rainbow Dash for it.

289
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,800
And that pony was none
other than... WIND RIDER!

290
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:24,176
Rarity, I can't believe you
would accuse Wind Rider

291
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:25,040
of framing me.

292
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:27,840
He's a living legend,
for pony's sake!

293
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,336
All the evidence points to him.

294
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,440
What evidence could
you possibly have?

295
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,512
All you did was ask
about cake, admire decor,

296
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,608
and change outfits
a gazillion times.

297
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:39,632
Let me explain.

298
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:42,432
I never believed you
would send Spitfire away.

299
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,744
And when we found the rainbow
hairs in Spitfire's room,

300
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:49,584
I could tell they didn't
fall out; they were cut!

301
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:53,264
No pony loses hair in a chunk.

302
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,272
And look at the ends;
it's a straight line!

303
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,384
They were clearly
cut with shears!

304
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,640
Which means somepony planted it.

305
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,584
Then, when we were examining
Spitfire's room...

306
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:08,032
...I smelled something on the
envelope. Juniper Phoenix!

307
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,260
Wind Rider's cologne of choice.

308
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,944
Then, in the castle hallway,
I noticed some of the damask

309
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:17,104
curtains fell out of
their velvet rope holder,

310
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:20,544
indicating that somepony had
been hiding behind them,

311
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,472
perhaps after they dropped
off the fake letter.

312
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,224
Juniper Phoenix is a
very popular fragrance

313
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,544
and anypony could have
moved those curtains.

314
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,920
Precisely why I questioned
the castle guards.

315
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:34,400
They were at their post at
the entrance to the hallway

316
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,632
all night except for
a small window of time

317
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,760
when somepony brought them cake.

318
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,816
A cake that was ordered by a
girl pony with a raspy voice.

319
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,344
Whoever ordered the cake
got a chocolate stain

320
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:51,280
on their ivory scarf, and
I couldn't help but notice

321
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:54,128
Wind Rider's scarf is tied
in a tight Windsor knot

322
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:56,464
instead of its usual
loose slipknot.

323
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,744
And why is that? Is it to
hide... the chocolate stain?

324
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,632
This is preposterous.

325
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:08,640
Wonderbolts, you don't
believe a word of this, right?

326
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:12,416
Just admit it! You're as
guilty of framing Rainbow Dash

327
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,608
as you are of ruining
that ivory scarf!

328
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,352
Fine. You caught me! I did it.

329
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,800
But why, Wind Rider?

330
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,848
Is it because I took
the last broccoli

331
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:25,500
at the dinner and you
really really wanted it?

332
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,528
No. It was because he was afraid

333
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:31,856
that you would break his long
distance Wonderbolt record.

334
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,112
I heard him when Spitfire said

335
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,664
you were close to
breaking his record.

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,400
He said and I quote, "heh heh."

337
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,152
That's the polite but
disingenuous laugh you make

338
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,520
when you want to seem happy
but really you're not.

339
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:45,872
I thought if I could
get Rainbow Dash

340
00:18:45,872 --> 00:18:47,552
kicked out of the
Wonderbolts forever,

341
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,690
my record would be preserved.

342
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:53,160
Really? That is so not cool.

343
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
I thought you were the coolest
Wonderbolt ever until now.

344
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,616
I did what I had to do
to protect my record.

345
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,272
Sometimes, you gotta play
dirty to be the best.

346
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,752
That's not what being a
Wonderbolt is all about.

347
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:06,048
She's right!

348
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,240
Wonderbolts look
out for each other.

349
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:11,360
Which reminds me,
where is Spitfire?

350
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,176
I sent her the letter
pretending to be Stormy Flare.

351
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,944
I told her I had Pegasitus
and the only cure

352
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:19,360
is the Ice Iris in
the Crystal Mountains.

353
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:21,664
No wonder she's
been gone so long.

354
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,848
Ice Irises are almost
impossible to find in spring!

355
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,096
The Crystal Mountains are too
far for anypony to make it there

356
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,968
and back before the
Royal Garden opening.

357
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:33,830
Rainbow Dash, we need you
to fly in Spitfire's place.

358
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,632
But Spitfire shouldn't have to
miss this. I'm gonna get her.

359
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:39,360
Well, you'll never
make it in time!

360
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,936
Then there's no time to lose!

361
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:48,576
Rainbow Dash is still gone!

362
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:49,472
Oh, don't panic.

363
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:52,368
If I know Rainbow Dash,
she'll come through.

364
00:19:57,536 --> 00:20:00,496
Spitfire, you're back! I
can't believe you made it!

365
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:04,272
Oh, I wouldn't have, if Rainbow
hadn't found me so fast.

366
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:06,336
Gave me enough time to fly back!

367
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,168
Rare, I couldn't have
done it without you.

368
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:11,168
And I'm sorry
I doubted you.

369
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,600
But why didn't you tell
me what you were doing?

370
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:16,032
Well, I didn't want to get your
hopes up until I was sure.

371
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,864
And I couldn't be sure until
I saw that chocolate stain.

372
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:20,610
Thank you for believing in me...

373
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:24,704
...even when I was doubting
you. I'm some friend, huh?

374
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,880
Actually, you're
quite a good friend.

375
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,224
You went to get Spitfire,

376
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,320
even though it meant
you couldn't fly today.

377
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:33,340
I'll get
my chance one day.

378
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:37,536
Or today. How'd you like Wind
Rider's spot in the show?

379
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:41,300
What? You can't
do this to me.

380
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,288
I'm one of the greatest
Wonderbolts there ever was!

381
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:47,856
Not anymore. For attempting
to frame Rainbow Dash,

382
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:51,152
I hereby strip you of
your Wonderbolt status!

383
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,208
So would you like
to fly with us?

384
00:20:56,864 --> 00:21:00,390
Would I? Woo-hoo!
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

385
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,328
Uh-huh, Uh-huh!
Yeah! Oh, YEAH!

386
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,940
Uh, Rainbow Dash?

387
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,224
Coming!

388
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:15,280
<i>So my friend got</i>
<i> her moment in the sun.</i>

389
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:18,256
<i> Or the center of an aerial</i>
<i> flower as the case may be.</i>

390
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,952
<i> And as for me? I got a</i>
<i> chance to show off my</i>

391
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:23,696
<i>Femme Mystique Chic collection!</i>

392
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,136
That's nice, dear.

393
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,904
Oh. Did I say
that out loud?
