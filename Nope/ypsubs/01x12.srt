1
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:17,591
Let's quiet down, please. We have
a very important lesson to get to.

2
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:19,856
Thank you.

3
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:22,682
Today, we are going to be
talking about cutie marks.

4
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:25,063
Boring.

5
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:27,564
You can all see my cutie mark, can't you?

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,411
Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark.

7
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:33,683
My flank was blank.

8
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:37,270
Awww, the's tho prethious!

9
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,751
Then one day, when I was about you age...

10
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:42,845
...I woke up to find that a
cutie mark had appeared!

11
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,986
Look at her hair!

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,383
Yes, I know. But honestly, that's how
everypony was wearing their mane back then.

13
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:53,777
I had decided to become a teacher.

14
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:58,226
And the flowers symbolized my hope that
I could help my future students bloom...

15
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:00,091
...if I nurtured them with knowledge.

16
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:05,190
The smiles represented the cheer I hoped to bring
to my little ponies while they were learning.

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,267
Now, can anyone tell me when
a pony gets his or her cutie mark?

18
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:10,888
Oh, oh, oh!

19
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:15,141
When the dithcovers that thertain
thomething that maketh her thpecial.

20
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,787
That's right, Twist.

21
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:19,409
A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank...

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,242
...when he or she finds that certain something...

23
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:24,792
...that makes them different
from every other pony.

24
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,676
Discovering what makes you unique isn't
something that happens overnight.

25
00:01:28,677 --> 00:01:34,133
And no amount of hoping, wishing or begging
will make a cutie mark appear before it's time.

26
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:37,094
What?

27
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,567
Apple Bloom!

28
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,325
Are you passing a note?

29
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:50,813
What could be so important that it
couldn't wait until after class?

30
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,327
It's blank!

31
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,184
Reminds you of anypony?

32
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,971
Want thome thweet? I've got thome peppermint thticks.

33
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:55,003
I made them mythelf.

34
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,319
They'll make you thmile!

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,593
No...

36
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:04,008
I don't know why we had to sit through
a lecture about getting a cutie mark.

37
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:07,631
I mean, waiting for your
cutie mark is so last week.

38
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:09,270
You've got yours...

39
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:10,742
...I just got mine.

40
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,640
We all have them already.

41
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,445
I mean, almost all of us have them already.

42
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:21,325
Don't worry, you two. You're still totally
invited to my cuteceañera this weekend.

43
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,687
It's going to be amazing.

44
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:27,341
It's a party celebrating me
and my fantastic cutie mark.

45
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,992
How could it not be?

46
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,410
<i>Bump, bump
sugar lump rump!</i>

47
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:34,967
Gimme a break.

48
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:37,062
See you this weekend...!

49
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:40,981
Blank Flanks!

50
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,608
It's not fair! It's just not fair!

51
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,600
Oh, don't get your mane in a tangle.

52
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:54,089
You'll get your cutie mark.
Everypony gets one eventually.

53
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:58,920
But I don't want one "eventually".
I want one right now!

54
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:03,587
I can't go to Diamond Tiara's
cuteceañera without one. I just can't!

55
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:05,107
'course you can!

56
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:10,748
You know, I was the last pony in my class to get
a cutie mark. And I couldn't be prouder of it.

57
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:15,906
I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres
and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.

58
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:20,315
Come to think of it, Granny Smith
was the last one in her class too.

59
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,760
Same with Big Macintosh.

60
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,859
I really don't see how that's
supposed to make me feel better.

61
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,289
That probably means that being the last one in
your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family.

62
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:32,587
Runs in the family...?

63
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,556
Runs in the family!

64
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,310
RUNS IN THE FAMILY!

65
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,470
You've got apples for your cutie mark...

66
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,283
Granny Smith has an apple pie...

67
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:42,554
Big Macintosh has an apple half...

68
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:45,502
My unique talent must have
someth'n to do with apples!

69
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,024
Apples! Apples! Apples!

70
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,988
Apples.

71
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:58,864
Get you delicious, nutritious apples here!

72
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:03,301
Delicious and nutritious! And so many uses!

73
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:05,565
You can eat 'em...

74
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:07,259
Play with them...

75
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:11,425
Hey, watch it!

76
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,881
Create fine art for your home with them...

77
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,666
You have to be crazy not to get
a bushel of your very own.

78
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,724
She's so creative...!

79
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:23,719
You, sir!

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,051
Care about some apples?

81
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:26,294
Uh... no thanks.

82
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:27,766
Why not?

83
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:29,296
I have plenty at home.

84
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:30,904
Are you sure?

85
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:31,789
Yes, I'm pretty sure...

86
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,511
You're *pretty* sure.

87
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:37,216
But You're not absolutely, positively
completely super-duper sure. Are you?

88
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,656
Uh... if I buy some apples,
will you please leave me alone?

89
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:41,768
Awright!

90
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,508
You forgot your change!

91
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:51,680
That's how you sell some
apples and get a cutie mark.

92
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:54,508
So, what does my cutie mark look like?

93
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:58,169
A shoppin' bag full of apples?
A satisfied customer eatin' an apple?

94
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,837
Maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first.

95
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:07,203
You touch it, you buy it!
We take cash or credit.

96
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:09,042
I'm sorry, ma'am...

97
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,373
Ma'am!

98
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,924
Now, Apple Bloom, you can't just...

99
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:16,625
That'll be four bits.

100
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,650
I didn't put those in my bag!

101
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,147
Likely story... Four bits, lady!

102
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,384
Apple Bloom!

103
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:25,528
I am really, really sorry about that. She's new.

104
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:28,713
Here, take these. No charge.

105
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:31,616
And these.

106
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,930
And these.

107
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:39,929
Ya'll come back, now, ya hear?

108
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,965
What?

109
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:47,125
Sorry, little sis, but your
applesellin' days are over.

110
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:50,688
What?! But how else am I
gonna get my cutie mark?

111
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,592
Home! Now!

112
00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:00,441
Listen, sugar cube. I know it's hard
to wait for your very own cutie mark.

113
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:02,527
But you just can't force it.

114
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,237
Besides, your not that grown up just yet.

115
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:08,018
Ain't there other fillies
in your class without one?

116
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:11,049
Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.

117
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:14,013
Do you think it'd feel better
if you went to the party with her?

118
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,412
Well, there you go!

119
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:19,204
Bet you and Twist will have
a great time together.

120
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:21,404
Now run along and find your friend.

121
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,621
You're sure you don't want me to stick
around till the end of the market?

122
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,607
Hey! Who's been using my racket?!

123
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,920
Yeah. I'm sure.

124
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,362
Oh. What'th up, Apple Bloom?

125
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:39,907
So I was thinkin'.

126
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:43,147
Maybe we could go to Diamond
Tiara's cuteceañera together?

127
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,888
I don't have a cutie mark, you
don't have a cutie mark...

128
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,313
Well, um...

129
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,756
Ithn't my cutie mark thwell?

130
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:57,403
I've alwayth loved making
my own favorite thweets...

131
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:01,474
...but it took me thome time to dithcover
that it wath my thuper thpecial talent.

132
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,675
Pretty thweet, huh?

133
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:07,723
Yeah... Pretty... sweet.

134
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:12,822
Hey... This doethn't mean we can't
go to the cutetheañera together.

135
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:15,687
You're thtill gonna come to the party, aren't you?

136
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:17,363
Of course she will.

137
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:21,875
It's not like being the only pony there
without a cutie mark would be, like...

138
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,348
...the most embarrassing thing ever.

139
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:32,814
Whoa...

140
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:36,310
Looks like somepony's got a dark
cloud hanging over her head.

141
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:38,847
Let me do something about that.

142
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,763
What's the matter, kid?

143
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:48,715
Theresacuteceañerathisafternoonandeverypony

146
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,379
I WANT IT NOW!

147
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:03,987
Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that.

148
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:06,430
Applejack says these things take time.

149
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,859
I have to just wait for it to happen.

150
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:12,462
Why wait for something to happen
when you can make it happen?

151
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:14,326
But Applejack says...

152
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:16,046
Hey, who are you gonna listen to?

153
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,382
Applejack...

154
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:20,527
...or the pony who was first in
her class to get a cutie mark?

155
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:24,125
I always liked flying n' all but
I was going nowhere in a hurry.

156
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:28,074
It wasn't until my very first race that
I discovered a serious need for speed.

157
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:29,487
And KAZAM!

158
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:32,386
This sweet baby appeared as fast as a lighting.

159
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,866
That's right!

160
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:42,012
Stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose.

161
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:46,147
The key here is to try as many things
as possible as quickly as possible.

162
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,358
One of them is bound to
lead to your cutie mark.

163
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,524
Are you ready?

164
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:50,679
I'm ready!

165
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:51,709
I said...

166
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,179
ARE YOU READY?!

167
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,929
I'M READY!

168
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,136
Jugglers, go!

169
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,811
Hang gliding, go!

170
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,626
Karate, go!

171
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:24,061
Kite flying, go!

172
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:45,416
Ultra-Pony Roller Derby, go!

173
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:06,501
Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...

174
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:09,894
Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party.

175
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:13,153
I know. It totally shows off my new cutie mark.

176
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:14,697
I love being special.

177
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:18,787
Can you imagine how embarrassing
it must be to be... not special?

178
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:21,807
I don't even want to, like, think about it.

179
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,244
Tried that one... Huh, tried that one...

180
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:29,569
I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find somethin' I'm good at.

181
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:32,790
You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.

182
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,803
Eatin' cupcakes?

183
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:36,611
Eating cupcakes?

184
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,668
Eating cupcakes!

185
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:42,375
I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash.

186
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:45,139
You're really great coach and
I've learned a lot from you...

187
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,450
...and I'm sure I can learn a lot more, but...

188
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:49,743
I've got some cupcakes to eat!

189
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:51,968
See you at the cuteceañera!

190
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,719
Hold on, Pinkie Pie! I'm comin'!

191
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:58,265
I can't believe I didn't think of this.

192
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:02,023
A cupcake eatin' cutie mark. It's so obvious!

193
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:06,251
Now, where are those cupcakes?
I'm ready to chow down!

194
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:08,116
I don't have any cupcakes.

195
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,237
Oh.

196
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,456
But you look like you'd be good
at helping me make some!

197
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:17,277
I guess, uh, "makin' cupcakes"
cutie mark could work too.

198
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,316
<i>All you have to do is take a cup of flour,
add it to the mix.</i>

199
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:25,323
<i>Now just take a little something sweet, not sour.
A bit of salt, just a pinch.</i>

200
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,320
<i>Baking these treats is such a cinch,
add a teaspoon of vanilla.</i>

201
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:33,146
<i>Add a little more and you count to four
and you never get your fill of...!</i>

202
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,191
<i>Cupcakes, so sweet and tasty!</i>

203
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:36,925
<i>Cupcakes, don't be too hasty!</i>

204
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,521
<i>Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, cupcakes!</i>

205
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,223
Hot! Hot! Hot!

206
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:56,972
Those look much better than the last batch.

207
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:06,609
Guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either.

208
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:11,256
I just have to face it.
I'm gonna have a blank flank forever.

209
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,077
What about that?

210
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:14,587
What about what?

211
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:18,176
Is there someth'n on my flank?
Is there, is there, is there?

212
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:23,114
A cutie mark! It's up!

213
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,413
A... a measuring cup? No.

214
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:27,402
A mixin' bawl? No.

215
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:28,950
Are those cupcakes?

216
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:31,912
A tower of cupcakes, maybe?

217
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,404
Flour! It's flour!

218
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:38,427
Yay! I guessed it! What game
do you wanna play next?

219
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:40,284
Please say bingo, please say bingo...

220
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:43,238
Whoa...! What's been going on in here?

221
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,598
We've been making cupcakes. Wanna try one?

222
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:48,598
No, thank you. Not that they don't look...

223
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:51,331
...delicious.

224
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,861
Twilight! You have to help me!

225
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:54,714
What's the matter?

226
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:59,143

231
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,690
I don't follow.

232
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,202
How can I help you?

233
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,280
You can use your magic to
make my cutie mark appear.

234
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,907
Oh no, Apple Bloom.

235
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:23,755
A cutie mark is something that
a pony has to discover for herself.

236
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:26,177
Please, Twilight. Just try.

237
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:27,191
I'm sorry, but...

238
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:29,453
Oh please, please, please, please, pleeeaaase!

239
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:30,463
Alright, alright.

240
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,193
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

241
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,234
Yes! I knew you could do...

242
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,664
...it.

243
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:41,514
I'm sorry, sweetie. But I told you...

244
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:43,256
Try again! Try again!

245
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:03,095
Told you that not even magic can make
a cutie mark appear before it's time.

246
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,939
It's hopeless. Hopeless!

247
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:09,944
I just won't go to the party. I can't go!

248
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,888
Everyone will just laugh at me and
make fun of me and call me names.

249
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,888
It'll be the worst time of my life.

250
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:18,587
I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.

251
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,757
Forget it. There's no way I'm going to that...

252
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:26,602
...party.

253
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,425
How could I've forgotten the time?

254
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:43,471
How could I've forgotten
Pinkie Pie was hostin' the party?

255
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:46,197
How could I've forgotten
it was at Sugarcube Corner?

256
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:47,816
Don't forget you party hat...

257
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,549
...Forgetty Forgetterson.

258
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:54,382
I have to get out of here
before anypony sees me.

259
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,038
Hey!

260
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:03,287
It's my cuteceañera.

261
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,682
I'm supposed to get the first bite of cake.

262
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:30,709
Okay, Apple Bloom. Almost there...

263
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,746
Apple Bloom! You made it!

264
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:50,594
After I heard about Twist, I was
afraid you wouldn't show up.

265
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:53,947
I sure am glad you came to your senses
about this all cutie mark thing.

266
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,830
These things happen when these
things are supposed to happen.

267
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,357
Tryin' to rush it will just drive you crazy.

268
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:02,344
I'll let you be. Looks like your
friends want to talk to you.

269
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,785
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

270
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:15,677
Nice outfit.

271
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:18,871
Just someth'n I, uh, pulled together last minute.

272
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,004
It really shows off your cutie mark.

273
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:24,103
Oh, wait. That's right. You don't have one.

274
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:25,807
I have a cutie mark.

275
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:27,731
What? Since when?

276
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:30,476
Since, um... earlier today.

277
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:32,982
Oh really? Let's see it.

278
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:37,017
I shouldn't. I couldn't.

279
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:40,147
My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing.

280
00:17:40,148 --> 00:17:42,316
I'm afraid that if I showed it off...

281
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:45,338
...everyone would start paying
attention to me instead of you.

282
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,464
Outshined at your own cuteceañera?

283
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,639
Can you imagine how
embarrassing that would be?

284
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:54,778
Uh, forget it.
I didn't really want to see it anyway.

285
00:17:54,944 --> 00:17:57,353
Okay! Well, I'm gonna go mingle.

286
00:17:57,354 --> 00:17:58,772
Enjoy your party!

287
00:18:09,886 --> 00:18:11,006
Oh no!

288
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,583
Wow, that IS an amazing cutie mark.

289
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:18,359
Nice try...

290
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,013
Blank Flank!

291
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:26,257
You got a problem with blank flanks?

292
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:31,021
I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?

293
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:34,870
The problem is, I mean, she's,
like, totally not special.

294
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,805
No, it means she's full of potential.

295
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,887
It means she can be great at anything.

296
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,958
The possibilities are...

297
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,865
..."like, endless".

298
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:45,840
She could be a great scientist...

299
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,636
...or a amazing artist...

300
00:18:47,637 --> 00:18:49,237
...or a famous writer.

301
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,200
She could even be
mayor of Ponyville some day!

302
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:55,468
And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.

303
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,988
Hey! This is MY party,
why are you two on HER side?

304
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,407
Because...

305
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,147
You don't have your cutie marks either?!

306
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,071
I thought I was the only one!

307
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:10,367
We thought we were the only two.

308
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,969
I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.

309
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,041
Lucky? How can they be lucky?

310
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:21,197
They still get to experience
the thrill of discovering who they are...

311
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:22,679
...and what they're meant to be.

312
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:26,082
And they've got all the time
in the world to figure it out.

313
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,178
Not just an afternoon.

314
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:33,720
-Wow, Apple Bloom.
-Do you really think you can be a mayor?
-I wish I could be a scientist.

315
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:36,741
Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon?

316
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:38,733
Hey, what's everypony doing?

317
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:43,055
This is my party, everypony's supposed
to be paying attention to me!

318
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:47,579
Whatever. We still think you're
losers. Right, Diamond Tiara?

319
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:51,142
-<i>Bump, bump, sugar lump...</i>
-Not now, Silver Spoon.

320
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,379
Name's Scootaloo.

321
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,847
And I'm Sweetie Belle.

322
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,334
Apple Bloom.

323
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:04,961
This thong is tho thuper!

324
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,445
So I was thinkin'. Now that we're friends...

325
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,048
I mean, we are friends, right?

326
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:17,799
How could we not be? We're totally alike.

327
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,188
We don't have cutie marks...

328
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:22,182
Diamond Tiara and Silver
Spoon drive us crazy...

329
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:23,752
Totally crazy!

330
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:27,605
Now that we're friends...

331
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,045
...what if the three of us work together to find
out who we are and what we're supposed to be?

332
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:35,861
We could form our own secret society.

333
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm liking this idea!

334
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:40,524
A secret society! Yeah.

335
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,300
We need a name for it though.

336
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:45,471
The Cutie Mark Three?

337
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,711
The Cutastically Fantastics?

338
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:50,158
How about...

339
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,739
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

340
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,723
It's perfect!

341
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:56,517
-This is gonna be so great!
-We're gonna be unstoppable!

342
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:59,708
What do you say we celebrate
with some of these delicious cupcakes?

343
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,045
Not the cupcakes! Trust me.

344
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,281
Let's see if there are any cookies!

345
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,888
-Yeah!
-Come on!

346
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,814
"Dearest Princess Celestia."

347
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,928
"I am happy to report that
one of your youngest subjects..."

348
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:14,715
"...has learned a valuable
lesson about friendship."

349
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:19,228
"Sometimes the thing you think will cause
you to lose friends and feel left out..."

350
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:23,189
"...can actually be the thing that
helps you make your closest friends..."

351
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,747
"...and realize how special you are."

352
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:33,466
