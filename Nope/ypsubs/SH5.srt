1
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,480
Come on, Rarity! You simply must
get this piano to band practice!

2
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,820
What kind of person
doesn't put a piano on wheels?

3
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,820
Just look at me.
I'm a mess.

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,870
What I need is
a bit more muscle.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,700
Oh, boys!

6
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,960
I simply cannot thank you enough.

7
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,670
And while I am a bit repulsed
by your musky smell,

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,470
I can appreciate that
you're all diamonds in the rough.

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,560
Excuse me!
Pardon me! Excuse me!

10
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,060
Thank you!

11
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,150
Where is Rarity?!

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,570
That gal probably just wants
to make some sort of grand entrance.

13
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,320
Tada!

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,700
- Told ya.
- Rarity,

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,240
couldn't you have chosen
a more portable instrument?

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,450
Heavens, no! The grand piano is
the most refined and elegant of instruments.

17
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,080
With it, I will be able
to express my full musicality.

18
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,130
Well, our time's up. I guess
we'll have to move our practice to the gym.

19
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,970
Guess you're gonna express
your "full musicality" clear across campus.

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,180
Huh? Awww...

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,180
Or you could play this!

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,680
It's part guitar, part keyboard!
It's a guitarkey!

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,890
You mean a keytar.

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,110
Po-tay-to,
to-mah-to.

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,320
Oh, my!

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,540
Well, look at that!

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
- Wowee!
- Oh, my goodness!

28
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,210
Well, then,
how about ya take that keytar

29
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,380
and move your tail
to our next rehearsal space?

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,890
Fine, fine.
I don't suppose...
