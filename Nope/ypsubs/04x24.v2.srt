1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,270
This just got real.

2
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,500
Listen up, gang.

3
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,110
We're almost there so I've
got a few things to say.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,800
First off, who here besides
me thinks this is the best

5
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,760
Equestria Games delegation
in Ponyville history?

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,610
And no matter what
your sport is,

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,980
we've gotta give it our best

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,290
because we've all got a genuine
shot at Ponyville gold!

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,680
With the possible
exception of Bulk Biceps,

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,270
Fluttershy and me.

11
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,900
I mean, we're good and all, but
we're up against the Wonderbolts

12
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,030
in the aerial relay, so
gold's kind of a stretch.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,260
Let's not kid ourselves.

14
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,030
Don't feel bad, Rainbow Dash.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,770
We have absolutely no shot
at winning gold, either!

16
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,790
Uh, that's because you're
carrying the flag for Ponyville

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,060
in the opening ceremony.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,120
There are no winners.

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,830
Winners or not, we still have
the chance to be awesome!

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,180
That's the spirit.

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,540
You hear that, everypony?

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,460
Winners or not, we all still
have the chance to be awesome!

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,120
But uh, let's
still try to win

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,830
lots and lots of stuff too, OK?

25
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,370

26
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,100
Phew! It's all in there, gang.

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,360
Leave it to Spike,
champion gear carrier,

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,180
for all your
gear-carrying needs.

29
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,700
And the Ponyville flag?
You sure?

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,990
And what about the flagpole?

31
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,450
In with the portable ramp.

32
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,590
<i>Whoa!</i>

33
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,430
Give it a rest,
Applebloom.

34
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,400
Aw she's just nervous,
that's all.

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,580
Perfectly understandable.

36
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,370
Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget
something and I start to panic,

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,940
I have a simple
trick: I count to ten,

38
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,360
and by the time I'm done,
I've calmed myself enough

39
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,360
to get the job done
right every time.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,630
Easy peasy cider squeezy.

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>Hey!</i>

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,450
Put me down!

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,730
What's going on?

44
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,200
Spike! Are you
all right?

45
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,770
A thousand pardons, O
Great and Honorable Spike

46
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,170
the Brave and Glorious.

47
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,110
Huh? Who the what now?

48
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,080
Thanks for bringing
Spike to us.

49
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,220
It's OK, Spike.

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,710
We'll have our hoofponies
go back for your bags.

51
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,410
Can they hang back a sec and
tell me what's going on first?

52
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,280
Mm mm!

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,610
So the ponies here think
I'm some kind of hero, huh?

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
More of the green ones, please.

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,410
I like the green ones.

56
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,240
<i>Last time you were here,</i>

57
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,290
you got the Crystal Heart
to Princess Cadance

58
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,260
in time to save this entire
empire from destruction.

59
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,520
You are known
throughout my empire

60
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,760
as Great and Honorable
Spike the Brave and Glorious.

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,100
Isn't that awesome?

62
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,070
You're a big shot here, Spike.

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,940
See that?

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,100
<i>That's you!</i>

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,970
Hello, gorgeous.

66
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,890
This is why we all hope
you'd do us the honor

67
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,400
of lighting the torch at
the opening ceremony.

68
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,500
You'd be the very
first dragon

69
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,600
in the history of the
Equestria Games to do so.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,290
Of course, I'll do it!

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,870
And bonus: I can do it
with my fire breath.

72
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,390
Places for the
procession, everypony.

73
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,720
Two minutes!

74
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,440
And you're quite certain

75
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,360
you also understand exactly what
you're supposed to do?

76
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,110
I stand where you tell me
until you give me the signal.

77
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,990
And then I walk over
and light the torch.

78
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,250
Mm. Couldn't be simpler.

79
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,240
Mr. The Dragon? Are you coming?

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,210
Honestly.

81
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,360
Would somepony help him walk?

82
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,050
Now please welcome the
delegation from Ponyville!

83
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,110
Ponyville forever! YAY!

84
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,610
Awesome!

85
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,480
yay

86
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,070
Yeah!

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,910
Whoo hoo!

88
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,130
This is the signal.

89
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm giving you the signal now.

90
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,520
Mr. The Dragon!

91
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,400
Come on, Spike.

92
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,540
Calm yourself.

93
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,650
Count to ten.

94
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,810
One, two, three, thousand,
fourteen thousand,

95
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,470
twenty thousand,
thirty thousand!

96
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,110
What's wrong?

97
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,360
Tell me this isn't happening.

98
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,690
Equestria, we
have a problem.

99
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,660
Mr. The Dragon, would you
light the torch already?

100
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,770
I don't know what it is, but I
just don't have the stuff today.

101
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,100
Did you bring a match?

102
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,050
You're a fire-breathing dragon.

103
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,980
Then some cough drops, maybe?

104
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,460
Never mind.

105
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,640
I'll keep trying.

106
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,250
Somepony go down and help him!

107
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,980
Light! Light!

108
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,600
Phew!

109
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,250
How did you do that?

110
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,130
I'm...not sure.

111
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,040
Ah well, better
late than never.

112
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,750
Let the Games begin!

113
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,600
Oh! There are our
little superstars!

114
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,950
You were fabulous!

115
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,840
Made me sit up proud like
a cornstalk in August.

116
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,010
Ya done good, squirt.

117
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,850
You three
really were wonderful.

118
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,460
But does anypony know what
was going on with Spike?

119
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,120
He sure seemed to be havin'
a tough time of it out there.

120
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,320
He put things right
in time, though.

121
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,040
Actually, it was me.

122
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,140
I didn't want him
to be embarrassed,

123
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,790
so I cast a secret spell
to light it for him.

124
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,380
Oh dear. Have you
told him?

125
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,040
No, but he might have
figured it out on his own.

126
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,210
You gotta tell him just in case.

127
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,990
I know. I'm just afraid
of how he'll take it.

128
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,290
I know what pride he
takes in a job well done.

129
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,820
Psst. Here he
comes now.

130
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,470
Act casual.

131
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,250
'Sup.

132
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,210
Spike! Is everything OK?

133
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,330
I guess. I don't know!

134
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,200
The weirdest thing
happened down there.

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah, about that. I--

136
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,570
I mean, there I was,
trying to light the torch,

137
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,110
with all of Equestria watching,

138
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,410
and feeling like the
hugest failure ever.

139
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,280
And then the thing just
lit. It was amazing!

140
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,470
Oh! Phew! I was afraid
you'd be upset.

141
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,130
Upset? Are you kidding? Why
would I be upset to discover

142
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,330
I can light fire with my mind?

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,780
Huh?

144
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,760
Look! It's the Great
and Honorable Spike

145
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,940
the Brave and Glorious!

146
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,320
Can we get your autograph?

147
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,560
Sure!

148
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,940
How you saved our empire
last time you were here

149
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,490
was really amazing.

150
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,920
Aw. You know what
else is amazing?

151
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,440
Watch this!

152
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,600
Don't worry. Once it bursts
into flames through brainpower,

153
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,520
I'll sign another one
for you. Promise.

154
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,100
Spike, may I have
a word with you a moment?

155
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,100
Better be careful with that.
Might burst into flames later.

156
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,420
Delayed reaction.

157
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,800
Hey Twi, what is it?

158
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,720
Hold on, hold on!
Give me a second.

159
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,310
If I can set fire to
stuff with my mind,

160
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,710
mindreading must be
just around the corner,

161
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,850
and I predict that you
are about to ask me

162
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,580
to set fire to something
with my mind!

163
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,570
No. Because you can't.

164
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh really? So how do you explain
what happened down there

165
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,240
in front of thousands
and thousands--

166
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,520
I did it, Spike. I cast a
spell to do it for you.

167
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,470
... in front of thousands
and thousands...

168
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,300
I'm sorry, Spike.

169
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,820
I just couldn't stand to
see you stuck like that.

170
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,010
You understand, don't you?

171
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,410
I, uh...I need to be
alone right now.

172
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,960
Spike?

173
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,100
O Great and Honorable Spike
the Brave and Glorious.

174
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,030
Can I get your autograph?

175
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,560
Sorry. You should probably
ask somebody special instead.

176
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,440
<i>Our next event:</i>
<i>the aerial relay!</i>

177
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,780
That's Dash and Fluttershy!

178
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,530
Oh no, we can't
be late for that!

179
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,880
Miss, step right over here.

180
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,620
<i>Unicorns will no</i>
<i>longer be admitted</i>

181
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,050
<i>without a disabling spell.</i>

182
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,730
To prevent cheating.

183
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,770
And make sure you don't
even try casting a spell

184
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,810
<i>or we'll know it.</i>

185
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,930
Hmph!

186
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,520
If Ponyville medals here
we'll have 8 medals so far,

187
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,750
putting us tied for the
lead with Cloudsdale.

188
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,680
Unless Cloudsdale
medals here, too.

189
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,220
Ms. Harshwhinny, I know
you're really busy but--

190
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,710
What is it?

191
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,810
Maybe there's something else I
can do for the Games, you know,

192
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,090
something really worthy of the
Crystal Empire's admiration?

193
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,420
What are you talking about?

194
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,570
You lit the torch
for the whole thing!

195
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,880
Well, actually, that
wasn't really--

196
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,120
That wasn't "worthy"
enough for you?

197
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,010
For ponies' sake!

198
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,190
Next thing you know, you'll be
asking to put on a rock concert!

199
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,560
Agh! Celebrities.

200
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,110
Wait. That's it!

201
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,930
Second place!

202
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,270
We got silver!

203
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,450
Congratulations to
all our medalists.

204
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,540
And now, the anthem of--

205
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,790
And I shall do the
honor of singing!

206
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,890
Spike? What are
you doing?

207
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,150
You know how they always
just play the music?

208
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,430
Well, I know all the
words to our anthem

209
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,390
and will sing them for you
now, loud and proud,

210
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,130
<i>to the enjoyment of all!</i>

211
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:54,950
And now, um, the Cloudsdale
anthem, as sung by Spike.

212
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,450
Wait, the Cloudsdale anthem?

213
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,310
They only play the anthem
for the winners, Spike.

214
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,220
The Wonderbolts are
from Cloudsdale!

215
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,460
But I don't know the words
to the Cloudsdale anthem.

216
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,110
I've never even heard it!

217
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,970
<i>Sing for us, O Great</i>
<i>and Honorable Spike</i>

218
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,590
<i>the Brave and Glorious!</i>

219
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,230

243
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,090
Spike, you coming?

244
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,210
Nah, I got this
stuff to pack up.

245
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,700
But you've been moping in here
for almost the entire Games.

246
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,790
And tonight's the
closing ceremony.

247
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,360
Which means we leave tomorrow.
Ergo the packing.

248
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
And so the Games conclude
as they always do

249
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,320
with the Ice Archery finals.

250
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,320
<i>Ice archers, take your places!</i>

251
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,190
Too bad Ponyville doesn't have
any ice archers competing.

252
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,040
We don't have
anyone to root for.

253
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:15,870
It's OK.

254
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,860
Ponyville has 37 medals
and Cloudsdale 36,

255
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,750
so looks like we'll be medal
champs of the Games anyway!

256
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,670
Whoo hoo!

257
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,290
But Cloudsdale has two
ice archery finalists

258
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,490
down there right now.

259
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
<i>If they both place, Cloudsdale</i>
<i>wins the medal count.</i>

260
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,120
So you're saying it all
comes down to this one event?

261
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,380
Pretty much.

262
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,790
<i>Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!</i>
<i>Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!</i>

263
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,910
Twilight! Come take this
extra seat next to me

264
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,620
and freak out over
the medal count.

265
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,710
I'll show you how.

266
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,810
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

267
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,800
Actually I was
looking for Spike.

268
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,800
Have you seen him?

269
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,960
He wouldn't come.

270
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,580
We tried to talk him into it.

271
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,090
But he wouldn't listen.

272
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,960
You can have his
extra seat, though.

273
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,930
Uh...Twi?

274
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,860
<i>Spike? You here?</i>

275
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,530
Uh, yeah. I'm super busy.

276
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,940
Look at all this
packing left to do.

277
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,990
Crazy, right?

278
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,980
No more hiding out.
You're coming with me.

279
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,120
Now.

280
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,790
OK, fine. I'll come. Can
I at least wear these?

281
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,270
Those aren't your
average arrows.

282
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,830
<i>They freeze whatever part</i>
<i>of the target they hit.</i>

283
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,730
<i>Whoever encases their entire</i>
<i>target in ice first wins.</i>

284
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,980
<i>Keep your eye on</i>
<i>Number 7 from Cloudsdale.</i>

285
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,460
<i>He's the favorite.</i>

286
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,960
Honestly Spike, I don't
see why you're being

287
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,100
so hard on yourself.

288
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,030
I let everypony down. Twice!

289
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,880
You never let anypony down

290
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,520
so you have no idea
what that's like.

291
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,250
Are you kidding? I've
totally let ponies down.

292
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,530
That's not the point.

293
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,000
The torch got lit; the aerial
relay teams got their medals.

294
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,370
No harm no foul.

295
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,120
Can we at least watch
from inside there?

296
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm not sure I'm ready to face
crowds in the stands just yet.

297
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,450
NO!

298
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,130
Steer it towards the field!

299
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,720
Away from the crowds!

300
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,030
Somepony cut the
disabling spell!

301
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,400
There isn't time!

302
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,060
Dash! Fluttershy! MOVE!

303
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,620
That was awesome!

304
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,910
I just wanted to
thank you personally

305
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,520
for saving those ponies,
and the Games,

306
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,670
O Great and Honorable Spike
the Brave and Glorious.

307
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,690
You must be very proud.

308
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,800
I guess.

309
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,400
You guess?

310
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,940
I just saw what needed
to be done and reacted.

311
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,160
It just so happens
I can breathe fire.

312
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,610
If any of you could do that,
you'd have done the same.

313
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,600
Forgive me for
being blunt, Spike,

314
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,760
but you're not makin'
a lick of sense.

315
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,870
It's just how I feel.

316
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,600
Wait a second. I
think I get it.

317
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,760
You keep saying you
let everypony down.

318
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,610
But we all keep
saying you didn't.

319
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,850
You know who was disappointed
in you, Spike? You.

320
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,630
And only you can make
it right with you again.

321
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,490
<i>What would that take, Spike?</i>

322
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,290
I don't know. Can
you turn back time?

323
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,770
Cause I'd sure like a do-over
on that opening ceremony.

324
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,800
We can't turn back time.

325
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,060
But would you do me
the great honor

326
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,080
<i>of lighting fireworks</i>
<i>in my place</i>

327
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,930
<i>at the closing</i>
<i>ceremonies tonight?</i>

328
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,320
Come on, Spike.

329
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,890
You've saved the
Crystal Empire. Twice.

330
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,460
I think you can
light some fireworks.

331
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,340
I guess I have to at
least give it a shot.

332
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,080
We did it!

333
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,060
Ponyville won the medal count!

334
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,030
And only by one medal.

335
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,560
Hmm. Wonder which
medal that was?

336
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,690
Bam!

337
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,260
How's it feel to have opened
the best Equestria Games

338
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,770
in Ponyville history, Squirt?

339
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,300
Probably as good as it
feels to close them.

340
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,400
OK, it's time.

341
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,940
<i>You know, it's kinda weird;</i>

342
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,470
no matter how many times others
<i>tell you you're great,</i>

343
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,570
<i>all the praise in</i>
<i>the world means nothing</i>

344
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,080
<i>if you don't feel it inside.</i>

345
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,890
<i>Sometimes, to feel</i>
<i>good about yourself,</i>

346
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,490
<i>you've got to let</i>
<i>go of the past.</i>

347
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,770
<i>That way, when the time comes</i>
<i>to let your greatness fly,</i>

348
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,280
<i>you'll be able to</i>
<i>light up the whole sky.</i>
