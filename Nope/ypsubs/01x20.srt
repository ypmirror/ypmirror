1
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:06,092
So sorry, Fluttershy.

2
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:08,508
I hate being late for our weekly get-together.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,622
The usual!

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,989
But you will NOT BELIEVE what happened to me.

5
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:16,620
Is everything all right?

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,310
Oh, it's much more than all right.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,721
I was on my way here,
wearing my latest hat creation...

8
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,213
...when who should stop me on the street?

9
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,053
But Photo Finish!

10
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:27,622
Photo Finish?

11
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:32,825
She is the most famous fashion
photographer in all of Equestria.

12
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:40,293
Anywho, she saw my hat and said
it was absolutely marvelous!

13
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,467
What a lovely compliment.

14
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:45,961
She was so impressed that she wants
to take some pictures of my shop...

15
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,107
...featuring some of my clothes!

16
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:51,340
That's wonderful.

17
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:56,753
Do you know what this could
mean for my fashion career?

18
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,509
Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,916
But I'm going to need somepony
fabulous to model for me.

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,163
Somepony with beauty.
Somepony with grace. Somepony...

21
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:09,495
...like you!

22
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:12,047
Oh, goodness. I don't know.

23
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:14,770
Oh, this is such a huge opportunity.

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,276
And it would mean so much to me.

25
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:19,082
I'm flattered, really.

26
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:22,088
Nopony is going to have
your elegance and poise.

27
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:23,666
-But...
-Nopony!

28
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,817
-There has to be somepony more quali...
-Please!

29
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:27,545
-Somepony more into fashion.
-Please!

30
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:31,707
-Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight
-Please, please, PLEEEASE!

31
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:37,779
Oh, if it's that important to you,
of course I'll do it.

32
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:40,109
Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!

33
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:42,680
You are the best friend a pony could ever have!

34
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:48,308
What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.

35
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,142
Isn't it?

36
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,254
Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree
to model for me that I felt completely frazzled.

37
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:55,706
I think I feel a pimple coming on.

38
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,484
Oh! Only one solution!

39
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,092
The usual!

40
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:41,638
Hm... She's going to want to
see attitude and pizzazz.

41
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:44,932
A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.

42
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,655
More light! It has to catch
the sequins just so...

43
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:49,565
...or the whole outfit is just a disaster.

44
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:54,510
Oh, and the headdress need more feathers.
Pinkie Pie! More feathers!

45
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:03,471
And sequins! More sequins!

46
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:11,290
And more ribbon!

47
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,056
Oh no! Less ribbon.

48
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,191
No! More ribbon.

49
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:23,190
Oh, this hem is completely off.
PINCUSHION!

50
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,536
Thank you all for helping me.

51
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:35,058
I'm sorry to be so short with you,
but I'm... I'm just so nervous.

52
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,897
Ooh, doesn't that hurt?

53
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,535
Thick scales. Can't feel a thing.

54
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,340
And even if I could...

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,387
...there is no pain that would
keep me from assisting...

56
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:49,074
...the most beautiful creature in the world.

57
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:54,279
I'm gonna tell you two a secret.
But you have to promise not to tell anyone.

58
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,598
I promise.

59
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,676
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my eye.

60
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,298
I have a crush on Rarity!

61
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,135
We won't say a word!

62
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:15,847
Give me a break. Everypony
already knows how you...

63
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:18,313
Twilight! You promised Spike
you wouldn't say anything.

64
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:22,575
He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust
is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!

65
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:25,655
-But...
-FOREVER!

66
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,778
My lips are sealed.

67
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,865
Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is
gonna pick up on your feelings.

68
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,793
I, Photo Finish...

69
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,842
...have awwived.

70
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:41,854
Let me just say...

71
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:43,036
What an honor!

72
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,329
We begin...

73
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:48,392
...NOW!

74
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,565
Attitude and pizzazz!

75
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:57,790
Yes! Show Photo Finish something.

76
00:04:58,716 --> 00:04:59,575
No!

77
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,028
Yeees.

78
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:06,666
No!

79
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:08,929
Yeees.

80
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:14,125
No!

81
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,144
Yeees.

82
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,534
ENOUGH!

83
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,397
She hardly took any pictures.

84
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:33,057
I'm so sorry. I tried my best.

85
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:36,540
Well, the headdress is too big for you
and cape had too much sparkle.

86
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:39,399
I can't believe I ever thought
*I* could impress *her*.

87
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,714
It seems that I, Photo Finish...

88
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,360
...have found a next fashion star
here in Ponyville.

89
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:45,624
Really?

90
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:46,966
Yes. Really.

91
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:49,256
And I, Photo Finish...

92
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:53,829
...am going to help her
to shine all over Eqvestria.

93
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,213
Tomorrow a photo shoot in ze park.

94
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:00,880
I go!

95
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,197
Did you hear that?

96
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,315
I am going to "shine all over Equestria".

97
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:10,708
Oh, Rarity. I was so worried
I'd ruined everything.

98
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,852
Oh, never. I knew you'd be perfect.

99
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,204
No, no, no, yes!

100
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:37,125
That is definitely the one.
Photo Finish is going to love it.

101
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,436
Everypony is going to love it!

102
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:42,222
Oh, I am so excited for you.

103
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:47,281
Just don't forget us little ponies when you become
the most famous designer in all of Equestria.

104
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,468
Never.

105
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:49,886
Put me down here.

106
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:57,923
Oh, nonononononono.

107
00:06:57,923 --> 00:07:00,021
The model should be in something simple!

108
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,398
Something inspired by...

109
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:04,262
...the nature!

110
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,021
That's just what I was thinking.

111
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:13,226
Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh,
put a little something together.

112
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:15,566
Yes... that will not be necessary.

113
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:18,127
But... but... how are you going to help me...

114
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,294
..."shine across Equestria"...

115
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:23,056
...if I don't design something
new for these pictures?

116
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:26,169
I am not going to help you
shine across Equestria.

117
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:29,324
I am going to help *her* shine.

118
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,679
She is my star.

119
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:33,214
You! Go!

120
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:44,270
I can't, Rarity.

121
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,824
Oh, but you must, Fluttershy.

122
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:48,317
Photo Finish wants to make you a star.

123
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:50,782
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

124
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:54,076
I know we were both hoping
it would be my lifetime...

125
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:56,503
...but nonetheless you can't
throw away this chance.

126
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,111
You must do this for me.

127
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,333
You must. You must! YOU MUST!

128
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:02,628
Floottershy!

129
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,410
It is time to make...

130
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,158
...the magics!

131
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,023
Oh, wunderbar!

132
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:14,929
You are like a delicate flower.

133
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,036
So much more alluring without
all those sparkles und feathers.

134
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:26,152
How'd it go? How'd it go?

135
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:27,888
It didn't.

136
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,192
Photo Finish wanted to work
with Fluttershy, not me.

137
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:35,174
Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry.

138
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,705
Is there anything we can do?

139
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:40,543
I just vant to be alone right now.

140
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:46,017
You heard her. She vants to be... alone.

141
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:52,710
What? I didn't think she meant *alone* alone.

142
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:05,317
Too much blush.

143
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,074
Not enuf.

144
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:10,538
Too much.

145
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:12,685
Not enuf.

146
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:16,202
Perfiect.

147
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,312
Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are gressful.

148
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:26,385
NOW GO!

149
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:32,725
How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed?
Frilled beyond your wildest dreams?

150
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,769
N... nervous.

151
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,562
Nervous? Dun be ridiculous.

152
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:38,393
You're only facing a large crowd of ponies...

153
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:41,131
...who will be watching your every move
and silently judging you.

154
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,085
Your cue! Now go!

155
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,306
You can't let Rarity down.

156
00:09:56,406 --> 00:10:00,635
You must do this. You must. You must. You must.

157
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:12,347
-So graceful.
-So lovely.

158
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:15,101
So perfect for my new advertisement.

159
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,025
It's Fluttershy!

160
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,119
Wow. Look how popular you are.

161
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:25,575
I'm so excited for you.

162
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:28,231
You must be having the best time ever.

163
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:32,475
Oh, yes. Best time ever...

164
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,040
Flootershy! I have been
looking for you everywhere.

165
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,872
We have the thing at the place.

166
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:40,738
I'll see you at the spa. Our usual time?

167
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:44,645
Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the...

168
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,222
..."thing" at the place.

169
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:53,746
I'm the one who should be
mobbed by strangers wherever I go.

170
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,566
Welcome to Carousel Boutique!

171
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,711
Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.

172
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:02,574
Sorry. You just missed her.

173
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:07,506
But you're still in luck. I'm having
a huge sale of some of my best designs.

174
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,035
And you are...?

175
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,861
Rarity, of course.

176
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:13,197
Never heard of you.

177
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:24,674
Obviously I, Photo Finish,
am fwilled to have found her.

178
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:25,990
Photo Finish?

179
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:28,809
-She's a natural in front of the camera.
-Um...

180
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:30,391
Photo Finish?

181
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:33,263
I only need to point
and shoot and I capture...

182
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:34,538
...the magics!

183
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:40,414
Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
It's just that I'm running late.

184
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:42,772
How could I have forgotten?!

185
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,915
Your appearance at the ballet opening!

186
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:47,678
Everypony who is anypony will be there.

187
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,822
Oh, actually I'm supposed
to be meeting my friend...

188
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:51,479
WE GO!

189
00:12:56,381 --> 00:13:00,375
My hooves are getting positively pruney,
I've been waiting here so long.

190
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:07,085
Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her
new *career* to spend time with her best friend.

191
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:09,519
I'm sure she just got tied up.

192
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,019
Of course she did.
She's a big bright shining star!

193
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,660
I wish that star would burn out.

194
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:18,541
Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.

195
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,109
I know, I know.

196
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,759
And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just...

197
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:23,940
...jealous!

198
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:26,406
Oh, please promise you won't
tell her I feel this way.

199
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,520
Please, please, pleasepleasePLEASE!

200
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:30,933
You have my word.

201
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,801
Losing a friend's trust is
the fastest way to lose a friend.

202
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,719
FOREVER!

203
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,421
Wow! You look great!

204
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,606
Fluttershy may be the one who's famous...

205
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:48,634
...but that doesn't mean
I have to stop looking fabulous.

206
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,277
Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm...

207
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,563
Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?

208
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,158
Sorry.

209
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:03,741
Oh, I can't believe this.

210
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:06,753
I am so frustrated I could just scream.

211
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:13,425
Feel better?

212
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:15,864
No.

213
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,339
-Can I tell you something?
-Of course.

214
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,552
You promise not to tell Rarity?

215
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:22,822
I swear.

216
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,076
Pinkie Pie-swear?

217
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,486
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my AARGH!

218
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:32,280
I don't like being a model.

219
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,374
No, I hate being a model.

220
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,560
All this attention is awful, just awful.

221
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,606
And I'm only doing it because Rarity
told me I must. I must! I MUST!

222
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:44,348
I must...

223
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:46,558
Oh, really?

224
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,056
Well...

225
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,122
If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...

226
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,079
Oh, what were you about to say?

227
00:14:58,542 --> 00:14:59,917
FOREVER!

228
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:02,244
Nothing!

229
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:07,849
I was just thinking.

230
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:11,405
If you really don't like being a model,
you could always quit.

231
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:14,223
Oh, no. I could never do such a thing.

232
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:16,309
Rarity would be devastated.

233
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:17,603
But Rarity told me...

234
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,624
Mmm... Juicy!

235
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:35,903
Oh, if only all these ponies
didn't like me so much.

236
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,200
Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore.

237
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,100
She'd find somepony else with...

238
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:41,496
...the magic!

239
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:42,946
I guess you're right.

240
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,357
You're right.

241
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:47,185
You're right, you're fight, you're right!

242
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:49,771
It's Fluttershy!

243
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:58,775
Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy
could never do something unattractive.

244
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:02,613
But if I used my magic to help her do something
unattractive on her next fashion show...

245
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,835
...no one would ever want her to model again.

246
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:09,332
And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model,
Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her.

247
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,696
And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets!

248
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,118
It's the perfect plan!

249
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:14,735
You can't tell anyone about it.

250
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,011
Promise me you won't tell anyone?

251
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:29,175
S-s-so you do promise or you don't?

252
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:30,549
Uh, yes!

253
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:31,935
Obviously, that's why I...

254
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:34,051
Zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key...

255
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:36,165
...then dug a hole, then buried the key...

256
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:38,209
...then built a house up top the hole
where I buried the key...

257
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,938
...then moved into the house atop the hole.

258
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:41,962
Obviously.

259
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,277
You really think it'll work?

260
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:54,157
They love you for being you.

261
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:56,576
So all I have to do is make you *not* be you.

262
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:57,909
Just leave it to me.

263
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:09,886
Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.

264
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:50,333
Oh no.

265
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:55,709
Get her off the stage!

266
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:58,279
She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!

267
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,535
I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!

268
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:06,246
Bravo!

269
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,701
I say bravo!

270
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:12,451
Bravo? Who could possibly say
bravo to that horrid display?

271
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:15,065
Such attitude! Such pizzazz!

272
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:18,126
She's invented an entirely
new kind of modeling! Bravo!

273
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:20,122
Who is saying these things?

274
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,890
It's her.

275
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,445
The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress.

276
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,803
Now that is a pony, who clearly
knows a thing or two about fashion.

277
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:32,060
Well, if that fabulous pony likes it...

278
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,860
...then I do too! Bravo!

279
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:50,072
This is awful. Just awful!

280
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:52,674
Somehow I've become more popular than ever.

281
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,854
Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!

282
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:02,471
If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.

283
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:04,123
But Rarity...!

284
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:08,249
Fluttershy! Are you all right?

285
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:12,886
I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model.

286
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,782
Why wouldn't I be great?

287
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:15,845
Because you ha...!

288
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:20,597
Out there on the runway,
everyone was turning on you and...

289
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:24,102
Oh... oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful.

290
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:25,834
I wanted them to.

291
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:27,292
You did?!

292
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,330
Of course she did! Because...!

293
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:32,572
I'm jealous!

294
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,830
I wanted all the attention.
And instead it was going to you.

295
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,947
I even started hoping that you would do something
silly so your modeling career would be over.

296
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:44,059
But then, when it started happening,
all I could think was...

297
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:47,709
...how could I want you to fail
at something you love so much?

298
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:50,307
But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!

299
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:55,946
Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.

300
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:56,857
You do?

301
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:58,323
More than anything.

302
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,308
Then why did you keep doing it?

303
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:04,100
I was afraid if I quit, you'd be
mad at me for not wanting to...

304
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,233
..."shine all over Equestria".

305
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:10,442
And I thought if I told you how jealous I was
of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.

306
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,610
Never!

307
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,331
All this time!

308
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:15,681
If we just told each other the truth.

309
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,839
I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.

310
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,789
Me too.

311
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:23,383
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my eye.

312
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:27,194
You were brilliant. Brilliant!

313
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:30,810
I've already got six photo shoots
lined up for tomorrow aloon.

314
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:35,494
I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think
I'll be able to make any of them.

315
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:37,127
Wat?

316
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:38,426
We go!

317
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,502
Vat has just happened?

318
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:46,321
Spike has a crush on Rarity!

319
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:50,804
And you were doing so well.

320
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:55,276
Now this is a wonderful way
to spend an afternoon.

321
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:56,820
Isn't it, though?

322
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,962
"Dear Princess Celestia."

323
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:01,927
"Being a good friend means
being able to keep a secret."

324
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,849
"But you should never be afraid to
share your true feelings with a good friend."

325
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,767
Did you get all that, Spike?

326
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,705
No. I did not.

327
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:13,583
I still can't believe you told someone
about my secret feelings for Rarity.

328
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:17,881
You're right. That was
wrong of me and I'm very sorry.

329
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:19,784
Apology accepted.

330
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:22,844
Now will you take down
my letter to Princess Celestia?

331
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:24,052
I would love to.

332
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:27,268
But... I'm a little busy at the moment.

333
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:34,603
