1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,684
There you go, Mr. Mousey.

2
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,717
Now you stay off that leg
and do everything I told you.

3
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:16,556
And it will be just like new in no time at all.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,612
Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help.

5
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:29,259
You... found a watch?

6
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:33,322
You... wanna be a watch?

7
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:37,130
You're running!

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,337
Running out of time?

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,313
No. You're... late?

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,977
I'm late for a very important date!

11
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:56,871
The big brunch for Princess Celestia
at Sugarcube Corner.

12
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,607
Oh, the Princess is here
in Ponyville for a party...

13
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:05,536
...and we all promised we'd be there.
But I'm not there!

14
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:06,866
Oh, do I look all right?

15
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:07,910
Do I need to bring anything?

16
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:08,937
Maybe I shouldn't go?

17
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,370
It's starting! I'm missing it!

18
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:17,084
Oh, thanks, Angel.

19
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,759
I mean, if you hadn't reminded me,
I might have not remembered and then...

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,569
...then I wouldn't be there and everypony
would be wondering where I was and...

21
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,311
Oh, right. I'm late.

22
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,303
Oh, okay then. See you later.

23
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:27,104
So... what do I have to do to get to be
one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway?

24
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,032
Is the pay good?

25
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:34,645
Hellooo! Anybody home?

26
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:48,852
Ooh, you're good.

27
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:51,718
Too good. I'm bored.

28
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:55,815
Made it.

29
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:59,278
-Halt!
-Who goes there?

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,216
No one. Never mind. I'll go home.

31
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:07,083
It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.

32
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:09,515
Thanks, Twilight.

33
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:11,874
I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy.

34
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,739
It wouldn't be the same without you.

35
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:24,480
How's everypony doing? Good? Good.

36
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,237
Anything else we can get for you, dearies...?

37
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:30,391
Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests.

38
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:33,789
Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

39
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:37,866
Sorry I'm late. I had to finish
taking care of a patient first.

40
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:40,877
Oh, you and your Tender Loving Care of little animals.

41
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:43,780
I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you.

42
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:46,813
I mean, I hope she will...
I mean, of course she will!

43
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:51,306
Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one
who got nervous at social gatherings.

44
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:55,171
Oh, it's not that. I just want the Princess
to approve of my friends.

45
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:57,115
But she's met us all before.

46
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:58,653
And read about you in my letters.

47
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,130
But this is the first time she spent any real time with you.

48
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:03,064
I want everypony to make a good impression.

49
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:05,953
Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.

50
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,611
Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?

51
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:09,838
Don't touch me!

52
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:13,509
Watch the dress!
Careful, you're gonna spill that on me!

53
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:17,462
Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it?

54
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:20,059
Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!

55
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,628
Or... perhaps not that casual.

56
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:28,425
Uh... which is the salad
and which is the appetizer again?

57
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:30,468
And which am I supposed to eat first?

58
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:39,438
Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.

59
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:43,733
It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect.

60
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,802
I doubt the Princess will even notice.

61
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:49,440
Cookies, candies and pies! Oh my!

62
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:54,467
Chocolate Fountainy goodness!

63
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:02,037
You gonna eat that?!

64
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:08,634
Hey!

65
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,376
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

66
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:14,472
That's quite all right, thank you.

67
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,243
Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!

68
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:22,751
Uh, I see it, honey bun!

69
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:24,873
Oh, um... thank you.

70
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:27,084
Not at all, Your Highness.

71
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,609
Thank you again.

72
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,404
Oh, but of course, Your Majesty.

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,748
Gotcha!

74
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:43,697
And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?

75
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:46,221
Me? Oh yes, Your Highness.

76
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,220
I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters...

77
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,029
...that you enjoy tending
to the needs of woodland creatures.

78
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,369
Yes, I love to take care of animals.

79
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,132
As do I. As princess, I care deeply
about all creatures, great and small.

80
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:05,081
Nothing means more to me
than the well-being of all my subjects.

81
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:10,910
Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake.

82
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,221
Do say hello to our gracious hosts.

83
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:20,309
Oh... my.

84
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,783
She is quite a sight, isn't she?

85
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:27,667
I... I... I've never seen anything like it.

86
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:36,072
Really? Well, if I must...

87
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:39,880
I'm sorry, everypony.
I'm afraid I have to cut the party short.

88
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:43,314
The mayor has requested an audience with me.

89
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:47,196
Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time.

90
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:49,599
It's been a joy getting to know you all better.

91
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,541
Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved!

92
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:15,642
Stay right where you are.
All I want is a clear path to the exit.

93
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,494
NOBODY MOVE and my dress won't get hurt!

94
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:20,343
Stay back! Back, I say!

95
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:26,985
Well, Spike...

96
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,985
I don't know for sure
how things went with the Princess...

97
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:33,272
...but at least no big disasters happened.

98
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:41,683
Oh, you poor little thing.

99
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:43,946
How did you ever get in such bad condition?

100
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,963
Don't you worry, Philomena.
I'll nurse you back to health.

101
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:52,896
As a favor to the Princess, who's obviously
just far too busy to care for you properly.

102
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,456
I'm sure the Princess will appreciate the help.

103
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:07,610
Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away.

104
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:10,604
There.

105
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:46,118
This is far worse than I thought.
What you need is some medicine. Stat!

106
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,056
Here you go, Philomena.
This will fix you right up.

107
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,942
Doctor Fluttershy expected that.

108
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:06,941
Always works.

109
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,083
Uh... Almost always.

110
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:21,605
There's nothing like home-made soup
to cure what ails you.

111
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,431
Come on now. You're not gonna get better
if you don't cooperate.

112
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,953
Mmm... See? It's delicious.

113
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:32,680
Good and good for you.

114
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,698
Here come the choo-choo train.

115
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:38,864
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!

116
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:49,958
Oh dear.

117
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,497
Don't worry, Philomena.
I know what'll make you feel better.

118
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:54,853
Wait right here. I have just the thing.

119
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:02,420
Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow
feathered friend by to cheer you up.

120
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:07,144
Hummingway here was sick once too,
but he let me help him and got better in no time.

121
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:08,547
Didn't you, boy?

122
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:13,113
Say hello to your new friend Philomena.

123
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,884
Aw, look. I think he likes you.

124
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:27,042
Your turn now, Philomena.

125
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,010
Go ahead. You can do it.

126
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:38,496
Um... good try?

127
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,119
I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat.

128
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,684
A humidifier.

129
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:50,733
Refreshing.

130
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,744
How's that feeling now for you,
Philomena? Better?

131
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:03,690
Oh...

132
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:07,154
That's okay.

133
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:09,524
I know lots of other ways to take care of you.

134
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,591
Don't worry. You're gonna get better.

135
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:12,726
How about...

136
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:16,485
Aromatherapy?

137
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:26,691
Warm bath?

138
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,517
Ointment?

139
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:41,385
Scalpel.

140
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:43,961
Surgical tape.

141
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,339
Feathers.

142
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:57,046
Oh, Philomena.

143
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:59,377
I thought it would be easy
to nurse you back to health.

144
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:01,732
I've tried everything I know.

145
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,849
And look at you. You're worse than ever.

146
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:09,902
Hi, Fluttershy!

147
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,710
I just wanted to drop by and
say thank you so very much...

148
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,154
...for making such a good impression
on the Princess today...

149
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,587
What is Celestia's pet doing here?!

150
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:23,190
I couldn't leave the poor thing there.
She needed my help.

151
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,808
Oh no. NonononononoNO!

152
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,216
This is bad.

153
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:29,138
How could I just walk away and not do anything?

154
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,296
But... but... she doesn't belong to you!

155
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,858
I had to do something.

156
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:36,024
Without telling anypony?!
Without asking permission?!

157
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:36,720
But...

158
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,698
I know you had good intentions...

159
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:42,053
...but you have got to return Princess's pet!

160
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,174
But...

161
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:51,112
You're right.

162
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:52,637
Okay, let's...

163
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:54,820
...go.

164
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,979
If we hurry, we can put her back
before anypony even realizes she's missing.

165
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,038
We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here.

166
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,408
We regret to inform you, miss...

167
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:15,281
...that the royal pet has gone missing.

168
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:18,486
Really? You don't say!

169
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,712
It's that dry night air.

170
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,165
But it's daytime.

171
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:43,266
Well, day air's even drier.

172
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:48,250
You guards better be on your way
if you're gonna find the Princess's missing pet.

173
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,613
Philomena, was it?

174
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:51,744
Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop.

175
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,859
BYE!

176
00:13:59,147 --> 00:13:59,973
What are you doing?!

177
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:02,194
Going to return Philomena, remember?

178
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:03,667
We can't now!

179
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,533
Why not?

180
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:09,762
You have no idea what the Princess is gonna do
if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!

181
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:10,958
Do you?

182
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:13,318
Well... no.

183
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:15,690
But it can't be anything good.

184
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:18,404
She might banish you from Equestria.

185
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:20,172
Or throw you in a dungeon.

186
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:25,869
Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon
in the place that she banishes you to.

187
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:29,143
You really think the Princess would do that?

188
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:32,354
Okay. Granted that probably won't happen...

189
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:34,443
...but do you wanna take any chances?

190
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:38,546
All that really matters to me is that
poor little Philomena here gets well.

191
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:42,147
That's very noble of you.

192
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,887
I'll write to you when you're banished.

193
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,862
Unless I'm banished too
somewhere there's no post office.

194
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:48,855
Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?

195
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:52,419
Please, Twilight. You just have to
help me get Philomena healthy...

196
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,303
...and then we can return her to the Princess.

197
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:56,508
And everything will be fine.

198
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:59,449
Did you give her any kind of medicine?

199
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,631
I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.

200
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:04,609
Then you have to MAKE her take it.

201
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,941
You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy!

202
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,106
You need to show this patient who's the boss.

203
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,360
Make her straighten up and fly right!

204
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,085
She can't fly.

205
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,812
No excuses!

206
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:20,033
Done. Okay, what else?

207
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,037
Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off.

208
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:25,997
The ones that haven't fallen out yet
from all her coughing, I mean.

209
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,786
There you go.

210
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,665
I don't think she likes it.

211
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,853
Tough love, baby.

212
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,714
You want her to get well, don't you?

213
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:38,734
-Of course, but...
-NEXT!

214
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,412
Well, she desperately needs some bed rest...

215
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:43,496
...but I can't get her to stay put.

216
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:47,813
One step ahead of you.

217
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,410
It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise.

218
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:55,514
Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.

219
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:58,483
What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.

220
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:02,099
I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.

221
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,155
Oh, she'll eat it, all right.

222
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:10,846
Hey! Where are you going?

223
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,077
No! Philomena! Come back!

224
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,414
What are you two doing?
Are you having a race?

225
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,155
Oh, can I play? 123GO!

226
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,973
-Excuse me!
-Hi!

227
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:26,576
Beg your pardon!

228
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:27,714
Put me down!

229
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,664
What in tarnation?!

230
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:32,339
-Sorry, but we've gotta find...
-The Princess's pet bird!

231
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:36,234
Philomena! Come down from there!

232
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:37,502
You'll hurt yourself!

233
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:50,752
I'll catch you!

234
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:09,067
What is going on here?

235
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:12,478
Twilight.

236
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:14,965
Yes, Your Majesty?

237
00:18:15,614 --> 00:18:17,529
There's been a terrible accident.

238
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:20,224
It's all my fault.

239
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,003
No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better.

240
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:24,439
It was my fault.

241
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,315
-I'm the one who did it.
-But you were only trying to help.

242
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,790
Some help I was.

243
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,893
Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.

244
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,590
But it's my fault!

245
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:34,890
No, it's my fault!

246
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,307
No! It's my fault!

247
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,424
Wait. What are we talking about?

248
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,581
Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but...

249
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:44,542
Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird.

250
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:47,158
I really was only trying to help the poor little thing.

251
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,813
Then I was gonna bring it back to you, honest.

252
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,469
So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me
in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to...

253
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,406
...then that's what I deserve.

254
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:06,961
Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena.

255
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,667
You're scaring everypony.

256
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:22,001
I don't understand!

257
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,504
What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?

258
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:28,305
This is Philomena.

259
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:30,197
She's quite a sight, as I said.

260
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:32,514
But nothing unusual for a phoenix.

261
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:33,873
Isn't that right, Philomena?

262
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:38,069
A... A phoenix?

263
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,102
A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird.

264
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:43,681
While it appears healthy and happy
most of the time...

265
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,310
...every so often it must renew itself by shedding
all of its feathers and bursting into flame.

266
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,782
Rather melodramatic, if you ask me.

267
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:56,481
It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy.

268
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:59,131
All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix.

269
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,813
I'm afraid, mischievous little Philomena here...

270
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:04,353
...took the occasion to have
a little fun with you, Fluttershy.

271
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,344
Say you're sorry, young lady.

272
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,736
So... aren't you gonna banish me?
Or throw me in a dungeon?

273
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:13,754
Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon
in the place that you banish me to?

274
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,138
Of course not, my little pony.

275
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,878
Where on Earth would you get such an idea?

276
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:21,936
I guess I have some imagination.

277
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:25,968
Fluttershy really did do everything she could
to try to take care of Philomena for you.

278
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:29,194
And I do appreciate that your heart
was in the right place, child.

279
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:32,469
But all you had to do was ask me and
I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix...

280
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,132
...and saved you all this trouble.

281
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,233
I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.

282
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:40,544
Next time I'll ask before
taking matters into my own hooves.

283
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,643
Should I write you a letter
about that lesson, Princess?

284
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:47,908
No, that's quite all right.
I think I can remember.

285
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,523
It's beautiful.

286
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:59,237
Thank you, Philomena.

287
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:01,115
No hard feelings.

288
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:20,805
Yes!

289
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:33,209
