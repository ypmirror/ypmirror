1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,021
Tea?

2
00:00:07,956 --> 00:00:10,123
Trendy coats,
bedrolls, saddlebags?

3
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,987
Ooooh! A surprise vacation
just for the two of us?

4
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:15,384
How thoughtful!

5
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:19,587
I hear Puerto Caballo is
lovely this time of year.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,104
Sand like powdered sugar.

7
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,375
Um, Princess
Celestia is taking us

8
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,064
on an overnight goodwill
tour of Yakyakistan.

9
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:30,412
I just found out.

10
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:37,489
So what you're saying is
no tea? Oh well, that's fine.

11
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:39,329
I wasn't thirsty anyway.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,236
If you're looking
for something to do,

13
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:48,073
you could spend the evening
with Spike and Big Mac.

14
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:53,046
Ha.

15
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:55,101
You aren't kidding.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,046
They're very nice. They have
a "Top Secret" thing they do

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,473
whenever we leave
Ponyville,

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,627
although everypony
knows about it,

19
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,313
so it's not a
very good secret.

20
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:06,240
I think you'd
have fun with them.

21
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:08,707
"Fun?" With sidekicks?

22
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:10,596
Oh, you must think that
we're in a dimension

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,033
where everything
is opposite.

24
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:17,760
Da dee la! I'm Opposite Discord

25
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,412
and I want to hang out
with Spike and Big Mac!

26
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:23,070
I'm sure I'd have fun.

27
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:25,200
WELL GUESS WHAT, SASSAFRAS!

28
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:28,480
I'M OPPOSITE FLUTTERSHY
AND I'M SICK OF BEING NICE

29
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:30,449
AND QUIET ALL THE TIME!

30
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:34,252
Let me explain it to
you as simply as I can.

31
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,830
Me? Amazing. Them? Well,
I've already forgotten

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,910
who we're talking
about. You see?

33
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:43,944
All I'm saying is
it's an opportunity

34
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:46,344
to expand your
circle of friends.

35
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:50,492
Unless you're afraid
they won't like you.

36
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:55,593
Oh please, don't stoop to
tedious reverse psychology.

37
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,366
You're better than that.

38
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:00,073
It never hurts to
make new friends.

39
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:03,649
Hmph. Consider
it considered.

40
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:09,975
Couldn't I just come
with you instead?

41
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:22,600

https://yp1.yayponies.no/

42
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:55,827
I suppose this is
goodbye, then.

43
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,452
Have an absolutely
fabulous voyage.

44
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:03,963
Discord.

45
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:07,046
Well, it's not my fault
the new train route

46
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:10,855
leads into an active volcano.
Guess you'll have to stay.

47
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:14,769
Oh, you're no fun.

48
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:18,713
I got my bedroll, parka,

49
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,843
unattractive but
functional hikin' boots.

50
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:22,978
Uh, anything I
forgot, Pinkie Pie?

51
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:25,366
You're our resident
Yakyakistan expert.

52
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,827
Nope! I brought
Yeti food.

53
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,344
Did I forget to mention
there's a pony-eating Yeti

54
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:35,784
on Frostfield Glacier? We're
gonna have so much fun!

55
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,526
Ha. If he messes with us, I'll
turn that Yeti into confetti.

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,335
Somepony's in an awful quick
hurry to get us outta here.

57
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,969
Don't y'all have too
much fun without us.

58
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:58,566
I bet you boys have big
plans. Right, Spike?

59
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,689
I'm sure I don't know what
you're talking about.

60
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:04,160
Although if I did, I
certainly wouldn't be

61
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:06,375
allowed to discuss
it with you girls.

62
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:09,218
Bye-bye!

63
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,455
Bye y'all!

64
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,802
Fascinating article, yes?

65
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,329
Don't let them come over,
please don't

66
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:39,370
let them come over,
please, please, please!

67
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,557
Oh! Salutations, my friends!

68
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,527
Wish I could stay and chat,
but... I don't want to.

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,936
Wait! Um, we were wondering...
what are you up to tonight?

70
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:54,465
Here we go.

71
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,317
Do you want to, I
don't know... hang out?

72
00:04:57,543 --> 00:04:59,101
Is that like
something you do?

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,520
Oh, Twilight's friend

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,458
and Applejack's
monosyllabic brother!

75
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:07,167
If only I weren't super
busy this evening.

76
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,214
I guess Guys' Night
will just be you and me.

77
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:14,315
A Guys' Night?

78
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,776
You mean a rowdy evening
of reckless revelry?

79
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,152
Zoot suits, fedoras,
swing dancing?

80
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,392
Eh, something like that.

81
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,571
You should totally come!

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,484
Three of us would be
way better than two.

83
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:30,329
That does sound
fun, actually.

84
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:31,844
Too bad you're busy.

85
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,437
Well, I suppose I
could squeeze you in

86
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:39,181
if I moved a few very
important ponies around.

87
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:43,548
June, honey? Be a dear,
reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay?

88
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,310
That's what I call Princess
Celestia. What a hoot.

89
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:48,037
In fact, clear
the whole evening.

90
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,407
Tonight is Guys' Night.

91
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:51,651
These fellas invited
me to spice things up

92
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,915
and bring a little class
to the whole affair.

93
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,061
Tonight will be the best
night of your lives.

94
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:01,590
And not just because you
get to bask in my greatness.

95
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,320
I do love basking in
things. See you tonight!

96
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:07,938
Twilight's castle. The fun
starts promptly at sundown.

97
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,541
Technically the fun
starts when I arrive,

98
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:14,461
but I'll make sure it's
around sunset. Adieu, fellas.

99
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,769
And... we have sundown.
Repeat: we have sundown.

100
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:29,072
I declare tonight's
GUYS' NIGHT ceremonies

101
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:32,160
officially... OPEN!

102
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,310
EEYUP!

103
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:38,447
It's Guys' Night aw yeah
havin' fun now, aw yeah.

104
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:42,616
What the hay?

105
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:53,360
Announcing the
much-anticipated arrival

106
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,345
of the Spirit of
Chaos and Disharmony,

107
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:58,785
the Purveyor of Pandemoneum,
Lord of Lawlessness,

108
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:01,708
Earl of Turmoil,
Bringer of Bedlam...

109
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:05,722
Du-du-dun-dun-dunana DISCORD!

110
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,315
So shall we hop to it?

111
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,611
I've made a list of the
rowdiest establishments

112
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:26,785
in Ponyville. It's
rather short.

113
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:29,374
Actually we're staying here.

114
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,887
I hope you like
AWESOME GAMES!

115
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,889
Games! I love games.
I'm great at games.

116
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,748
Famous Ponies Charades?

117
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:44,037
Oh this is an easy
one. Who am I?

118
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,722
Huh? Huh?

119
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:50,771
OH, COME ON!

120
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:54,155
Uh, I'm talking
about a real game.

121
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,529
Oh, you mean like trapping
best friend ponies

122
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,691
in hedge mazes and turning
them against each other.

123
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:02,371
Those were the days.

124
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,783
Not exactly. Wait here.

125
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,974
Whatever it is,

126
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:13,844
it can only get better
by adding me to the mix.

127
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,783
OK!

128
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:21,054
In a world where
evil reigns supreme,

129
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,552
a small band of
warriors stands tall

130
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:29,190
against the darkness. This
is... Ogres & Oubliettes.

131
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,484
Oh this looks like--

132
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,672
--the best game
ever? You're right!

133
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:42,305
Yes.

134
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:46,512
Ogres & Obliettes is a fantasy
role-playing adventure game.

135
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,430
Our goal? Defeat the
evil Squid Wizard,

136
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:53,727
or as we call him "The Squizard."

137
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,451
The Squizard has laid
siege to the last free city

138
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:04,861
in Spiketopia; that's
the name of the land.

139
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,618
He's kidnapped a beautiful
unicorn princess

140
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:08,988
named Shmarity.

141
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,720
Uh, which is like a
normal name in Spiketopia,

142
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:15,105
so, you know, don't
think about it too much.

143
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:19,185
Fear not. Your romantic
delusions are safe with me.

144
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:24,748
First things first: you've got
to create a character. Name?

145
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:27,708
How 'bout... "Discord."

146
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:31,468
The whole point of the
game is you get to use

147
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,477
your imagination and
be someone you're not.

148
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,583
I'm Garbunkle, a
famous magician.

149
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:39,665
Everyone treats me with
the utmost respect.

150
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:41,454
Just like in real life.

151
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,609
Now, don't get jealous, but
I'm a level 30 enchanter with

152
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,110
major skill points assigned
to intellect and perception.

153
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:50,564
Go on. I'm listening.

154
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:53,910
Big Mac's character is
Sir McBiggun, a level 27

155
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,428
black knight unicorn
from Castle Chadwick.

156
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:57,604
I'm listening.

157
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,461
When his king aligned
himself with the Squizard,

158
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:03,200
Sir McBiggun would not
besmirch his honor.

159
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:04,174
Nnope.

160
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,174
I'm listening.

161
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:10,432
And so it came to pass, the
magician and black knight

162
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:13,731
vowed to rid Spiketopia
of the evil Squizard.

163
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,049
So, your character's name...

164
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,124
I already have the best
name in the universe.

165
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,195
Why would I change it for
something like Captain Wuzz?

166
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,251
Captain Wuzz it is!

167
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,002
What class are
you, Captain Wuzz?

168
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:35,449
There's archers,
mages, rogues...

169
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:38,710
Can I suggest we take a
break and, I don't know,

170
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:40,654
go out and have some fun?

171
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,369
Ponyville's not going
to paint itself red.

172
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:48,348
You'll love it once we get
started. How about an archer?

173
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:53,957
Sounds just as miserable as
the other options, so fine.

174
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,840
"Sir McBiggun," are you
prepared to enter the world

175
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,835
of Ogres & Oubliettes?

176
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,289
Eeyup.

177
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,731
Discord, or should I say,
"Captain Wuzz," are you--

178
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,007
Oh, get on with it.

179
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,484
We find ourselves
trapped in the dungeon

180
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,642
of the evil Squizard. The
bars are locked tight.

181
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:20,903
The bars exist...

182
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,665
...in our imagination.

183
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:29,129
Really, you describe things
and then we pretend it's real.

184
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:33,312
It is real...in
our imagination.

185
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,943
It's your turn first.
What do you want to do?

186
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:39,044
Curse myself for attending
this infernal evening?

187
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:42,983
Oh ha ha, oh you
mean in the game.

188
00:11:43,256 --> 00:11:44,738
Well, you can do
whatever you want.

189
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,094
Then I roll this 20-sided die
to see if you're successful.

190
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,969
I stick my head through
the bars and demand

191
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:53,741
for the immediate release
of the Lord of Chaos.

192
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:55,943
That's a big risk.

193
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,390
You have to roll a seventeen
or higher to succeed.

194
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,061
Oh. Bad idea. The
guard gets mad.

195
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:09,312
This spell here. I transform
him into a parsnip.

196
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:11,515
You need eleven intelligent
points to cast a

197
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,228
"Transform into Root
Vegetable" spell.

198
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:15,712
I'm not intelligent?!

199
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:19,016
I cast it anyway because
this game is stupid.

200
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:24,818
The spell backfires...

201
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:29,840
...so your claws grow leaves
and transform into parsnips.

202
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:33,745
He heh. Parsnips.

203
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:38,795
The guard laughs.

204
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:41,524
He calls his friends
over and they laugh too.

205
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,298
Don't you laugh at
ME, Big Mac!

206
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,637
Does it really say
that? Let me see!

207
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:55,030
As you get angrier,
everypony laughs harder.

208
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,727
I seal Sir McBiggun
in a magic bubble

209
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,632
until he stops laughing.

210
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,124
I told you, you
can't do magic.

211
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,654
Nnope! Nnope! Nnope!

212
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:18,611
Not intelligent
enough, please...

213
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,268
Cut it out, Discord!

214
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,465
Oh, this game is
insufferable!

215
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:25,251
Let me show you a
real Guys' Night.

216
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,644
Ahhhhh, this is the
life. Jazz, dancing,

217
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,044
the best table magic can buy.

218
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:37,011
This is what Guys' Night is
all about. Am I right, fellas?

219
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:40,781
Eeyup!

220
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,903
I know you probably
didn't do this on purpose,

221
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:45,171
but this table's the
perfect size and shape!

222
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,291
I don't think so.
Let's have a drink.

223
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:50,908
Chocolate milkshakes?

224
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:53,468
No, we want to go
back to Ogres and-

225
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:55,647
Oh, how about a
different game?

226
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:02,004
Those are
very bad cards.

227
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,990
Stop messing with
us, we want--!

228
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,047
A dance contest?

229
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:13,275
Surprise! We won.

230
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:15,054
DISCORD!

231
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,962
Yes...?

232
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:21,101
Look, we don't want
to do these things.

233
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,461
We want to play our game.

234
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:24,362
If you don't want to
play with us, you can...

235
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,990
I don't know, sit and watch.

236
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:29,025
Sit and watch?

237
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:31,962
Fine! We'll play your game.

238
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:39,327
ARE YOU READY TO ENTER THE
WORLD OF OGRES & OBLIETTES?

239
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,096
Sir McBiggun?

240
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:48,291
EEYUP!

241
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:52,070
And... I'm Garbunkle?
That means...

242
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:57,115
Sweetness! We're in the
game! Check it out! Ka-ZAM!

243
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,915
It's Guys' Night oh yeah!
In the game now oh yeah!

244
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,665
Discord! Where are you?!

245
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,807
This is great! You
made the game real!

246
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:24,211
Aren't games fun?!

247
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,936
Should we be worried he's
using his scary voice?

248
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:33,957
Behold. I AM THE SQUIZARD!

249
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:38,771
Oh, you're welcome.

250
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:41,745
ATTACK!

251
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,061
RUN!

252
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,352
You find yourself on a battlefield.

253
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:04,672
A barrage of arrows
rains down on you.

254
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:06,451
If you roll a fifteen
or higher,

255
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,920
the shield protects you.

256
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:12,870
Fourteen or lower, and,
well, HA HA you get the idea.

257
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:19,261
Seventeen! Lucky you!

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,362
Boo!

259
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,548
Discord!

260
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:34,343
Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the
entrance if I were you.

261
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,263
This isn't funny.

262
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,291
Isn't this what
every gamer wants?

263
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:43,364
To live the game. Like this!

264
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:52,560
Agh!

265
00:16:57,294 --> 00:17:00,578
This kinda hurts.
Like, real pain!

266
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:02,498
Oh, how kind of
you to notice.

267
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:04,658
It's the little details
that really bring

268
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:08,141
alternate dimensions to
life, wouldn't you say?

269
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,541
Discord, this is awful!

270
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:15,021
Of course it is!
Spiketopia will be mine!

271
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,494
And Rarity shall be my bride!

272
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,324
I mean "Schmarity."

273
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:25,105
Agh!

274
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:27,703
Why are you doing
this? You're the worst!

275
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,517
If I'm the worst, then
why did you invite me?

276
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:33,524
Because we felt
bad for you!

277
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:37,058
Because you-- WHAT!?

278
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:43,496
We're OK. We're OK! No
thanks to you, Discord!

279
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:46,291
YOU felt sorry for ME?

280
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,284
Who wouldn't? Fluttershy
told us you practically

281
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:51,374
begged her to stay, and
then at the train station,

282
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:53,760
you were just standing
there, all alone.

283
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:57,054
This can't be. I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you.

284
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:59,952
Because I'm me,
and you're you.

285
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:03,063
We only invited you
to be nice.

286
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,529
I mean, you're
kind of a weirdo.

287
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:06,480
Eeyup.

288
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:09,614
I ruined your night, and you
don't even think I'm cool?

289
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,912
Oh, how embarrassing.

290
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,576
I should go. I have
a lot of...

291
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:18,004
OTHER friends I
need to see tonight.

292
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:18,800
Good.

293
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,574
Yes, so many other friends.

294
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:27,082
Farewell, Garbunkle
the Magician

295
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,680
and Brave Sir McBiggun.

296
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,207
May providence smile
upon thee and thy quest

297
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:36,108
to rid Spiketopia of
the dreaded Squizard.

298
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,849
When I say it that way, the
game doesn't sound half-bad.

299
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,345
Oh well.

300
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:48,828
It's better this way,
right?

301
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,505
Eeyup.

302
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,016
Because now he can't bother
us cause he's off somewhere

303
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:57,863
by himself... all
alone. With no friends.

304
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,411
Eeyup.

305
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,138
Ahem.

306
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:06,997
We find ourselves in the
dungeon of the evil Squizard.

307
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:10,480
The bars are locked,
and oh who am I kidding?

308
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,324
We should give him
another chance.

309
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:17,369
Captain Wuzz?
Can you hear me?!

310
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:20,983
Oh, you realized
how amazing I am

311
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,967
and that I make you cooler
just by being around me?

312
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:30,207
Uh no, no, actually that's
not what I meant to say.

313
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:36,785
What...?

314
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,748
I'm... 

315
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:41,920
We can't hear you.

316
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:42,484
Nnope.

317
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,510
I'm trying to say
I'm sorry, all right?

318
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,341
I'm sorry for
ruining your game,

319
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:49,510
and I'm sorry that I thought
I was better than you.

320
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:53,294
Now let's play before this
evening gets any sappier,

321
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,056
shall we?

322
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:58,508
Eeyup.

323
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:01,025
Huh? Yeah, yeah OK!

324
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:03,943
What if we forgot the board
and the pieces for a minute?

325
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:06,757
I mean, the whole
"game coming to life"

326
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,230
was completely terrifying,

327
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,357
but also kinda the
best thing ever.

328
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:13,529
So, uh Big Mac and
I were wondering...

329
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,602
what if you toned it
down just a teensy bit?

330
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:26,941
Huh?

331
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:35,877
I've got your
back, Captain Wuzz!

332
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,023
Garbunkle, follow my lead!

333
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,557
Bullseye!

334
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,421
Nice one!

335
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,722
It's Guys' Night / aww yeah
/ havin' fun now / aww yeah.

336
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,444
We should just close the
door and let them finish...

337
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,232
whatever this is.

338
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:14,282
No way! Did you see Big Mac's
sword! I totally want in!

339
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,654
Yeah, I don't know
what it is,

340
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,115
but it looks like
super-duper fun!

341
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,298
GUYS' NIGHT!
