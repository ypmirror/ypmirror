1
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,392
- What?!
- ( overlapping chatter)

2
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,479
( vocalizing )

3
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,664
That was barely
worth the effort, Adagio.

4
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:40,917
I'm tired of fast food.
I need a meal.

5
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,337
The energy in this world
isn't the same as in Equestria.

6
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:47,131
We can only gain
so much power here.

7
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:50,468
Ugh, I wish we'd never
been banished to this awful place.

8
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,555
Really?
I love it here.

9
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:57,600
For realsies? Because I think
this place is the worst.

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,811
I think you're the worst,
Sonata.

11
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,272
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think you're--

12
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:05,066
( groans )
I'll tell you one thing--

13
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,818
being stuck here
with you two

14
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:10,446
isn't making this world
any more bearable.

15
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,302
( gasps )
Did you feel that?

16
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,681
Do you know what that is?

17
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,057
Both: Uh-uh.

18
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,768
It's Equestrian magic.

19
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:44,105
But this world doesn't
have Equestrian magic.

20
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:45,565
It does now.

21
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,818
And we're going to use it
to make everyone

22
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,989
in this pathetic
little world adore us.

23
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,122
<i>( music playing )</i>

24
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:10,465
<i>We used to fight
with each other</i>

25
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,675
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

26
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,802
<i>That was before
we discovered</i>

27
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,138
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

28
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,223
<i>Back when your
friendship was real</i>

29
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:21,267
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

30
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,479
<i>Yeah, you just say
what you feel</i>

31
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,939
<i>And the music</i>

32
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,816
<i>Yeah, the music</i>

33
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,319
<i>Gets us to the top</i>

34
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:37,492
<i>As we learn how the rainbow</i>

35
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,786
<i>Rainbow Rocks!</i>

36
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,672
<i>You can pick up the bass</i>

37
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,674
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

38
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:55,009
<i>And you can play the guitar</i>

39
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,387
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

40
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,597
<i>You can bang on the drums</i>

41
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,474
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

42
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,686
<i>Or you can sing like a star</i>

43
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,437
<i>And the music</i>

44
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,815
<i>Yeah, the music</i>

45
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,442
<i>Gets us to the top</i>

46
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,865
<i>As we learn
how the rainbow</i>

47
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:20,076
<i>Rainbow Rocks!</i>

48
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,374
<i>As we learn
how the rainbow</i>

49
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,793
<i>Rainbow Rocks!</i>

50
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,473
( chatter )

51
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,962
- Want some help?
- Uh, no, thanks. We're good.

52
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,299
Oh, okay.

53
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,927
Sunset Shimmer,
over here!

54
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,599
( chatter continues )

55
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,810
( gasping, whispering )

56
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,442
( sighs ) I had no idea
the whole school would be here.

57
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:40,740
Quite the eye-catching
advertisement if I do say so myself.

58
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,492
And it smells like cake.

59
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,411
It does?
( sniffs )

60
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,789
I used frosting
instead of paste.

61
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,667
Uh, Fluttershy, you've got
a little something... uh...

62
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:57,048
- Did I get it?
- Not exactly.

63
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,843
Good afternoon,
students.

64
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,012
I just wanted
to tell you all

65
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,598
how pleased I am
that so many of you

66
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,892
are going to participate
in the first ever

67
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,561
Canterlot High School
musical showcase.

68
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,439
( cheering )

69
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,651
This is a wonderful
opportunity

70
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,362
to raise money for all
our after-school programs

71
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:20,863
here at CHS.

72
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,241
So keep working on
those signs and posters.

73
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,951
I think it's going to be

74
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,995
one of the most exciting
events we've had at CHS

75
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,873
since the Fall Formal.

76
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,888
I am never gonna
live that down.

77
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,349
You were pretty bad
at the Fall Formal.

78
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,895
A demon. I turned into
a raging she-demon.

79
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,772
And tried to turn everyone here
into teenage zombies

80
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,441
for your own
personal army.

81
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,861
Oh, darling, you have us.

82
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,239
And we've forgiven you
for your past-- ahem-- boo-boos.

83
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,783
To be honest, I'd say
the whole experience

84
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,287
brought everyone at Canterlot High
closer than ever before.

85
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,080
One, two, three.

86
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,207
<i>There</i> was a time
we were apart

87
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,251
<i>But that's behind us now</i>

88
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,795
<i>See how we've made
a brand-new start</i>

89
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,672
<i>And the future's
looking up</i>

90
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:20,965
<i>Oh, oh</i>

91
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,550
<i>And when you
walk these halls</i>

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,927
<i>You feel it everywhere</i>

93
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,889
<i>Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever</i>

94
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,265
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

95
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,018
<i>We are all together</i>

96
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,644
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

97
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,522
<i>Now it's better than ever</i>

98
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,232
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

99
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,942
<i>You can feel it</i>

100
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:45,072
<i>We are back and I'm so glad
that we're better</i>

101
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,074
<i>Better than ever</i>

102
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,243
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

103
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,579
<i>Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever</i>

104
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,665
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

105
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,961
<i>There was a time we couldn't see
past the differences</i>

106
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:03,382
<i>That separated you and me
and it left us on our own</i>

107
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,302
<i>But now you walk these halls</i>

108
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,346
<i>And friends are everywhere</i>

109
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,474
<i>Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever</i>

110
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:12,808
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

111
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,603
<i>We are all together</i>

112
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,229
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

113
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,815
<i>Now it's better than ever</i>

114
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,400
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

115
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,987
<i>Now that we are back on track</i>

116
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,950
<i>Yes, I'm so glad that we're better</i>

117
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,910
<i>Better than ever</i>

118
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,703
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

119
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,081
<i>Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever</i>

120
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,083
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

121
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,251
<i>Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever</i>

122
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,462
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

123
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,548
<i>Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever.</i>

124
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,680
( laughs ) I still can't believe
that happens when we play.

125
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,599
Ooh, I've got to look
into some new accessories.

126
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,977
Something that looks good
in a longer ponytail.

127
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:57,895
Ooh, maybe some
clip-on earrings

128
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,231
for when I get those
adorable pony ears.

129
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,733
I just wonder
why it happens.

130
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,569
Princess Twilight took
her crown back to Equestria.

131
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,155
Shouldn't that mean she took
all the magic back with her?

132
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,658
Who cares why it happens?

133
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,244
It makes my band
totally awesome.

134
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,246
Oh, your band?

135
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,873
Duh, it was my idea
to start the Rainbooms

136
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,542
so we could be
in the showcase.

137
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,377
Plus, I'm the lead singer
and guitarist.

138
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,670
( knock on door )

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,714
Heard you outside.

140
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,590
You guys are sounding
really tight.

141
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,551
Uh, we're getting there.

142
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,053
Rarity's still coming in a little late
on the second verse

143
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,181
and Applejack's bass solo
could use a little work.

144
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:36,600
They'll get it together
in time for the showcase.

145
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,854
Uh, I don't suppose

146
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:43,566
any of our friends
from out of town might come?

147
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:45,776
It being a special
charity event and all.

148
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:49,155
Sorry, Flash, I don't think
Twilight's gonna be back

149
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,157
at Canterlot
High any time soon.

150
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,534
Oh, yeah. Okay.

151
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,037
Just, you know,
thought I'd ask.

152
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,040
Uh, keep on rocking it.

153
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,296
Well, someone is quite
the smitten kitten.

154
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,256
Ooh, sorry.

155
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,259
I always forget you and Flash
used to be an item.

156
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,510
It's okay.

157
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:12,720
Flash is a great guy and all,

158
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,805
but I never really
liked him liked him.

159
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,349
I was just using him
to become more popular.

160
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,603
( sighs ) The old me
really was just awful, wasn't she?

161
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,897
- ( muttering )
- Yup.

162
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,983
But the important thing
is that you've turned yourself around.

163
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,485
Thanks, Applejack.

164
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:31,405
But I'm not sure everyone else
at CHS feels the same way.

165
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,533
Woman on P.A.: Sunset Shimmer,
please report to the main foyer.

166
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:38,120
Gotta run. I volunteered to show some
new students around the school.

167
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,456
Thought it would be good
for them to get to know the new me

168
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:44,085
before they heard
all the stuff about the old me.

169
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,838
We've still got a few minutes
before lunch starts,

170
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,508
what do you say we do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be"?

171
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,593
Um, Rainbow Dash,

172
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,930
I was wondering if we maybe
could play the song I wrote.

173
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,890
We'll get to it.

174
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,850
Oh, okay.

175
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,479
Hi. Are you the girls
I'm supposed to show around?

176
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,731
We are.

177
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,276
Canterlot High
is a great school.

178
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,611
You're really
gonna love it.

179
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,196
Oh, yes.

180
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:16,575
We really sense there's something
magical about this place.

181
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,040
That's the science lab.

182
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,875
Computer lab
is in there.

183
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:28,337
Ooh, we're having a big
musical showcase this weekend.

184
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,881
The whole school is
pretty much rallying around it.

185
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:34,552
A musical showcase?

186
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,263
I'm sure since you're new,
Principal Celestia

187
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,431
will let you sign up
if you're interested.

188
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,726
We have been known to sing
from time to time.

189
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,896
Hello?
We sing, like, all the time.

190
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,315
It's how we get people
to do what we want.

191
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,277
- ( groans )
- What did I say?

192
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,154
What you meant to say

193
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,281
was that being in
a musical showcase

194
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,200
sounds like a great way
to meet other students.

195
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,743
Oh, yeah.

196
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,495
What she said,
I meant to say.

197
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,747
That's what I meant...
to say.

198
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:08,002
And what you would have said
if you weren't the worst.

199
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,545
You are.

200
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,297
You have to excuse them.
They're idiots.

201
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:12,590
Both: Hmmph.

202
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,056
Sunset:
Those are pretty.

203
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:23,934
Where did you--

204
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,020
( laughs )

205
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,190
Sorry. These pendants
mean an awful lot to us.

206
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,984
We'd just hate for anything
to happen to them.

207
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,826
( chatter )

208
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,419
- So how was the tour?
- I don't know.

209
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,463
I mean, these girls,
they were--

210
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,423
there was something off
about them.

211
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,300
Like off like this?

212
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,801
Or off like this?

213
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,303
Or-- ooh, like--

214
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:03,098
Maybe we should
just let her tell us?

215
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,809
That's just it.
I can't put my finger on it.

216
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,313
They just acted sort of
strange around me.

217
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,857
Maybe someone already
talked to them.

218
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,567
Told them about what I did.

219
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,695
( sighs ) So much for making
a good first impression.

220
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,031
Uh-huh.

221
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,909
Ooh, that's
probably not it.

222
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,288
This is it, girls.

223
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,082
The moment we've
been waiting for.

224
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,667
Lunch?

225
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,337
( groans ) The chance to get our
true Equestrian magic back.

226
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,798
Oh, right.

227
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,466
Our voices are
just strong enough

228
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,010
to make them want
something so badly,

229
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,429
they'll fight to get it.

230
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,516
So we're just gonna do
what we always do?

231
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,310
Stir up some trouble
and then feed off the negative energy?

232
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,312
Some plan, Adagio.

233
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,898
It won't be the same
as the times before.

234
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,234
There is Equestrian
magic here.

235
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:59,029
Their negative energy
will give us the power we need

236
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,324
to get this entire world
to do our bidding.

237
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,660
But we can get lunch after,
though, right?

238
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,329
It's Taco Tuesday.

239
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,957
- Just follow my lead.
- Or my lead.

240
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,167
My lead.

241
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,675
( vocalizing )

242
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,446
<i>We heard you want
to get together</i>

243
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:45,159
<i>We heard you want
to rock this school</i>

244
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:50,247
<i>We've got something
that is better</i>

245
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:55,544
<i>Something that changes
all the rules</i>

246
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,590
<i>Why pretend
we're all the same?</i>

247
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,595
<i>When some of us
shine brighter</i>

248
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,141
<i>Here's a chance
to find your flame</i>

249
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,188
<i>Are you a loser or a fighter?</i>

250
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:17,691
<i>Me and you,
you and me</i>

251
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,444
<i>Why don't we see
who is better?</i>

252
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,907
<i>We don't have to be
one and the same thing</i>

253
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:29,495
<i>Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?</i>

254
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:34,917
<i>Are you afraid of failing
the audition?</i>

255
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,045
<i>You're a star
and you should know it</i>

256
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,175
<i>Now you rise above the rest</i>

257
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,471
<i>It doesn't matter who you hurt</i>

258
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,142
<i>If you're just proving
you're the best</i>

259
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,353
( vocalizing )

260
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:59,691
<i>Battle,
you want to win it</i>

261
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,777
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

262
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,488
<i>Battle of the bands</i>

263
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,323
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

264
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,326
<i>We'll go all in it</i>

265
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,370
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

266
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,872
<i>Battle, battle</i>

267
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>Battle of the bands...</i>

268
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,459
I can beat you.

269
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,795
<i>- Battle...
- Ha! You wish.</i>

270
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,214
<i>- Battle...
- I so want this.</i>

271
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,466
<i>- Battle...
- Not if I get it first.</i>

272
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,177
<i>Me and you,
you and me</i>

273
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,972
<i>Why don't we see
who is better?</i>

274
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:34,393
<i>We don't have to be
one and the same thing</i>

275
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:39,273
<i>Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?</i>

276
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:43,652
<i>I'm going out there,
winning the audition</i>

277
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,362
<i>Battle</i>

278
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,656
<i>We want to win it</i>

279
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,825
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

280
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,494
<i>Battle of the bands</i>

281
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,997
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

282
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,207
<i>We'll go all in it</i>

283
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,209
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

284
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,753
<i>Battle, battle</i>

285
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,465
<i>Battle of the bands.</i>

286
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,305
Oh, they're
that kind of off.

287
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,395
Those three are definitely
in possession

288
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,897
of some kind
of dark magic.

289
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,357
How else could you explain
what happened back there?

290
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,486
Don't worry, y'all. We let Principal
Celestia know all about this

291
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,821
and those girls will be kicked
to the curb in no time.

292
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,991
Last thing she needs
is another CHS event

293
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,578
almost ruined by some
power-crazed lunatic.

294
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,038
Uh, no offense.

295
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,248
( sighs )
None taken.

296
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,545
Dark magic?

297
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,256
I find that
very hard to believe.

298
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,133
Those girls came into
my office earlier

299
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,135
and were
absolutely delightful.

300
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,346
Perhaps Sunset Shimmer

301
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,932
is just eager to make someone
else out to be a bad element

302
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,268
so that her actions at the Fall Formal
will become old news.

303
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,395
I could see why
you might think that, but--

304
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,064
That's not what's happening.

305
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,942
We saw all of this go down
in the cafeteria, too.

306
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,361
Yes, but isn't your band

307
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,489
supposed to be part of
the musical showcase?

308
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,782
Yes.

309
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,659
Perhaps you're all
just worried

310
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,494
that the Dazzlings
will steal your spotlight.

311
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,496
The Dazzlings?

312
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,498
It's the name
of their musical group.

313
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,375
That's why they came by
my office earlier.

314
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,834
To sign up for the showcase.

315
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,255
Even sang a little song
to Vice Principal Luna and I.

316
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,007
- They did?
- Yes.

317
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,051
And we think having
a battle of the bands

318
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,845
instead is
a marvelous idea.

319
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,814
I can't believe they got
to Principal Celestia

320
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,816
and Vice Principal Luna, too.

321
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,401
They've gotten
to everybody.

322
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,737
- Not everybody.
- Pinkie Pie's right.

323
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,531
We were there when
the Dazzlings were singing

324
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,157
and we weren't affected.

325
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,076
It was like we were
protected somehow.

326
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,995
So let's take them down.

327
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,039
It's not like we haven't tangled
with dark magic before

328
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,667
and totally whupped
its sorry butt.

329
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,877
Uh, no offense.

330
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,338
( sighs )
None taken.

331
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,756
Again.

332
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,717
But that was when
Twilight was here.

333
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,052
There may be some kind
of magic inside us,

334
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,138
but it only comes out
when we play music.

335
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,473
I sure don't know
how to use it

336
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:22,311
to "whup anybody's butt."

337
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,813
if only we could get
a message to Twilight.

338
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,815
Maybe she could tell us
how to break the spell

339
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,609
the Dazzlings have cast
on our friends.

340
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,527
Well, that's not gonna happen.

341
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,946
The portal's closed.

342
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,489
( screams )

343
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,991
And I get the feeling

344
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,744
they don't exactly have
cell phones where she's from.

345
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,539
I may have an idea

346
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,916
how we can get in touch
with Princess Twilight.

347
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,510
When I was Princess Celestia's
student back in Equestria,

348
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,472
she gave me this.

349
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,600
Even after I abandoned my studies,
I held on to it.

350
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,645
Deep down, I guess I knew
I was making a big mistake

351
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,356
and I still wanted a way
to reach out to her.

352
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,652
Maybe it still works.

353
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,779
Rarity:
That's a book, darling.

354
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,864
What do you mean
maybe still works?

355
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,283
It used to be that
if I wrote something here,

356
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:22,079
it would appear in the pages of a book
back in Princess Celestia's library.

357
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,081
I get a message to her,

358
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,833
then she can get a message
to Princess Twilight.

359
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:30,087
So what are you waiting for?
Get to writing.

360
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,011
Huh.

361
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,056
Been a long time since
I've written these words.

362
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,143
"Dear Princess Celestia."

363
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,179
Excuse me, Princess,

364
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,889
where do you want all these
books from Princess Celestia?

365
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,309
The library.
Third door on the left.

366
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,146
Even this one that's glowing
and vibrating?

367
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,908
What is it, Twilight?

368
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,953
It looks like a message
to Princess Celestia

369
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,663
from my friends
at Canterlot High.

370
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,332
How is that even possible?

371
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,667
I have no idea,

372
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,754
but it sounds like
they need my help.

373
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,009
The way Sunset Shimmer
described them,

374
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,219
I think these new girls
sound an awful lot like

375
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,764
the Sirens.

376
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,849
Not the Sirens!

377
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,186
I don't actually know
what that is.

378
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,731
The Sirens were three beautiful
but dangerous creatures

379
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,901
who had the power to charm
ponies with their music.

380
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,694
But to maintain this power,

381
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,989
they had to feed on the negativity
and distrust of others.

382
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,784
The more of this
negative energy they consumed,

383
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,119
the stronger
their voices became

384
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,830
and the farther they could
spread their dark magic.

385
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,541
I don't think I like
this story very much.

386
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,794
Twilight:
If the Sirens had their way,

387
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,421
they would have divided
and conquered all of Equestria.

388
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,966
But a certain Star Swirl the Bearded
wasn't having it.

389
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:43,970
Rumor has it he found a way
to banish them to another world.

390
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:47,182
One where he believed
their magic power would be lost.

391
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,395
That world must have been the one
where my Canterlot High friends live.

392
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,565
But Star Swirl must have
sent them there ages ago.

393
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,651
How come they're
just surfacing now?

394
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,903
I don't know,
but if my hunch is right

395
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,531
and it is the Sirens
who have come to Canterlot High,

396
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,408
this spell they've cast
is just the beginning.

397
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,620
My friends need me.
I have to get back to them.

398
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,664
I hate to burst your bubble,
Twilight,

399
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,166
but the connection between
their world and Equestria

400
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,419
will still be totally cut off
for a super long time.

401
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,089
Okay, first of all, if there was bubble
blowing going on,

402
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,799
why wasn't I told about it?

403
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,177
And secondly, if the connection
is totally cut off,

404
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:27,848
how was Sunset Shimmer
able to get a message to Twilight?

405
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:31,726
( gasps )
Pinkie, you're a genius.

406
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,603
Yeah, I get that a lot.

407
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,647
Now about those bubbles.

408
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,038
Twilight: ...and the interval between
the two points is defined

409
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,207
as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the separation

410
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,835
between the points along
three spatial dimensions.

411
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,006
- Say what now?
- Duh.

412
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,801
She's gonna take the magic
in here and put it in there.

413
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,470
That'll make the portal open up
so that whenever she wants to,

414
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,306
she can go
from here to there.

415
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,516
There to here.
Here-there.

416
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:15,061
- There to here. Here to there. There--
- We get the idea.

417
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,441
Now to see
if it actually works.

418
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,663
All: Ooh.

419
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,774
All: Ahh.

420
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,985
Don't suppose we could
join you this time around?

421
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,570
Better not.

422
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,530
It could make things
pretty confusing if Canterlot High

423
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,033
all of a sudden had
two of all of you.

424
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,036
( All "oh" )

425
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,704
But I still get to go, right?

426
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,873
There isn't another one of me
at Canterlot High.

427
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,501
And you never know when you might
need your trusty assistant.

428
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,588
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes!

429
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,423
We won't be gone long.

430
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,759
( overlapping chatter )

431
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,928
And don't forget
to dress well.

432
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,101
Ready, Spike?

433
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:38,603
Ready.

434
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,923
( sighs ) I'm starting to think
she's not coming.

435
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,176
All:
Twilight!

436
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:13,471
Ooh. I'm back.

437
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,773
All:
Oh, Twilight.

438
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:26,776
I've got some bad news
about those new girls.

439
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,653
( all groan )

440
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,618
Oh, I do hate that you had
to return at a time of crisis.

441
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,079
We have so much
catching up to do.

442
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,833
For starters, a certain blue-haired
guitar player was just asking about you.

443
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,003
Flash Sentry
was asking about me?

444
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:48,715
Ahem.
Isn't that nice?

445
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:52,385
Perhaps you could give us just the
slightest bit of gossip from your world?

446
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,345
She's got
an official title now.

447
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:58,933
( mimics trumpet fanfare )
The Princess of Friendship.

448
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,644
Wow, that's
really impressive.

449
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,981
Guess you really were
Princess Celestia's prize pupil.

450
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,108
She's even got
her own castle.

451
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,651
A castle?!

452
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,403
You have your own castle?!

453
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,781
Uh, ahem.

454
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,657
Oh, lovely.

455
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:15,992
What's new here?

456
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,286
I mean, besides your school
becoming the target

457
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,872
of dangerous magical creatures
from Equestria.

458
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,666
Yeah,
so that isn't exactly

459
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,044
the only strange thing
that's happened since you left.

460
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,504
<i>( music playing )</i>

461
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,006
...and I'm so glad
that we're better...

462
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,425
Pretty sweet, huh?

463
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,969
It happens to all of us
when we play.

464
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,014
Hmm. My crown
was returned to Equestria,

465
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,184
but some of its magic must have
remained here at Canterlot High.

466
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,936
Now that we're
all back together,

467
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,896
we can use that magic
on the Sirens.

468
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,107
Just like when we were able to use it
on Sunset Shimmer

469
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:51,111
when she turned into
that horrifyingly awful winged monster.

470
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,487
No offense.

471
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,864
None taken.

472
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,658
I'm used to it.

473
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:58,868
They'll never even know
what hit 'em.

474
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,787
( grunting )

475
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,583
We've got nothing to worry about
now that Twilight's back.

476
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,587
Oh, I'm pretty sure I could
find something to worry about.

477
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,631
But it won't be the Sirens.

478
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,508
The sooner we do this,
the better.

479
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,760
Any idea where
the Dazzlings might be?

480
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,391
( slurps )
Ahh.

481
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,059
There's a big party tonight
for all the bands

482
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,602
who signed up
to be in the showcase.

483
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,604
That would include
the Dazzlings.

484
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,985
Looks like we've got
a party to crash.

485
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,613
( chatter )

486
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,962
( sighs )
I'm gonna get more punch.

487
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,841
Twilight?

488
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,093
Oh, bumped into--

489
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,803
always doing...

490
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,805
What are you doing here?

491
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,224
You came back for
the big competition, right?

492
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,143
Something like that.

493
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,770
Not that there's going to be
any real competition.

494
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:11,065
No one here wants this
as bad as my band does.

495
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,912
( chatter )

496
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,165
<i>Can you excuse me
for just a minute?</i>

497
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,136
( overlapping conversations )

498
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:48,144
Adagio:
Oh, no. No one's mingling.

499
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,105
It's like there's some kind
of underlying tension

500
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,441
that could bubble
to the surface at any minute.

501
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:54,984
It's the fruit punch,
isn't it?

502
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,111
I knew I used
too much grape juice.

503
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,989
It's not the fruit punch,
it's us.

504
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,450
But the punch is awful, too.

505
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,869
What do you know
about good fruit punch?

506
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,287
More than you.

507
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,498
- Do not.
- Do, too.

508
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,167
This is just
the kickoff party, girls.

509
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,294
Imagine what a tizzy
they'll be in

510
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,797
by the time the battle of
the bands starts.

511
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,841
There isn't going to be
a battle of the bands.

512
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,718
We're gonna make sure
of that.

513
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,556
All right, girls,
let's do this.

514
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,397
Friendship is magic.

515
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:46,619
Uh, weren't there rainbows
and lasers and stuff last time?

516
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,371
I don't understand.

517
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:49,914
We're all together again.

518
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,417
Why isn't this working?

519
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,382
You, uh, really
need to go ahead

520
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,592
and do that whole
"magic of friendship" thing now.

521
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,219
I'm trying, Spike.

522
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,388
I thought the six of us standing
together against the Sirens

523
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,724
would bring out the magic
we needed to defeat them.

524
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,726
That's what happened before.

525
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:12,395
Talk about throwing down
the gauntlet.

526
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,940
This group is obviously
serious about winning.

527
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,859
A little cocky,
though, aren't they?

528
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,236
Claiming there won't
really be a battle.

529
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:24,532
Seems they think they've already got
this thing all locked up.

530
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:28,995
Not if the great and powerful
Trixie has anything to do with it.

531
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,663
Whatever, Trixie.

532
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,415
We're the best band at CHS.

533
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,293
No. The Crusaders
are gonna win.

534
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,503
( overlapping chatter )

535
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:56,022
Adagio: I think we may have found
what we're looking for.

536
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:59,400
Or rather,
it found us.

537
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,032
Magic.
Don't you see?

538
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,951
Everyone else has fallen
under our spell.

539
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,995
But not these girls.

540
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,873
These girls are special.

541
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,879
It doesn't make any sense.

542
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,672
I should have been able
to create the spark

543
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,132
that would help us
break their spell.

544
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,385
That's how it worked before.

545
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:29,138
But to defeat me, you drew magic
from the crown I was wearing.

546
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,642
The Sirens' magic
comes from their music...

547
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:36,771
so maybe you have to use
the same kind of magic to defeat them.

548
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,689
Or maybe not.

549
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,485
- No, I think you're onto something.
- Really?

550
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,613
It's when you play music
that you transform now, right?

551
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,324
Yup. Ears, tails,
the whole shebang.

552
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,160
So maybe the way to use that magic
to defeat the Sirens

553
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,246
is by playing a musical
counterspell.

554
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:56,249
- You mean like a song?
- Uh-huh.

555
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:59,252
And in order to free everyone
who's been exposed to the Sirens spell,

556
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:01,087
we'll need them all
to hear it.

557
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,839
All: Hmm.

558
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,967
( gasps )
The band competition.

559
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,677
That's the next time
we can be certain

560
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,054
everyone will be in the same place
at the same time.

561
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,515
Guess the Rainbooms are
the band to beat.

562
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,517
And I believe,
you, Twilight,

563
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,854
just became the Rainbooms'
newest member.

564
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,064
( giggling )

565
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,819
So what do you
want to play?

566
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,113
Triangle?
Sousaphone?

567
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,158
- <i>Theremin?
- ( music playing )</i>

568
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,706
So magical.

569
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,541
I might take
a little too long

570
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,585
to learn how to play
something with these.

571
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,044
I'll just sing.

572
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:44,046
Like as in lead singer?

573
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,549
'Cause that's
usually my gig.

574
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,217
This being
my band and all.

575
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,969
It's our band.

576
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,888
And of course
as lead singer.

577
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:55,183
She's the one with the magical knowhow
to help us pull this thing off.

578
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,226
Okay, yeah, that's cool.

579
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,061
I'll just use this
as a chance

580
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:02,648
to hone my already insanely
good lead guitar skills.

581
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:04,609
It's only temporary.

582
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,819
And we don't have to win
the battle of the bands.

583
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,906
We just have to perform during
the first round of the competition.

584
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,617
So let's get to learning
that musical counterspell.

585
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,661
Well, that's just it.
I don't know any.

586
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,246
( all sigh )

587
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:20,082
But I'm sure I could
figure out how to write one.

588
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,461
Totally. Twilight can write a spell
like it's nobody's business.

589
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:26,589
That's pretty much how she got to become
a princess in Equestria.

590
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,091
Technically,
I helped finish a spell.

591
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,302
And there was a little more
to it than that, Spike.

592
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,429
Yeah, whatever.

593
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,847
I've got this.

594
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,265
Come on.

595
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:38,059
Where are you going?

596
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:39,519
Well,
last time we were here,

597
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:41,437
Spike and I spent the night
in the library.

598
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,147
Are you crazy?

599
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,191
We're besties now.

600
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,151
Slumber party at my house.

601
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:54,325
Status update--
okey dokey, Loki.

602
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,634
Hey.
I was about to beat you.

603
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:12,969
I doubt it.

604
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,805
So, Twilight, how's that
counterspell coming?

605
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:18,891
Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great.

606
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,561
Thanks for letting me
use your notebook, Fluttershy.

607
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,980
I really like the song
you wrote for the Rainbooms.

608
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,648
Thanks.
( sighs )

609
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,442
Hopefully one day,
we'll get a chance to play it.

610
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,528
- ( laughing )
- Hey!

611
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:34,907
Twilight, I think I speak
for all of us when I say

612
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,160
I don't know what we would've done
if you hadn't come back to help us.

613
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,495
All: Uh-huh.

614
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,163
( doorbell rings )

615
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:42,999
Pizza's here.

616
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,010
( sighs )

617
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,012
Don't you want any pizza?

618
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:12,069
( snoring )

619
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,184
No, that's not gonna work.

620
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,896
Hey, Twilight.
You're up late.

621
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,732
Just looking over
the counterspell.

622
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,860
We only get one shot at this.
It has to be perfect.

623
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,488
We really are lucky
you're here.

624
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,740
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

625
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,160
Who could possibly need
this much whipped cream?

626
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,870
It must be nice
to have everyone

627
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,665
always looking to you
for answers to their problems

628
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:08,626
instead of waiting for you
to cause a problem.

629
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:11,003
Just because everyone
expects something from you

630
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,922
doesn't mean it's guaranteed
to happen.

631
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,424
But that doesn't stop them
from expecting it.

632
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:16,926
Which only make things harder

633
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,136
because the last thing
you want to do is...

634
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,806
Both:
Let everybody down.

635
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,311
( screams )

636
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,647
Boulder was hungry.

637
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:41,158
I still can't get over the fact that
she's related to Pinkie Pie.

638
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,619
You and me both.

639
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,288
( yawns )
I better get some sleep.

640
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:47,915
Good luck with
the counterspell.

641
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,417
Not that you'll need it.

642
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,335
This must be nothing
compared to the stuff

643
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:54,922
you're expected to deal with
as a princess in Equestria.

644
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,550
Sunset Shimmer...

645
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,346
Never mind.
It's not important.

646
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:09,770
No, I have to be able
to do this.

647
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,689
I have to.

648
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,569
<i>- ( music playing )
- Hey, hey, listen</i>

649
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,281
<i>We've got a message
for you</i>

650
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:23,492
<i>We're not all alike</i>

651
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:27,455
<i>But our friendship is true</i>

652
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:30,833
<i>Yeah, we're really different</i>

653
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,795
<i>But we still get along</i>

654
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,839
<i>So, hey, he)'</i>

655
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:41,177
<i>Listen to our song</i>

656
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:45,055
<i>You may think you're in control</i>

657
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:48,851
<i>But we're here
to prove you wrong</i>

658
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:52,396
<i>With the friendship
of our music</i>

659
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:56,066
<i>With the power of our song</i>

660
00:37:56,317 --> 00:38:00,237
<i>Gonna stomp our feet,
clap our hands</i>

661
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,157
<i>With our magical friendship</i>

662
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:07,495
<i>Gonna stop your evil plan.</i>

663
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,961
Eh, that sounded
way better

664
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,714
than the last five times
you played it.

665
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,925
- ( chuckles )
- Eenope.

666
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,428
I think it's pretty obvious

667
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,514
what's going wrong
with this counterspell.

668
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:30,267
You're turning what should be the chorus
into a five-minute guitar solo?

669
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:32,853
I have to pick up
the slack somehow.

670
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,438
Are you guys even trying?

671
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:35,898
I'm trying.

672
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,942
It's fine.
I'll be fine.

673
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,693
One more time from the top.

674
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,948
Or perhaps we could take
a short break--

675
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:46,909
try on some of the wardrobe choices
I put together.

676
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,328
I'm particularly fond
of this one.

677
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,749
Of course we could always go
with something a bit more modern.

678
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,377
We're trying to
save our school here.

679
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:57,920
Enough with the costumes.

680
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,589
You can never have
enough costumes.

681
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,925
She just wants
to make things fun.

682
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,594
Isn't that what being
in a band is supposed to be?

683
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:08,430
You don't have time
for any of this.

684
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:12,101
You're supposed to check in at the
battle of the bands in 15 minutes.

685
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,270
- ( All gasp )
- Oh, no!

686
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,355
But-- but it's not ready.

687
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,066
If we play the counterspell
in the first round and it doesn't work,

688
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,609
the Sirens will know
what we're up to

689
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,486
and make sure we don't
get a chance to play it again.

690
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,491
Then we'll have to
buy ourselves some time

691
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:28,951
so you can keep
working on it.

692
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,078
And how do you propose
we do that?

693
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,873
We compete in the battle
of the bands for real.

694
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:37,376
I take over lead vocals again
and we stay alive until the finals.

695
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,128
We unleash
the counterspell then.

696
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,755
You'll have figured it out
by the finals, right?

697
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:43,549
Of course she will.

698
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,093
Twilight Sparkle's never met
a problem she couldn't solve.

699
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,971
- Right, Twilight?
- Right.

700
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:52,057
Then let's go win us
a battle of the bands.

701
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,486
Welcome to the first ever

702
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,906
Canterlot High School
battle of the bands.

703
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,825
I believe I speak
for everyone when I say

704
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,036
it is by far
the greatest thing

705
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,663
we have ever done
here at this school.

706
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:16,206
( cheering )

707
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:21,670
We are so glad
our three newest students

708
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:23,672
encouraged us
to turn this event

709
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:25,966
into something exciting.

710
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,636
But as this is now
a competition,

711
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:30,888
we can only choose
one winner.

712
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,515
Who is it going to be?

713
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,309
( chatter )

714
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,528
You feel that, girls?

715
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:49,073
Our true power
is being restored.

716
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,699
( laughing )

717
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,913
Adagio:
And that's before

718
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:58,415
we've tapped into
the strongest magic here.

719
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:01,543
But the Rainblossoms--
or whatever they're called--

720
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:03,504
aren't under our spell.

721
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,632
How exactly are we supposed
to get to their magic?

722
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,842
The Rainbooms
are just as capable

723
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:11,011
of falling apart
as anyone else.

724
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:14,682
They just need a little push
in the wrong direction.

725
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:17,017
I have a feeling
everyone here

726
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:20,062
is going to be lining up
to give them a shove.

727
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,857
( beatboxing )

728
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:30,531
Oh, yeah. Snips and Snails
in the house, yo.

729
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:33,325
<i>They call me M.C. Snips
and it ain't no lie</i>

730
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,661
<i>My favorite food
is like pumpkin pie</i>

731
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,205
<i>I 'm D.J. Snazzy Snails,
I like whales</i>

732
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,749
<i>When I go to the beach,
I always bring my pail</i>

733
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,127
( beatboxing )

734
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,504
<i>Everybody knows
my favorite color is orange</i>

735
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,632
<i>My rhymes are so fly,
they're better than, um...</i>

736
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,259
<i>Than an orange, yo</i>

737
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,428
<i>- Yeah, represent
- Yeah</i>

738
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,972
( beatboxing )

739
00:41:58,017 --> 00:41:59,435
What do we--
what do we do now?

740
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,437
Get off the stage,
I'd like to leave right now.

741
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,689
( beatboxing )

742
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:06,066
Bam. That just happened.

743
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:09,194
- Yeah, we out.
- Snip and Snails outta here.

744
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,864
( feedback )

745
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:15,826
Please do not
drop the microphones.

746
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,328
- Yeah.
- Bam.

747
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:22,082
In your face, Rainbooms.

748
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,292
At least we know one group

749
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,753
who won't stand in the way
of us getting to the finals.

750
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:27,629
Let's get ready to rock.

751
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,256
Wait,
where's Rarity?

752
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:33,052
Ooh, here. I'm here.
( panting )

753
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,228
We will be performing
in front of an audience.

754
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:46,231
I'm not going to wear
something fabulous? Hmm.

755
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,400
( groans )

756
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,695
( chatter)

757
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:56,492
Remember, we have to be
good enough to make it through,

758
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:59,661
but not so good we let the Sirens
see the magic within us.

759
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:01,955
They could realize we plan
to use it against them.

760
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:04,124
Got it.
Be cool enough to win,

761
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,418
but not so cool
that we end up showing off

762
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,629
the whole ears and tails
and rainbows thing.

763
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:12,382
So about 20% less cool.

764
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:15,469
- <i>One, two.
- We just got the day</i>

765
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,471
<i>To get ready</i>

766
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:20,390
<i>And there's only
so much time to lose</i>

767
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:24,269
<i>Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party</i>

768
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,189
<i>So let's think of
something fun to do</i>

769
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:31,985
<i>We don't know
what's gonna happen</i>

770
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:35,447
<i>We just know
it's gonna feel right</i>

771
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,032
<i>All our friends are here</i>

772
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:41,954
<i>And it's time
to ignite the lights</i>

773
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:45,833
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

774
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,627
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail</i>

775
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:52,798
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

776
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,592
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail...</i>

777
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:58,095
<i>So what you didn't get it
right the first time?</i>

778
00:43:58,345 --> 00:43:59,388
Boring.

779
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:02,391
<i>Laugh it off,
no one said it is a crime</i>

780
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:06,186
<i>Do your thing,
you know you're an original</i>

781
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:09,356
<i>Your ideas are so funny
that they're criminal</i>

782
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:12,109
- <i>Ohh, ahh</i>
- <i>( coughing )</i>

783
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,654
<i>We've just got the day
to get ready</i>

784
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:18,574
<i>And there's only
so much time to lose</i>

785
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:22,327
<i>Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party</i>

786
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:23,954
<i>So let's think of
something fun to do</i>

787
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:26,790
- ( chuckling )
- Awesome.

788
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,375
<i>We don't know</i>

789
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,294
<i>What's gonna happen</i>

790
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:33,672
<i>We just know
it's gonna feel right</i>

791
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,465
<i>All our friends are here</i>

792
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:40,220
<i>And it's time
to ignite the lights</i>

793
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,016
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

794
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:47,186
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail</i>

795
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:50,856
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

796
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,817
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail</i>

797
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:57,237
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

798
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,033
<i>- Shake your tail, shake your tail
- ( gasps )</i>

799
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:04,203
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

800
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:07,372
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail</i>

801
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:10,626
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight.</i>

802
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,544
( crying )

803
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,755
( applause )

804
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:19,134
Ruined.

805
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,094
Absolutely ruined.

806
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:24,097
Rarity, were you trying
to make us lose out there?

807
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:26,141
What--
this was not my fault.

808
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,602
This was an act of sabotage.

809
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:31,021
Yeah, well, whoever did this
couldn't have done this

810
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:34,608
if you didn't insist
on dressing like-- like this.

811
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,235
We need to sound good.

812
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,987
Is there some reason
that concept seems to escape you?

813
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:42,115
And what was
with the confetti, Pinkie Pie?

814
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:45,369
How am I supposed to shred
if there's paper stuck in my frets?

815
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:48,121
- It was pretty distracting.
- Ah!

816
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:50,832
Says the girl who was running
from a light the whole time.

817
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,209
A light!

818
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,086
You still sounded
much better

819
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:55,587
than most
of the other bands.

820
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,381
I'm sure you'll make it
to the next round.

821
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,635
But it won't matter if you don't
have that counterspell ready.

822
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,513
You all find a place to practice
where the Sirens can't hear you,

823
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,015
I'll keep an eye on things
around here.

824
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:17,276
I don't think we should
use a classroom.

825
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:24,283
We really need to stop bumping
into each other like this.

826
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,119
Uh, you guys
hear something?

827
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:28,704
- Uh-uh.
- Uh, no.

828
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:31,415
I said we have to stop--

829
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:33,959
There it is again.
So annoying.

830
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,044
Why are you
acting like this?

831
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:37,838
I thought
we were friends.

832
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:40,132
Yeah, and then you decide
to come back here

833
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:42,175
just so you can beat me
in the battle of the bands.

834
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:45,012
I want this, Twilight,
and you're trying to take it from me.

835
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:47,055
Some friend.

836
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:48,307
That's not why--

837
00:46:48,557 --> 00:46:49,975
Come on, Twilight.
We've got things to do.

838
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:51,810
You really think
you're gonna help them?

839
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,521
I bet you have no idea
what you're even doing.

840
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:00,736
( snickers )
Tears already?

841
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,863
This is only
the first round.

842
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:05,907
( laughing )

843
00:47:06,158 --> 00:47:07,826
Principal Celestia:
The next band to take the stage

844
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:10,203
will be Trixie
and the Illusions.

845
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:14,207
Better head back.
We're supposed to go on after Trixie.

846
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:21,173
You're never gonna
get away with this.

847
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:23,550
Why, because you didn't?

848
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,472
Oh, we know all about you,
Sunset Shimmer.

849
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:31,016
You've got quite
the reputation at Canterlot High.

850
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,685
I've changed.
I'm in a much better place now.

851
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,688
Waiting in the wings
while your friends have all the fun?

852
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:40,025
Oh, yes,
you girls are so tight.

853
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:43,362
And yet they didn't ask you
to be in the band?

854
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:46,031
Probably afraid no one
would want to see them play

855
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,200
if she was
in the group.

856
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,534
Too bad.

857
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:50,994
So sad.

858
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,662
Adagio:
If it's any consolation,

859
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:55,123
no one is going to
remember you at all

860
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:57,167
by the time
we're done.

861
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,053
Remember, girls,
we want to save the good stuff

862
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:10,806
for when our full power
has been restored.

863
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:15,560
<i>- ( Music playing )
- Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

864
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:17,729
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

865
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,107
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

866
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:22,275
<i>Now that you're
under our spell</i>

867
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:24,945
<i>Blindsided by the beat</i>

868
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:27,197
<i>Clapping your hands,
stomping your feet</i>

869
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,408
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

870
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:31,451
<i>Oh</i>

871
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:34,079
<i>Now you've fallen
under our spell</i>

872
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,415
<i>Oh</i>

873
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:39,084
<i>We've got the music,
makes you move it</i>

874
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,294
<i>Got the song
that makes you lose it</i>

875
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,755
<i>We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"</i>

876
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,882
<i>Put your hands up
to the sky</i>

877
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:48,176
<i>We've got the music,
makes you move it</i>

878
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:50,595
<i>Got the song
that makes you lose it</i>

879
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:52,931
<i>We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"</i>

880
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:55,100
<i>Put your hands up
to the sky</i>

881
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,102
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

882
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,479
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

883
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:01,648
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

884
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,942
<i>Now that you're
under our spell</i>

885
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,403
<i>Listen to the sound
of my voice</i>

886
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,238
<i>Oh</i>

887
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:11,158
<i>Soon you'll find
you don't have a choice</i>

888
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:12,909
<i>Oh</i>

889
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,787
<i>Captured in the web
of my song</i>

890
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,414
<i>Oh</i>

891
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:20,709
<i>Soon you'll all
be singing along</i>

892
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,210
<i>Oh</i>

893
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:25,046
<i>We've got the music,
makes you move it</i>

894
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:27,340
<i>Got the song
that makes you lose it</i>

895
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:29,718
<i>We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"</i>

896
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:31,970
<i>Put your hands up
to the sky</i>

897
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,431
<i>We've got the music,
makes you move it</i>

898
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,683
<i>Got the song
that makes you lose it</i>

899
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,894
<i>We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"</i>

900
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:41,271
<i>Put your hands up
to the sky</i>

901
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,106
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

902
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,484
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

903
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:47,652
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

904
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:50,113
<i>Now that you're
under our spell</i>

905
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:52,491
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

906
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:54,951
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

907
00:49:55,202 --> 00:49:56,995
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

908
00:49:57,245 --> 00:50:00,499
<i>Now that you're
under our spell.</i>

909
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:02,667
( cackling )

910
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:17,516
This is it, last round
and you're in the finals.

911
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:21,061
Unless you think the counterspell
is ready to be played now.

912
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:25,190
Don't worry, Twilight,
finals aren't until tonight.

913
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,608
We'll get in a little
more practice

914
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,235
before we're
supposed to hit the stage.

915
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:30,904
- We won't let you down.
- All: Yeah.

916
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:33,615
You won't let me down.

917
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,243
Fluttershy:
Um, I was just wondering,

918
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:39,579
we haven't played any
of my songs yet and--

919
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:40,956
It's the semifinals.

920
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:42,457
We've gotta do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be."

921
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,460
I don't know why I even asked.

922
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,379
<i>...got tricks
up my sleeve</i>

923
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:53,593
<i>See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.</i>

924
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,431
Oh! Fantastic.

925
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:04,980
You're never gonna top
that performance, "Raingoons."

926
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,565
You shouldn't
be allowed to

927
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:09,442
when you have such
a big advantage over the rest of us.

928
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:11,486
My superior guitar playing

929
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,780
and off-the-charts
awesome singing voice?

930
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,824
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

931
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,534
I mean her.

932
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:20,495
If you were really all that,
Rainbow Dash,

933
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,248
you wouldn't have needed
to bring in some magical ringer

934
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:24,708
to have half a chance.

935
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,668
Everyone's talking about it.

936
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,461
Ha! Please.

937
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:30,338
I could win this thing
as a solo act

938
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:33,133
and everybody knows it.

939
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:34,843
Sure, you could.

940
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:38,763
(coughing )

941
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:42,559
She's gone!

942
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:44,853
Oh, wait.
There she is.

943
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,732
Principal Celestia:
Next up, the Rainbooms.

944
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:53,903
- Knock 'em dead, Rainbooms.
- I'll be here.

945
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:56,865
Just watching.

946
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:05,373
<i>- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
- Awesome as I wanna be</i>

947
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:09,586
<i>Hey, hey, he)',
hey, hey, hey</i>

948
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:11,212
<i>Awesome as I wanna be</i>

949
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:13,882
<i>First you see me
riding on a sonic boom</i>

950
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,551
<i>Got my guitar
shredding up my latest tune</i>

951
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:19,137
<i>There is nothing
you can do to beat me</i>

952
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,848
<i>I'm so good
that you can't defeat me</i>

953
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:24,726
<i>Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution</i>

954
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,562
<i>Watch out for me,
I'm awesome as I wanna be</i>

955
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:30,357
<i>Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution</i>

956
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:33,151
<i>Watch out for me,
I'm as awesome as I wanna be</i>

957
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:37,697
<i>Hey, hey, he)',
hey, hey, hey</i>

958
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:42,494
<i>Hey, hey, hey, he)',
hey, hey.</i>

959
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,420
( screams )

960
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:03,640
Now that's the bad girl
we love to hate.

961
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,351
- ( cheering )
- I knew she was still trouble.

962
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:09,354
Boy:
The real Sunset Shimmer is back.

963
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,691
No, it isn't like that.

964
00:53:16,528 --> 00:53:18,363
What was that?

965
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:19,989
You were showing them
your magic.

966
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,783
I didn't know
what else to do.

967
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,452
Close the curtains.
Unplug her amp.

968
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:26,329
Give us a chance to deal
with the situation.

969
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,540
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to help.

970
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,375
Yeah, well, you didn't.

971
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,461
None of this would've happened
if you weren't trying to show off.

972
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:34,879
As usual.

973
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,340
Good show, "Rainbrooms."

974
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,926
I especially like the part
where Sunset Shimmer,

975
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:41,803
in a fit of jealous rage,

976
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:45,265
knocked out Rainbow Dash
mid guitar solo.

977
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:47,726
It wasn't a fit
of jealous rage.

978
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:52,272
If you say so.

979
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:55,316
Ooh, looks like
they've already decided

980
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:57,110
who'll be moving on
to the finals.

981
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,447
I'm guessing it wasn't
too difficult a decision.

982
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,575
( vocalizing )

983
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:10,331
- Huh?
- Rarity: What can we do?

984
00:54:10,582 --> 00:54:12,917
There isn't gonna be another
opportunity for us to play.

985
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:16,671
And I had the most gorgeous
outfit for the finals.

986
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,758
Yup, 'cause that's
he real tragedy here, Rarity.

987
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:21,509
That you won't
get to play dress-up.

988
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,762
You know perfectly well
that is not what I meant.

989
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:25,764
You guys wanna
keep it down?

990
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,140
They're about to
announce who's moving on.

991
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,391
Who are you kidding?

992
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:30,602
You know it isn't
gonna be us.

993
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:37,066
The band that will be joining
the Dazzlings in tonight's finals...

994
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:39,194
the Rainbooms.

995
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:40,904
- What?!
- All: Huh?

996
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:43,239
Did they just say
"The Rainbooms"?

997
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:46,493
This isn't over.

998
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,497
Congratulations, girls.

999
00:54:50,747 --> 00:54:52,499
You deserve it.

1000
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:55,168
Seriously?
We didn't even finish our--

1001
00:54:57,337 --> 00:55:00,340
See you at tonight's
big show, Rainbooms.

1002
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,802
We are really
looking forward to it.

1003
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:06,387
Yeah, well,
not as much as we are.

1004
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:08,640
( crowd booing, jeering )

1005
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,267
This never should have been you,
Rainbooms.

1006
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,490
This is a travesty.

1007
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,492
A travesty!

1008
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,077
It really is.

1009
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,579
The Rainbooms don't deserve
to be in the finals.

1010
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,666
Not when your band
was so much better in the semis.

1011
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:37,001
And wanted it
so much more.

1012
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:39,420
Alas, this is the way
it's going to be.

1013
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:41,756
Dazzlings
versus Rainbooms.

1014
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:44,259
Unless, of course, the Rainbooms
don't manage to make it to their set

1015
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,511
were held up
for some reason.

1016
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,638
Hmm?
( laughing )

1017
00:55:56,855 --> 00:55:59,482
Check one, two.
Testing. Testing.

1018
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:05,154
- Testing.
- ( feedback )

1019
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,618
This doesn't
make any sense.

1020
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:12,203
We were awful.

1021
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,497
Doesn't anybody else
think it's strange

1022
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,958
that we're the ones
that made it to the finals?

1023
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,003
Very strange.

1024
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:22,005
What are you doing here,
Trixie?

1025
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:25,091
Pretty sure the losers are supposed
to be up there in the cheap seats.

1026
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,510
The great and powerful Trixie

1027
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,138
is the most talented girl
at Canterlot High.

1028
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:33,016
It is I who deserve to be
in the finals.

1029
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,685
And I will not be denied.

1030
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:38,688
( all scream )

1031
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:48,531
( cackling )

1032
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:52,660
See you never.

1033
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,419
Told you someone
would give them a shove.

1034
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:03,838
She didn't shove them,
she pulled the lever.

1035
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,716
Oh, go back to sleep,
Sonata.

1036
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:12,221
<i>You better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve</i>

1037
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:16,434
<i>And I captivate 'cause
I'm powerful and great</i>

1038
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:22,565
<i>You'd better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve</i>

1039
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:27,820
<i>See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great...</i>

1040
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:35,411
Applejack:
Give it up, Rainbow Dash.

1041
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:38,957
You've been trying at this for hours.
It's not gonna open.

1042
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,378
Maybe it doesn't even matter
that we're trapped down here.

1043
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,838
I don't think the counterspell
would've worked anyway.

1044
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:47,715
'Course it would've worked,
Twilight.

1045
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:50,718
Assuming a certain band member
didn't try to hog the spotlight

1046
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,345
the whole time
we were trying to play it.

1047
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:54,555
Hey, if you want
to tell Twilight

1048
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:56,057
she's getting
a little too caught up

1049
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,767
trying to be the new leader of this
band,

1050
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:00,144
you don't have to be
all cryptic about it.

1051
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:04,148
She was talking about you,
Rainbow Dash.

1052
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:05,483
Me?!

1053
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,235
I'm just trying
to make sure my band

1054
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:09,195
rocks as hard
as it needs to.

1055
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:11,322
All:
Our band!

1056
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,199
But why wasn't it working?

1057
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:14,701
I should know what to do.

1058
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:16,494
How can I not know
what to do?

1059
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:18,413
How could I
have failed like this?

1060
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:20,915
It might've been your idea
to start a band,

1061
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,668
but it's not just your band,
Rainbow Dash.

1062
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:25,795
I'm the one who writes
all the songs.

1063
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,215
I write songs.
You just never let us play any of them.

1064
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:32,093
I had the most perfect
outfits for us to wear.

1065
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:34,012
Again with the costumes.

1066
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:35,763
No one cares
what we're wearing.

1067
00:58:36,014 --> 00:58:37,557
I care, Applejack.

1068
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:41,102
So sorry if I enjoy trying to make
a creative contribution to the band.

1069
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,730
Hey, anybody here
remember fun?!

1070
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,273
I'll give you a hint--

1071
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:48,693
it's the exact opposite
of being in the Rainbooms!

1072
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:51,696
I wish I never asked
any of you to be in my band.

1073
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:56,325
- I wish I never agreed to be in it!
- Both: Me neither.

1074
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:58,536
( overlapping yelling )

1075
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:11,299
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1076
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:15,303
<i>Better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve</i>

1077
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:21,517
<i>See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.</i>

1078
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:25,855
( crowd cheering )

1079
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,029
Try to top that.

1080
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:36,282
Oh, gosh,
I don't know if we can.

1081
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:38,868
( laughs )

1082
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,004
<i>( music playing )</i>

1083
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:59,639
( vocalizing )

1084
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:17,448
( overlapping yelling
continues )

1085
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,161
Stop!
You have to stop!

1086
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,664
This is what
they've been after all along.

1087
01:00:24,914 --> 01:00:27,416
They're feeding off
of the magic inside you.

1088
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,669
How can they
be using our magic?

1089
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,337
It's the magic
of friendship.

1090
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:35,091
Ever since you started
this band,

1091
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:37,218
you've been letting
little things get to you.

1092
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:40,388
I never said anything 'cause
I didn't feel like it was my place.

1093
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:44,058
Not when I was so new to this
whole friendship thing.

1094
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,352
I still have a lot to learn.

1095
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:48,396
But I do know that
if you don't work out

1096
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:50,898
even the smallest problems
right at the start,

1097
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:54,235
the magic of friendship
can be turned into something else.

1098
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:57,822
I can't believe
all this tension was happening

1099
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,074
right under my nose
and I didn't realize it.

1100
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,326
I'm supposed to be the one
with all the answers.

1101
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:06,247
And all I've done
since I got here is let you down.

1102
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:10,501
I don't think anyone
is supposed to have all the answers.

1103
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:14,088
But you can count
on your friends to help you find them.

1104
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:17,633
I think you already have.

1105
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:19,969
Come on, we need to
get out of here.

1106
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,598
( all grunting )

1107
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,725
( knocks )

1108
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,185
Spike!

1109
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:31,272
Sorry I took so long.

1110
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:32,940
I had to find somebody who wasn't
under the Sirens' spell

1111
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:34,358
to help me get you out.

1112
01:01:36,152 --> 01:01:38,237
Why isn't she
under their spell?

1113
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:39,780
Never takes off
her headphones.

1114
01:01:41,324 --> 01:01:42,825
Come on, y'all.

1115
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:45,244
Time to prove we've still got the magic
of friendship inside us.

1116
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,246
And there's only
one way to do it.

1117
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,123
We're getting the band
back together?

1118
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:51,209
We're getting
our band back together.

1119
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:54,170
- Whee!
- Oh, which version of the counterspell

1120
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,546
are we going to play?

1121
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,840
I don't think it matters
what song we play

1122
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:01,219
as long as we play it
together as friends.

1123
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:02,595
I know just the song.

1124
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:06,182
Fluttershy's written
a really great one.

1125
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:09,393
We're about to
save the world here.

1126
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:12,563
Personally,
I think we should do it in style.

1127
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:15,608
- Rarity?
- I thought you'd never ask.

1128
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,487
( vocalizing )

1129
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:31,415
<i>Welcome to the show</i>

1130
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:36,420
<i>We're here
to let you know</i>

1131
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:40,716
<i>Our time is now</i>

1132
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:43,928
<i>Your time is running out</i>

1133
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,138
( vocalizing )

1134
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:52,019
How are we supposed
to play over them from up here?

1135
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,437
( horn honks )

1136
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,607
( honks )

1137
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,907
( cheering )

1138
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:07,702
<i>Feel the wave of sound</i>

1139
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,329
<i>As it crashes down</i>

1140
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,581
<i>You can't turn away</i>

1141
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:15,418
<i>We'll make you wanna stay</i>

1142
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:18,379
<i>We will be adored</i>

1143
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:20,548
<i>Tell us that you want us</i>

1144
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:23,426
<i>We won't be ignored</i>

1145
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:25,678
<i>It's time for our reward</i>

1146
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,014
<i>Now you need us</i>

1147
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:30,683
<i>Come and meet us</i>

1148
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:35,688
<i>Nothing can stop us now</i>

1149
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:38,566
<i>- ( music playing )
- Oh, whoa</i>

1150
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,985
<i>I've got the music in me</i>

1151
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,404
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

1152
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:47,825
<i>Don't need
to hear a crowd</i>

1153
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,786
<i>Cheering out my name</i>

1154
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:55,041
<i>I didn't come here
seeking infamy or fame</i>

1155
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:57,710
<i>The one and only thing</i>

1156
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,587
<i>That I am here to bring</i>

1157
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,589
<i>ls music,
is the music</i>

1158
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,050
<i>ls the music
in my soul</i>

1159
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,509
<i>Gonna break out</i>

1160
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,013
<i>Set myself free, yeah</i>

1161
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:10,890
<i>Let it all go, go</i>

1162
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,517
<i>Just let it be, yeah</i>

1163
01:04:13,768 --> 01:04:16,145
<i>Find the music
in your heart</i>

1164
01:04:16,395 --> 01:04:18,397
<i>Let the music
make you start</i>

1165
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:23,069
<i>To set yourself apart</i>

1166
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:27,073
So the Rainbooms want to turn this
into a real battle of the bands?

1167
01:04:27,323 --> 01:04:28,949
Then let's battle.

1168
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,035
<i>What we have in store</i>

1169
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:33,746
<i>All we want and more</i>

1170
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:35,956
<i>We will break on through</i>

1171
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:39,293
<i>Now it's time
to finish you</i>

1172
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,626
<i>Oh, oh...</i>

1173
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,839
( vocalizing )

1174
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:57,913
Sunset Shimmer,
we need you.

1175
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:09,091
<i>( music playing )</i>

1176
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:14,263
<i>You're never gonna
bring me down</i>

1177
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:17,766
<i>You're never gonna
break this part of me</i>

1178
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:21,479
<i>My friends are here
to bring me around</i>

1179
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:25,149
<i>Not just singing
for popularity</i>

1180
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:27,276
<i>We're here
to let you know</i>

1181
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:28,944
<i>That we won't let it go</i>

1182
01:06:29,195 --> 01:06:32,072
<i>Our music is a bomb
and it's about to blow</i>

1183
01:06:32,323 --> 01:06:33,991
<i>And you can try to fight</i>

1184
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:38,787
<i>But we have got the light
of friendship on our side</i>

1185
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:41,832
<i>Got the music
in our hearts</i>

1186

<i>We're here to blow
this thing apart</i>

1187
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:49,423
<i>And together,
we will never</i>

1188
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,760
<i>Be afraid of the dark</i>

1189
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:56,388
<i>Here to sing our song
out loud</i>

1190
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,808
<i>Get you dancing
with the crowd</i>

1191
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:05,314
<i>As the music
of our friendship survives</i>

1192
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,107
<i>Survives</i>

1193
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:10,319
<i>Got the music
in our hearts</i>

1194
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:13,948
<i>We're here to blow
this thing apart</i>

1195
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:17,618
<i>And together,
we will never</i>

1196
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:21,163
<i>Be afraid of the dark</i>

1197
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:24,750
<i>Here to sing our song

1200
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:39,223
<i>Survives, survives</i>

1201
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:01,662
( singing off-key )
<i>We will be adored<i>

1202
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:03,664
<i>Tell us that you want us</i>

01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:09,962
- ( booing )
<i>- It's time for our reward...</i>

1205
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:18,345
Guess that explains why these were
so special to them.

1206
01:08:18,596 --> 01:08:21,682
Without those pendants and the magic
you brought here from Equestria,

1207
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:24,268
they're just three
harmless teenage girls.

1208
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:28,063
Rainbooms rule!
That was amazing.

1209
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,817
( giggling )

1210
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:37,740
You may have vanquished
the Dazzlings,

1211
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:41,201
but you will never have the amazing
showstopping ability

1212
01:08:41,452 --> 01:08:44,079
of the great
and powerful Trixie.

1213
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:47,333
( coughing )

1214
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:51,003
She's gone!

1215
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,506
Oh, wait.
There she is.

1216
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:59,094
( groans )
Trixie's okay.

1217
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:02,181
You know, Twilight is going back
to Equestria soon.

1218
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:03,849
The Rainbooms
could really use

1219
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:06,769
someone to help Fluttershy
on backup vocals.

1220
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,276
I also play guitar.

1221
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:19,823
We'll see.

1222
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,585
Sure wish
you could stay longer.

1223
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,421
Me, too, but I have
responsibilities

1224
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:36,507
in Equestria
that I have to get back to.

1225
01:09:36,757 --> 01:09:39,677
Its citizens need me.

1226
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:43,013
But now I can go through the portal
whenever I need to.

1227
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:46,892
This isn't good-bye,
it's just good-bye till next time.

1228
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:49,812
- Ready?
- Ready.

1229
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:04,284
"Dear
Princess Twilight,

1230
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:07,955
missing you already
and hope you'll be back soon.

1231
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:11,458
Things are definitely looking up
for me here at Canterlot High,

1232
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:15,379
but I know I still have a lot
to learn about friendship.

1233
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:18,549
Hope you don't mind if I write to you
for advice when I need it.

1234
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:21,427
Your friend,

- You ready or what?
- Ready.

01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,933

<i>And you can count on me
to be there by your side</i>

1246
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:15,147
<i>And when the music
comes alive</i>

1247
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:19,526
<i>We sing our songs to
lift us up so we can shine</i>

1248
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:23,280
<i>And the sound
that we hear in our hearts</i>

1249
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:28,076
<i>Makes a crescendo</i>

1250
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:31,872
<i>And the light that ignites
in the dark</i>

1251
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:36,376
<i>It makes us all glow</i>

1252
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:40,714
<i>And shine like rainbows</i>

1253
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:46,220
<i>We shine like rainbows</i>

1254
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:50,098
<i>Together we stand</i>

1255
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:56,104
<i>As the rain
begins to fall</i>

1256
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:59,066
<i>And holding
our heads up high</i>

1257
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:03,195
<i>As the sun shines
through it all</i>

1258
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:07,282
<i>And the sound
that we hear in our hearts</i>

1259
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:12,079
<i>Makes a crescendo</i>

1260
01:12:12,329 --> 01:12:15,415
<i>And the light
that ignites in the dark</i>

1261
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:20,629
<i>It makes us all glow</i>

1262
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:24,758
<i>And shine like rainbows</i>

1263
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:29,179
<i>We shine like rainbows</i>

1264
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:33,433
<i>Shine like rainbows</i>

1265
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:37,938
<i>We shine like rainbows</i>

1266
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:42,401
<i>Shine like rainbows.</i>

1267
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:08,176
No doubt about it, Spike.

1268
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:11,680
There's definitely something strange
going on at that school.
