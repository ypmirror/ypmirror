1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,424
I just don't feel like
it's quite finished.

2
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:12,686
I know what you mean.

3
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,466
It's for Miss Cheerilee,
it needs to be perfect.

4
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:18,106
Hearts and Hooves Day
only comes once a year.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,402
I say we add a little more ribbon!

6
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:21,680
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:24,431
And just a tiny bit more lace.

8
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,997
A few more hoof-prints.

9
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:30,150
Glitter!

10
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:32,905
It could definitely use
just a little more glitter.

11
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:40,215
Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee
how much we care about her.

12
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:43,456
Just have to get it to the
Hearts and Hooves party at school.

13
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,665
I think we're gonna need
a bigger envelope...

17
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:32,956
It's lovely.
And so...

18
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:35,500
...big!

19
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,447
We just wanted to let you know that
we think you're the best teacher

20
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,484
in the whole wide world!

21
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:43,100
And we think you're super!
And that we love you so so much!

22
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,768
And we want you to have
the best Hearts and Hooves Day...

23
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:46,830
...ever!

24
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,423
Thank you so much, girls.

25
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:49,824
I love it, I really do.

26
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:53,638
I'm sure it's nothing compared to
the gifts you've gotten from your...

27
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,066
...very special somepony!

28
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,983
I don't have a very special somepony
at the moment.

29
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,434
Really?

30
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:05,079
How could somepony as amazing as you
not have a very special somepony

31
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,780
in Hearts and Hooves Day?

32
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:09,294
It's alright, Sweetie Belle.

33
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,018
I have lots of good friends
and wonderful students

34
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:13,790
who care about me very much.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,859
I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific
Hearts and Hooves Day!

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,900
Alright everypony,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,235
who's ready to play
"pin the heart on the pony"?

38
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,869
If anypony deserves
a very special somepony,

39
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,196
it's her!

40
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:33,000
You alright?

41
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,481
I'm more than alright,

42
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:37,364
I've just come up
with the best idea ever!

43
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:40,840
We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee
a very special somepony...

44
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:45,477
- That is the best idea ever.
- Told you!

45
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:47,275
So, what are we waiting for?

46
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:49,679
Hearts and Hooves Day
is almost over!

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,079
Let's get out there and find
somepony special for Cheerilee already.

48
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,273
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

49
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,922
Now it can't be just any pony.

50
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:04,876
Miss Cheerilee is one of
the best mares in Ponyville.

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,720
She deserves to have
one of the best stallions

52
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,714
as her very special somepony.

53
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,852
<i>Cheerilee is sweet and kind</i>

54
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:20,695
<i>She's the best teacher we could hope for</i>

55
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:24,850
<i>The perfect stallion you and I must find</i>

56
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:30,650
<i>One to really make her heart soar</i>

57
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:32,403
<i>But...</i>

58
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:33,604
<i>This one's too young</i>

59
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,810
<i>This one's too old</i>

60
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:39,747
<i>He clearly has a terrible cold</i>

61
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:41,533
<i>This guy's too silly</i>

62
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,200
<i>He's way too uptight</i>

63
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:44,234
I say!

64
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:46,350
<i>Well, nothing's wrong with this one</i>

65
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,131
<i>He seems alright</i>

66
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:51,074
<i>His girlfriend sure thinks so...</i>

67
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,000
<i>How 'bout this one?</i>

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,231
<i>He's much too flashy</i>

69
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:55,840
<i>He might do</i>

70
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,295
<i>If he weren't so splashy</i>

71
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,853
<i>Too short</i>

72
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:00,854
<i>Too tall</i>

73
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:01,655
<i>Too clean</i>

74
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:02,656
<i>Too smelly</i>

75
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:08,400
<i>He's strangely obsessed
with types of jelly</i>

76
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:12,873
<i>I don't think that we're mistaken</i>

77
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:17,120
<i>It seems all the good ones are taken</i>

78
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,300
<i>I really feel that at this rate</i>

79
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,212
<i>We'll never find the perfect date</i>

80
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:23,268
<i>Don't wanna quit and give up hope</i>

81
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:26,141
Doing anything special
for Hearts and Hooves Day?

82
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,080
<i>Oh please oh please oh please say...</i>

83
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,181
Nope.

84
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,037
<i>We did it girls, we've found the one</i>

85
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:37,379
<i>Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter</i>

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,500
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,256
Are you talkin' about my brother?

88
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,701
Sweetie Belle is right.

89
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:53,594
Big Macintosh is the perfect match
for Miss Cheerilee.

90
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:57,450
He's really nice, super hard-working...

91
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,275
But he's also pretty shy!

92
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,618
He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee
to be his very special somepony.

93
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,449
Maybe he doesn't have to.

94
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,062
If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee
in a really romantic setting,

95
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,260
I bet she'll ask him!

96
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,030
Sounds like a plan to me.

97
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,591
So? What are we waiting for?

98
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:21,767
Let's get out there
and create the perfect date.

99
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,378
Flowers.
Don't forget the flowers.

100
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,086
Oops.
I'm on it!

101
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:38,435
They're coming!

102
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,402
This is gonna be perfect.

103
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,743
Miss Cheerilee is gonna have
the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever.

104
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,744
With her new very special somepony.

105
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,850
Hi, girls!

106
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,611
Hi, Miss Cheerilee!

107
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:55,840
So, you three said you needed
help identifying a tree

108
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,456
you found here near the gazebo?

109
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:02,930
That's an apple tree.

110
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:04,100
Is it?

111
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:12,150
Sorry, big brother.

112
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,113
We went and fixed up
the gazebo all on our own.

113
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,651
See?

114
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:19,597
As long as you're here,
why not have a bite to eat

115
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,595
from this romantic-looking picnic?

116
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:25,692
Oh gosh, seems like
there's only room for two!

117
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:28,284
I guess we'll just be going, then.

118
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,528
You really think this'll work?

119
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,800
Of course it will work,
they're perfect for each other.

120
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,949
Beautiful day we're having.

121
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:48,780
Eeyup.

122
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:51,885
Any big plans for tonight?

123
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:53,655
Nope.

124
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:59,483
Oh, come on Miss Cheerilee!

125
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:02,124
Ask him to be your
very special somepony.

126
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:04,200
Oh my gosh, look.

127
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:13,260
Big Mac...

128
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,361
Eeyup?

129
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,385
You have something
stuck in your teeth.

130
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,877
OH, COME ON!

131
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:25,488
Well, this has been... strange.

132
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:26,886
Eeyup.

133
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,060
I need to get going.

134
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,530
But it's always great running
into a good friend.

135
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,547
Eeyup.

136
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:42,338
Do you think it just wasn't
romantic enough?

137
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,604
Maybe it was too romantic.

138
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:47,330
Either way, we failed.

139
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,006
There's gotta be something else we could...

140
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh my goodness,
I didn't even see you there.

141
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,350
I'm so so sorry.

142
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,567
It's okay Twilight,
it was an accident.

143
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:02,230
I've just been reading the most
fascinating book about

144
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,587
Hearts and Hooves Day.

145
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,580
Did you know that
this holiday got its start

146
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,325
because of a love potion?

147
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,189
Did you say... a love potion?

148
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,460
That's right.
It even has the recipe.

149
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:21,155
I don't suppose we could borrow
that book for a little while, do ya?

150
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,890
Of course you can.

151
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,484
I have another book here,
that I think you'll...

152
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,901
Take a tuft of cloud.

153
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:41,719
A bright rainbow's glow.

154
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,897
Stir with a Pegasus feather.

155
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,740
Fast, not slow.

156
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:57,736
Serve to ponies
who aren't in the know.

157
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:05,511
I feel kinda bad tricking my brother
and Miss Cheerilee this way...

158
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,812
What's the problem?

159
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,594
We all agreed these two
are perfect for one another.

160
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:12,246
Yeah, they just need a little nudge.

161
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,720
And what can make them happier
than being together, right?

162
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,524
Right!

163
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,107
Here they come!

164
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:22,869
Hi, Miss Cheerilee.

165
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,170
Hello again, girls.

166
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,371
Hello, Big Mac.

167
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:29,333
Would you three like to tell us
why it was so very important

168
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,000
- ...that we meet you here?
- Punch!

169
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,000
Excuse me?

170
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,752
Punch!
We made punch.

171
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:37,747
We were gonna set up a stand
and try to sell it, but,

172
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:40,701
we needed some pony
to taste test it first.

173
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:41,802
Yup.

174
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,901
We thought you two
would be perfect together...

175
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:46,774
To test it...

176
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,150
...together.

177
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:52,873
So, we'll just leave you two alone...

178
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,110
Together, to test it.

179
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,962
I'm very sorry about this.

180
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:05,358
I mentioned to the girls that
I don't have a very special somepony.

181
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:08,167
And I believe they're putting us
in these awkward situations

182
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:11,029
because they've decided it should be you.

183
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,354
I suppose we should just
humor them for a moment.

184
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:20,440
This punch does look delicious.

185
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:21,449
Eeyup.

186
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:24,772
I think they're gonna drink it!

187
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:26,173
To good friends!

188
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:30,900
They're drinking it.
They're drinking it!

189
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,852
They're looking into each others' eyes.

190
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:44,614
They're about to be in
for a big surprise!

191
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,945
- Big Mac?
- Yup?

192
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:57,620
Will you be my very special somepony?

193
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,452
Eeyup.

194
00:10:58,627 --> 00:10:59,276
YES!

195
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:07,160
He's her special somepony.
She's his special somepony.

196
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:09,942
He's my special somepony.

197
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,917
Eeeeeya.

198
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,033
He's my shmoopy-doopy
sweedy-weedy pony pie.

199
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:25,098
You're my shmoopy-doopy
sweedy-weedy pony pie.

200
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:27,649
Did he just say...

201
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:35,920
You're my cutie-patootie
lovie-dovie honey-bunny.

202
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:40,506
You're my heartie-smartie
smirchy-wirchy baby-waby.

203
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:43,811
Big Mac!
Hey! Hello!

204
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:45,866
What's going on?

205
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:48,965
Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?

206
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:51,492
I have a special somepony.

207
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:55,663
A kissy-wissy
snuggy-wuggy sugar bear.

208
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:02,087
I think we may have given them
too big of a nudge.

209
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:06,015
You're my cuddly-wuddly
boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie.

210
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,516
Ya think?

211
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:11,583
What have we done?!

212
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:14,985
My brother's acting like
a grade-A goofball!

213
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:17,232
Maybe we added too much rainbow.

214
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:18,865
Or maybe not enough cloud.

215
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,591
Or maybe... Uh oh.

216
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,075
What do you mean "uh oh"?!

217
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,726
We might not have given Big Mac
and Miss Cheerilee a love potion...

218
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:30,744
We may have given them a love poison!

219
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:31,923
What?!?!

220
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:35,641
Apparently, some prince who
long time ago whipped up this recipe

221
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:37,612
and gave it to this princess he liked.

222
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:42,789
He meant it to be a love potion,
but things didn't turn out so well.

223
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,232
How "not so well" did things turn out?

224
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,097
Well, there's something here
about a dragon...

225
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:53,141
Kingdom falling...
Chaos reigning...

226
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:56,151
Okay, apparently it was all because
the prince and princess

227
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:59,361
were so lost in each others' eyes,
that they couldn't perform

228
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,750
their royal duties.

229
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,611
Great!

230
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:05,663
We've not only turned
Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee

231
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:07,957
into a couple of nonsense-spouting
nincompoops,

232
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,235
we may have put all of
Ponyville in jeopardy!

233
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,803
Come on, Apple Bloom.

234
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:19,017
Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
don't have any royal duties.

235
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,808
But they still got responsibilities.

236
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,198
If we don't fix this, Miss Cheerilee
won't be able to teach.

237
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:29,304
Big Mac won't be able to
harvest any apples.

238
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:31,088
And before you know it...

239
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:38,542
Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated
little ponies starving for apples.

240
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:41,055
It'll be chaos, it'll be chaos!

241
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:44,557
There's an antidote!

242
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,754
Well, why didn't you say so?

243
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:49,619
Didn't you see me gettin'
all panicked back there?

244
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,221
If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
from looking into each others' eyes

245
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:56,051
for one full hour,
the love curse will be broken.

246
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,401
Only an hour?

247
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:59,955
We can pull that off in a second.

248
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:04,274
You take the first sip,
snuggle-wuggles.

249
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:07,544
Nope, you take it, sugar lump.

250
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:09,307
No, you, shnooky-lumps.

251
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,725
No, you, pooky-pie.

252
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:14,454
I'm all for romance,
but this has been going on for hours.

253
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,669
What's happened to these two?

254
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,138
Who knows?

255
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:26,156
Well, these love birds will probably
be planning a wedding soon.

256
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,125
I can always use the catering business.

257
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,579
A wedding!
That's it!

258
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,292
Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
should get married!

259
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:37,208
How is gettin' hitched
gonna keep them apart?

260
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,811
They aren't really gonna get married.

261
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,899
They're just gonna get ready
to get married.

262
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:46,185
No you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!

263
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,759
Nope you, huggy-wuggy
snuggy bunny!

264
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,335
Hi Miss Cheerilee, how are you?

265
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:57,981
I have a very special somepony.

266
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,917
Yeah, we noticed.

267
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,707
Gosh, you two are so in love,

268
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,070
the next thing you know,
you'll be getting married.

269
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:11,581
Married?

270
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:15,186
That's right. Married.

271
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:16,782
Married.

272
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:23,405
'Course, if you're gonna get married,

273
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:26,168
you wanna pick out a really nice
diamond for your...

274
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:30,037
...shmoopy-doopy-pookie-pie.

275
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,038
Diamond!

276
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,192
Shmoopy!

277
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:37,103
Don't you think you should start
looking for your wedding dress?

278
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:43,059
You'll wanna look your best for your...
honey-bunny snuggle-baby.

279
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:46,113
Dress!

280
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,853
Now we just need to keep them apart.

281
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:53,162
I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied.

282
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:54,839
You two do the same with Big Mac.

283
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,320
No problem.

284
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,972
Meet me back at the clubhouse in an hour,
when this whole mess is over.

285
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,308
This one looks nice.

286
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:09,806
Better try it on now.

287
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,894
Ten minutes down,
fifty minutes to go.

288
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:28,721
No.

289
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:30,626
No.

290
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,901
Not that one either.

291
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:34,083
No.

292
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,258
Too... shiny.

293
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,475
No.

294
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:41,244
You know, something less... shiny.

295
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,151
Miss Cheerilee deserves the best.

296
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,821
How much time is left?

297
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:49,376
I'm running out of ways
to make diamonds sound bad.

298
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,166
We still have twenty five minutes.

299
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:55,746
Where's my brother?

300
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:58,470
He made his purchase
and departed out the back.

301
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:01,167
Said something about needing to see his...

302
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:02,800
...shmoopy-shmoop.

303
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:08,163
Okay, I'll see what I can do
to slow him down.

304
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:10,638
You go on to Carousel Boutique
and warn Sweetie Belle.

305
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,199
What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom?
Where's Big Mac?

306
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:46,904
On... his... way.

307
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:52,668
Gotta... keep him... out of Boutique.

308
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:28,245
Move away!

309
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:30,195
He'll get to her!

310
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,969
He's still strong!

311
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:36,200
Let him go!

312
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:40,999
Shmoopy-doo!

313
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,530
I sure am glad we found those shovels.

314
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:56,545
One more minute
and the spell will be broken!

315
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:58,826
Shmoopy-doo!

316
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,379
Sweetums?

317
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:12,366
Shmoopy-doo!

318
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:45,115
Please be normal, please be normal!

319
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:50,346
Am I wearing a wedding veil?

320
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:51,529
Eeyup.

321
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:55,834
Are you sitting on a feather bed,
in a hole in the ground?

322
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:57,060
Eeyup.

323
00:19:57,261 --> 00:20:02,020
Girls! Can you explain why I look like
I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?

324
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:06,907
We may have given you
the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion...

325
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:10,941
...that may have turned out
to actually be a love poison.

326
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:15,076
And you may have gone
just a teeny tiniest bit nutty.

327
00:20:15,077 --> 00:20:18,706
Well, we only did it because we thought
you and Big Mac would be really happy

328
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:22,680
if you could be each other's very special
someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.

329
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:26,391
Our hearts and hooves
were in the right place.

330
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,814
We appreciate that you care about us
and want us to be happy, but...

331
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:34,633
But no matter how good
our intentions might have been,

332
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,691
we shoulda never meddled
in your relationship.

333
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:41,241
Nopony can force two ponies
to be together.

334
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:46,137
It's up to everypony to choose that
very special somepony for themselves.

335
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:48,469
We're sorry.

336
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:52,197
And you can think about
how sorry you are

337
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:56,265
while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores
at Sweet Apple Acres.

338
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:59,639
Does that seem like
a fair punishment to you?

339
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,003
Eeyup.

340
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:11,493
Hey there, Miss Cheerilee!
What are you doing here?

341
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,696
Since you three are doing
all of his chores,

342
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:17,690
Big Mac and I thought we'd
have a picnic at the gazebo.

343
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:19,709
Ready, sugar bear?

344
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,823
Eeyup, pumpkin pie.

345
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:32,023
NOOO!!!
