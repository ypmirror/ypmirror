Don't you get it?

92
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:56,444
The new book is obviously
delayed because she needs help

93
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:59,186
dealing with whatever everyday
nonsense is distracting her

94

Ahuizotl has sought control
of the Tenochtitlan Basin

213
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:51,496
since Book 3.

214
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,723
True, but in Book 4,
she defeated Ahuizotl

215
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:56,762
and secured control of the
Amulet of Atonement,

216
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:59,287
dispelling the dark magic
of the Ketztwctl Empress

217
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:00,509
and thus protecting the basin

00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:01,996
with the Radiant
Shield of Razdon.

219
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,492
But the Radiant
Shield of Razdon

220
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,835
is vulnerable to the
dark enchantment

of the Rings of Scorchero.

222
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,959
But are you forgetting that
the rings were scattered

223
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,717
to the four corners of
Tenochtitlan,

224
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:11,845
thus rendering the dark
enchantment powerless?

225
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,993
Only if you assume that the
rings have yet to be retrieved

226
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,507
and the ring
Caballeron just stole

isn't the last to completely
restore the dark tower
