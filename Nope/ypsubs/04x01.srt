1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,620
You gotta really
flap 'em hard.

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,040
Whoa!

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,840
Uh, maybe not quite that hard.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,460
Whoa!

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,660
Looking good up there,
Princess Twilight.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,820
Applejack, you know you
don't have to call me that.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,520
Why do you protest so?

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,220
You've already given up
wearing your crown all the time,

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,980
the least you can do
is embrace your new title.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,280
If other ponies want to
address me that way,

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,200
I suppose it's fine. But...

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,780
not my friends.

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,940
It just doesn't
feel right.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,820
And neither does
all this flying business.

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,540
The Summer Sun Celebration
is only two days away

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,800
and I'm never going to be
ready to perform my part.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,720
Not if you spend all your
time down here you won't.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,080
Now get up there and show
everypony the big finish!

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,290
That's what
I'm talking about!

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,500
Waa-hoo!

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,420
Wow! That was a big finish!

22
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:45,698

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,900
You look amazing, darling.

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,940
They've really captured
your regality.

25
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,880
I suppose.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, don't be so modest.

27
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,720
<i>It's everypony's dream to</i>
<i>someday wear a crown</i>

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,480
<i>and have their coronation</i>
<i>ceremony preserved</i>

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,940
<i>in stained glass</i>
<i>for all to see.</i>

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,500
I don't know if it's
everypony's dream.

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,700
Most of my dreams
are about frosting.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,460
We'd better get going.

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,900
We don't want to
miss our train.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,140
Fluttershy's
right.

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,060
Don't know about y'all

36
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,180
but I've still got bushels
to do to get ready.

37
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,600
The official celebration
may be here in Canterlot

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,780
but whoo-wee! has the
Mayor put us in charge

39
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,960
of one heck of a
party back home.

40
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,180
Aw, don't look like
that, sugarcube.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,360
You get to be right there
with the other princesses

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,180
when Celestia
raises the sun.

43
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,920
And I'm honored.

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,100
Really I am.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,620
It's just that the
Summer Sun Celebration

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,360
is what first brought
all of us together.

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,660
It just doesn't feel right
not getting to spend

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,980
such a special day with
my Ponyville friends.

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,940
It doesn't feel right
to us either, darling.

50
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,100
If the Mayor wasn't
so desperate for our assistance,

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,540
we'd most certainly
stay here in Canterlot.

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
<i>And of course we</i>
<i>do understand</i>

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,620
<i>that your royal duties</i>
<i>must come first.</i>

54
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,140
The Summer Sun
Celebration

55
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,600
may have brought
us together,

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,160
but it's something
much bigger

57
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,020
that'll always
keep us connected.

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,920
Exhibit A.

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,220
The six of us are
united by the

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,360
Elements of Harmony.

61
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,520
No amount of "royal duties"
is gonna change that.

62
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,140
Right everypony?

63
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,880
Right, Pinkie Pie?

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,940
Creamy, creamy frosting.

65
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,540
You should take
that as a "yes".

66
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,920
<i>We're going to </i>
<i>write you</i>

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,120
and give you so
many details,

68
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,760
it'll be like you're in
Ponyville with us!

69
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Right, girls?

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,080
Cross my heart
and hope to fly.

71
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,200
Stick a cupcake in my eye.

72
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,560
<i>And you will be </i>
<i>with us</i>

73
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,100
right after the
celebration.

74
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,820
We already have an
appointment on the books

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
to discuss the royal
upgrades to your loft decor.

76
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,780
<i>All aboard for </i>
<i>Ponyville!</i>

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,700
Whee!

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,080
I can't help it, Spike.

79
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,560
They've only been
gone a minute

80
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,840
and I already feel like
I'm missing something.

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,520
For the Princess.

82
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,640
Dear Twilight, you
aren't missing anything.

83
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,200
Your friend, Pinkie Pie.

84
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
<i>That's me!</i>

85
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,860
<i>Whoo whee!</i>

86
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,220
But I am.

87
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,200
I just know it.

88
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,880
Check. Check. Check. Check.
And... check.

89
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,000
Huh. What do you know?

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
We're way ahead
of schedule.

91
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,780
I credit your extremely
competent assistant.

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,600
So do I.

93
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,520
The Celebration isn't
until the day

94
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,640
after tomorrow.

95
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,080
We could still fit in a
quick trip to Ponyville

96
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,400
and be back in
plenty of time

97
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,800
to finish off these last few
things before the main event.

98
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
That would be nice, Spike.

99
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,720
But what if something
else came up

100
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,500
while we were gone?

101
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,460
What if we were delayed
getting back

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,760
and I wasn't able to finish
everything on that list?

103
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,760
What if we lost the list
on the way to Ponyville

104
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,180
and then couldn't remember
which things we'd done

105
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,200
and which things
we hadn't done

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,680
and then spent so much
time trying to figure out

107
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,920
what we hadn't done
and what we had done

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,340
that we ruined the
entire celebration

109
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,640
by not doing the one
really important thing

110
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,720
that we were supposed to do?

111
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,340
that we were supposed to do?

112
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,040
Uh, so that's a "no", then?

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,820
These are the first royal
duties Princess Celestia

114
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,580
has given me.

115
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,620
I can't risk
letting her down.

116
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,040
<i>And I'm sure </i>
<i>you won't.</i>

117
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,660
Your Highness!

118
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,460
No need for that now,
Princess Twilight.

119
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,680
Sorry.

120
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,160
No need
to apologize.

121
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,280
Sorry.

122
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,500
I must admit that it is
wonderful to actually

123
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,480
be looking forward to the
Summer Sun Celebration.

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,740
What do you mean?

125
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,520
For my subjects it has
always been a celebration

126
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,880
of my defeat of Nightmare
Moon, but for me?

127
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,180
It was just a
terrible reminder

128
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
that I'd had to
banish my own sister.

129
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,400
I guess I'd never really
thought about it that way.

130
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,020
But now it has become a
wonderful reminder

131
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,180
of her transformation
back into Princess Luna

132
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,880
and our happy reunion.

133
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,560
I am so pleased that you
will be playing a role

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
in the festivities.

135
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,520
I know it must have
been difficult

136
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,060
to see your friends return
to Ponyville without you.

137
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,380
Maybe a little.

138
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,540
You may no longer
be my student,

139
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,580
Princess Twilight,

140
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,980
but I hope you know that
I will always be here

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
if you need me.

142
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,140
Just as I hope that you
will always be there

143
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,480
when I need you.

144
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,340
I think this guy
needs you.

145
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,240
A message for
Princess Twilight.

146
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,320
A letter from
Ponyville, I presume?

147
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,820
Never mind.

148
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,260
It's not important.

149
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,160
Spike, where were we?

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,880
About to call it a night?

151
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,880
We should probably go over
the checklist one more time.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,420
I knew you were
gonna say that.

153
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,260
I'll leave you to it.

154
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,820
Huh?

155
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,420
Spike?

156
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,820
Check. Check. Check. Check.

157
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,540
Spike!

158
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
What time is it?

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
It's the middle
of the night.

160
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,820
But it could
be morning.

161
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,600
That's just it.

162
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,280
I can't tell.

163
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,260
Whoa. That is weird!

164
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,440
Come on, Spike.

165
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,380
We have to find out
what's going on.

166
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,180
What do you
think it means?

167
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,920
Princess Twilight
will know.

168
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,860
I'm sure it's just...

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,340
There's certainly a logical...

170
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,880
Your Highness, you
must come with us.

171
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,980
It's Princess Luna and
Princess Celestia.

172
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,960
They're gone!

173
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,200
<i>But I don't understand. </i>
<i>Where are they?</i>

174
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,220
We don't know.

175
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,780
It seems that Princess
Celestia and Princess Luna

176
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
have simply...

177
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,460
... <i>vanished</i> .

178
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
Vanished!

179
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,700
This is why we
have come to you.

180
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,880
We await your command.

181
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,980
My command?

182
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,500
We're officers of
the Royal Guard.

183
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,600
We take our orders
from royalty.

184
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,540
With Princess Luna and
Princess Celestia gone

185
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,160
and Princess Cadance
overseeing

186
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,600
the Crystal Empire now,

187
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,520
that means we take our
orders from you.

188
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,700
<i>Princess Twilight, there</i>
<i>is no time to waste.</i>

189
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
<i>We need to know what</i>
<i>you want us to do.</i>

190
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,260
I want you to continue the
search for Princess Luna

191
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,400
and Princess Celestia.

192
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,020
We have to find them
before ponies start to panic.

193
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,430
There must be some clue
that can tell us

194
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,080
what's happened to them.

195
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,020
If you find
something, anything,

196
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,670
<i>let me know immediately.</i>

197
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,650
Way to take
charge, Twilight.

198
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,260
Your Highness, news
from Ponyville.

199
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,490
The Everfree Forest
appears to be, well...

200
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,350
...invading!

201
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,070
<i>Excuse me. </i>
<i>Pardon me.</i>

202
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,800
Are you all right?

203
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,780
My goodness, what is it
that has caused you all

204
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,070
such distress?

205
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,470
Whatever it is, I'm
sure it's nothing

206
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,210
you need to really
worry about.

207
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,290
No. You were right.

208
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,330
You should be worried.

209
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,080
Very, very worried.

210
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,000
<i>Come on, y'all,</i>
<i>put your backs into it.</i>

211
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,670
Eeyup.

212
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,340
Nnope.

213
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,620
Eeyup.

214
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,010
Nnope.

215
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,430
Eeyup.

216
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,860
Nnope.

217
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,800
Dagnabit! We ain't never
seen this kind of trouble

218
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,990
with weeds before.

219
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,390
Now that I think about it.

220
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,560
I've never even seen these
kind of weeds at all!

221
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,830
Have y'all?

222
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,260
Nnope.

223
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,260
Where the heck are these
things comin' from?

224
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,640
And what in tarnation is
going on with the sky?

225
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,020
<i>Oh, no you don't.</i>

226
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,010
This is Ponvyille
territory.

227
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,470
And we aren't due
for rain until

228
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,520
after the Summer Sun
Celebration.

229
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,340
You Everfree clouds need
to just head on back

230
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,580
to where you belong.

231
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,130
Whoa!

232
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,860
Gonna make me do this
the hard way, huh?

233
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,180
Hey!

234
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,340
Hm. Something strange
about the sky.

235
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,920
What in the name of calming
chamomile is going on?

236
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,640
Opal Essence,
darling, I'm so sorry.

237
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,280
I promise I'm not doing
this on purpose.

238
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,000
It wasn't me.

239
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,950
I swear.

240
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,330
Sweetie Belle, if this is
some sort of prank

241
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,170
you and your little Crusader
friends are pulling,

242
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,090
I find very little
humor in it.

243
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,060
<i>Rarity! You have to </i>
<i>help me.</i>

244
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,310
I think something's
wrong with my horn.

245
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,950
Where are we going?

246
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,000
The Everfree Forest
is ... invading.

247
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,270
Whatever is going on,

248
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,700
I'm sure we're going
to need our friends

249
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,950
and the Elements of
Harmony to stop it.

250
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,850
I just hope we haven't
missed the train.

251
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,950
Uh, Twilight, there
is another way for us

252
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,700
to get to Ponyville, remember?

253
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,280
There is?

254
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,600
You can fly.

255
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,230
Oh. Right.

256
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,870
Whoa!

257
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,450
Something very
strange is going on and--

258
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,360
I for one would
appreciate an explanation.

259
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,700
All I know is the
sky's split in two

260
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,800
and these clouds moving in
sure aren't from around here.

261
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,170
<i>Neither are all</i>
<i>these crazy plants.</i>

262
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,940
They're comin' from
the Everfree Forest.

263
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,300
And try as we might,
us Earth Ponies

264
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,000
can't do anything
to get rid of 'em.

265
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,760
Don't suppose you
know any magic

266
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,320
that might stop 'em
from spreadin'?

267
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,280
Alas, this whole "raging
forest" situation

268
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,170
seems to have left my
horn on the fritz.

269
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,200
We have to figure
out something.

270
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,580
I don't know how
much more of this

271
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,860
Ponyville can take.

272
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,950
I don't know how
much more I can take.

273
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,990
<i>The Forest is
expandin', y'all.</i>

274
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,920
And judgin' by how
fast it's movin',

275
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,850
it doesn't seem content just
takin' over Ponyville.

276
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,240
I reckon before long, it'll
cover half of Equestria.

277
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,590
Whoa!

278
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,170
I'm starting to wish
we'd taken the train!

279
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,320
Almost there.

280
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,130
Come on, Spike.

281
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,870
We need to get the
Elements of Harmony

282
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,030
and find the others.

283
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,180
Incoming!

284
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,810
Whoa!

285
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,930
Oh, thank goodness.

286
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,040
Oh, I hope you know we
wouldn't normally

287
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,730
go through your books
without permission.

288
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,600
Sweet ground.

289
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,410
Sweet, sweet,
wonderful ground.

290
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,220
OK, I get it!

291
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,900
I need to work
on my flying.

292
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,280
I don't know if
you've noticed,

293
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,900
but the Everfree Forest is
just a teeny-tiny bit

294
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,870
out of control.

295
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
Guess it turned out you
were missing something

296
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,820
here in Ponyville
after all.

297
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,850
But perhaps you
already know

298
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,630
what's causing all
of this calamity?

299
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,000
Has Princess Celestia
sent you to dispel it

300
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,760
post haste?

301
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,860
Not exactly.

302
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,520
You see, Princess
Celestia is,

303
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,820
well, she and Princess
Luna are both...

304
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,510
They're missing!

305
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,100
I don't know who
has taken them.

306
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,660
But I've got a hunch
we're going to need

307
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,700
the Elements of Harmony
to get them back.

308
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,330
Oh yeah.

309
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,050
Just like old times.

310
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,320
Aaa-boo-yah!

311
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,320
I told you we'd always be
connected by the Elements.

312
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,890
Now we just gotta
figure out who to aim

313
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,770
these bad boys at so we can
get Celestia and Luna back

314
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,670
and keep the rest of Equestria
from becoming plant food.

315
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,080
Any ideas?

316
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,190
Hmmm.

317
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,420
<i>I haven't found squat</i>
<i>in any of the books</i>

318
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,510
<i>I've been looking through.</i>

319
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,660
Oopies. Missed a spot.

320
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,040
Half-day. Half-night.

321
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,900
Strange weather patterns.

322
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,670
Out of control plants.

323
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,170
I think I'm starting to
get a pretty good idea

324
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,300
of who we're up against.

325
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,630
Winter wrap up.

326
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,630
Winter wrap up-- Ooooh!

327
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,000
Ho ho! Now Twilight,
you know Princess Celestia

328
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,840
said that you were to
give me a heads-up

329
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,600
before you summoned me with
that little spell she gave you.

330
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,330
In case you
haven't noticed,

331
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,690
I was in the middle of
a particularly

332
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,730
invigorating shower.

333
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,050
Enough!

334
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,670
Release Princess Celestia
and Princess Luna

335
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,000
and stop the Everfree
Forest from invading!

336
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,830
Why whatever are
you talking about?

337
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,580
Don't you play dumb
with us, Discord.

338
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,630
We know you're the one
behind all of this.

339
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,560
Don't get me wrong, I
absolutely LOVE

340
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,840
what you've done
with the place,

341
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,110
but I couldn't possibly
take responsibility.

342
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm reformed.

343
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,740
Don't you remember?

344
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,610
Yeah. Right.

345
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,080
This has got your cloven
hoof-prints all over it.

346
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,210
I'll have you know that I
have only one cloven hoof.

347
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,630
Such accusations.

348
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,170
And here I thought
we were friends.

349
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,400
Drop the act, Buster!
We're onto you.

350
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,360
<i>Ladies, ladie,</i>
<i>I'm innocent.</i>

351
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,370
Would I lie to you?

352
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,710
<i>Yes!</i>

353
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,260
<i>Um? Maybe?</i>

354
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,160
Well, then, it seems
we've reached an impasse.

355
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,960
I'm telling the truth,
but you think I'm lying.

356
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,460
What do friends like us do
in a situation like this,

357
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,670
Princess Twilight?

358
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,270
Congrats by the way
on the promotion.

359
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,440
You totally deserve it.

360
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,250
I say we blast
him back to stone.

361
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,450
Works for me.

362
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,520
Here! Here!

363
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,320
Hey! We can't do that.

364
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,410
What if he really is
telling the truth?

365
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,500
Well, finally!

366
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,840
Somepony willing to give me
the benefit of the doubt.

367
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,410
The rest of you could
learn a lot about

368
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,840
friendship from my dear
friend, Shutterfly here.

369
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
Um, it's Fluttershy.

370
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,470
Oh, right. Whatever.

371
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,900
If you're not the
one responsible,

372
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,740
then help us
figure out who is.

373
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,880
I suppose I could,

374
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:48,930
but after all the hoof-pointing
and besmirching

375
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,100
of my good name, I just
don't know if I'm up to it.

376
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,240
Why don't you ask
your zebra friend

377
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:58,260
if she knows anything?
Why don't you ask
your zebra friend

378
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,550
if she knows anything?

379
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,660
Zecora!

380
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,320
From my home,
I've had to flee.

381
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,920
The forest has grown
too wild even for me.

382
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,230
Any idea why all
this is happenin'?

383
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,580
I'm afraid it is a
mystery to me as well.

384
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,700
But I may have
something that,

385
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,630
if combined with a spell...

386
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,460
<i>I do not dare</i>
<i>to use it myself.</i>

387
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,400
<i>The results</i>
<i>would be tragic.</i>

388
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,600
It only responds
to alicorn magic.

389
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,330
Princess Twilight, you
can turn the potion

390
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,920
from purple to white.

391
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,340
After a sip you may see
why the sky is day

392
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,770
<u>and</u> night.

393
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,550
Oooohhh!

394
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,050
Doesn't seem to be work--

395
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,710
Where am I?

396
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,030
Not another step.

397
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,950
Princess Luna!

398
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,390
I don't understand.

399
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,580
Where are we?

400
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,880
Why did you and
Celestia disappear?

401
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,270
Did you really expect me
to sit idly by

402
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,400
while they all basked in
your "precious light"?

403
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,790
"Precious light"?

404
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,230
There can only be one
Princess in Equestria.

405
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,080
And that Princess
will be me!
