1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,160
TWILIGHT: You wanted to see me?
To give me a test?

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,520
CELESTIA:
The Crystal Empire has returned.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,740
You want me to help protect
an entire empire?

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,050
It must be you, and you alone.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,360
<i>TWILIGHT SPARKLE:
But, what if I fail?</i>

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,040
Let's just say the empire...

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,700
isn't the only thing that's returned.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,700
Go, go!

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,710
PINKIE:
Sparklriffic!

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,770
With Cadance putting all her strength
into keeping her spell going,

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,670
and me trying to keep an eye
on signs of trouble in the arctic,

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,250
we haven't been able to gather
much information from the Crystal Ponies.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,670
There are Crystal Ponies?!

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,000
I wish I could help you.

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,010
But I can't seem to remember anything
before King Sombra came to power.

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,680
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:
History of the Crystal Empire.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,150
The last page of the book mentioned
a crystal heart as the fair's centerpiece,

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,100
so I used my magic to cut one
out of a crystal block.

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,140
The whole purpose of the Crystal Fair
is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies,

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,090
so the light within them
can power the Crystal Heart,

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,740
so that the empire can be protected!

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,110
I think we may have
a problem...

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,200
I didn't know it was an actual relic!

24
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,950
It's alright, Twilight.

25
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,830
( creature howling distantly )
Twilie...

26
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:18,995
( opening theme song playing )

00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,330

00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:55,505
( ominous theme playing )

31
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,355
( croaks )

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,460
The empire is under attack.

33
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,379
( roars )

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,300
I have to find the Crystal Heart!

35
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,640
TWILIGHT:
No, you stay here with Cadance.

36
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,600
She needs you, Shining Armor.

37
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,130
I'll retrieve the Heart.

38
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,540
Let's do this.

39
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,830
I've been trying to figure out
how I'm meant to pass Celestia's test.

40
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,300
Retrieving the Crystal Heart must be it.

41
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,200
But there is something else you can do.

42
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,150
Name it.

43
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,890
You and the rest of our friends
have to keep the fair going.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,120
What? With that thing
moving into the empire?!

45
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,750
The whole purpose of the Crystal Fair
is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies,

46
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,750
so they can activate the Crystal Heart.

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,130
Yeah, and?

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,100
If the Crystal Ponies find out King Sombra
is trying to take over the empire again,

49
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,950
their spirits are gonna be
anything but lifted.

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,470
It won't matter if I find the Crystal Heart.
They won't be able to make it work.

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,020
You have to keep them happy
here at the fair.

52
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,240
Keep the fair going and
the Crystal Ponies' spirits high.

53
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,950
Done and done.

54
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,250
SHINING ARMOR:
Twilie, be careful.

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
I will.

56
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:25,099
( croaking )

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,100
( calliope music playing )

58
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,250
Okay, here's...
( whispering inaudibly )

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,451
Huh?

60
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,960
I just found out they're offering
face painting for the little ones.

61
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,399
( whispers )
Uh-huh, we can do that.

62
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:01,530
Twilight's doing what?!

63
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:07,370
He... really... loves
getting his face painted.

64
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,671
( laughs nervously )

65
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,480
Who wants a flugelhorn?

66
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,380
I want a flugelhorn!

67
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,370
Who else wants a flugelhorn?

68
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,630
I want a flugelhorn!!

69
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,730
SPIKE:
Twilight, wait!

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,570
I'm coming with you!

71
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,390
You can't. I have to retrieve
the Crystal Heart by myself.

72
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,530
I know. I promise
I won't lift a claw to help you.

73
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,290
Not a claw, Spike.

74
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,450
SPIKE:
Where are we going, exactly?

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,540
TWILIGHT: I think I might know where
King Sombra hid the Crystal Heart.

76
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,040
SPIKE:
The castle?

77
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,460
The king would've been
counting on the fact

78
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,150
that nopony would dare
come looking for it here.

79
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,040
They'd've been too afraid to even try.

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
SPIKE:
I hope you're right.

81
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,670
You and me both.

82
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,500
What are you lookin' at?!

83
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,720
That's what I thought!

84
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,530
Uh, Rainbow Dash?

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,850
We're supposed to be actin'
like nothing's wrong.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,100
Exactly!

87
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,590
APPLEJACK: What I mean is,
maybe you should let me

88
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,880
keep the Crystal Ponies away
from the fake heart,

89
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,480
while you show off
your joustin' skills.

90
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,150
Seeing my awesomeness does have a way
of putting ponies into a pretty good mood.

91
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:35,099
( sheep bleating )

92
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,650
- Come on, Knight Fluttershy.
- Huh?!

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,430
It's showtime.

94
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,650
How are y'all feelin'?
Havin' a good time?

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
The best I've had
in over a thousand years!

96
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,590
That's good! Gotta renew
that spirit of love and unity

97
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,130
if you're gonna power up
that Crystal Heart, right?

98
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,950
I sure would like to see it
before the ceremony.

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,820
It's been such a long time.

100
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,600
Oh, I hear ya, but,
uh... phew!

101
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,790
I'm gettin' a little toasty out here.

102
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,370
Bet you'd like to cool off
with a little Crystal Empire nectar!

103
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,670
Uh, you tried
the Crystal Empire fritters yet?

104
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,030
Made from a traditional
Crystal Empire recipe!

105
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,600
You're gonna love 'em!

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,230
I hear there's a joustin' match
about to start!

107
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,900
You don't wanna miss that!

108
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,110
Come on, Twilight... these Crystal Ponies
are more curious than a cat!

109
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:33,775
( panting )

110
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:34,973
Huh?

111
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:36,539
( sighs )

112
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,750
It's gotta be here somewhere.
It's just gotta be!

113
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,080
Not a claw, Spike.

114
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,342
( laughs nervously )

115
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:49,940
Celestia's orders!

116
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,570
<i>CELESTIA: If the empire is filled
with hope and love,</i>

117
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,630
<i>those things are reflected
across all of Equestria.</i>

118
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,610
<i>If hatred and fear take hold...</i>

119
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,290
Of course!

120
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,891
( grunts )

121
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,190
- What? Did you find it?!
- No!

122
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,190
Because this isn't
King Sombra's castle.

123
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,320
SPIKE: Isn't this where he lived
when he was in power?

124
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,620
It is. But it didn't look like this.

125
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:27,400
( grunts )

126
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,433
SPIKE: 
Whoa.

127
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,250
When did you learn to do that?

128
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,630
That was a little trick
Celestia taught me.

129
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:44,952
( gulps )

130
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,758
( whimpers )

131
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,580
You stay here.

132
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,720
If you insist.

133
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,780
Can you see what's down there yet?

134
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,980
Not yet. I can't even tell
how far down this goes!

135
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:07,300
( crystal clinks )

136
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,750
- Spike?
- SPIKE: Yeah?

137
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,680
TWILIGHT: 
Can you see outside?

138
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:26,681
( thunder crashing )

139
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,750
<i>Yes... crystals... </i>

140
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,370
It's not good! Cadance's magic
must be fading faster than before!

141
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,774
( suspenseful theme playing )

142
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,129
( grunts )

143
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,450
SPIKE : 
Twilight? Are you okay?

144
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,250
Yes...

145
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,250
What in the...

146
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,090
Stop...

147
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,260
moving!

148
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,440
Spike, I think it's here!

149
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,450
What are you doing here?

150
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,020
I don't know!
I opened the door and--

151
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,570
And now you must go.

152
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,210
Go where?

153
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,780
Doesn't matter to me.
You failed the test, Twilight!

154
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,270
I don't understand! The test--

155
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,590
Not only will you not move on
to the next level of your studies,

156
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,500
you won't continue your studies at all!

157
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,360
You didn't say anything about
no longer being your student if I failed!

158
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,640
Didn't I?

159
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,250
But... what do I do now?!

160
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,451
( evil laugh )

161
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,990
<i>SPIKE:

<i>SPIKE:
Twilight?</i>

SPIKE: 
Twiliiiight!

165
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,640
I know you told me to stay up there,

166
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,850
but you were down here
for such a long time

167
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,630
and you weren't answering
and I got worried so I came down here,

168
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,000
and you were just
staring at that wall...

169
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,550
I was calling your name, but I couldn't
seem to get your attention, and...

170
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,050
What were you looking at?
I mean... it's just a wall.

171
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,590
Ponyville?!

172
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,310
How did I get...

173
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,200
No! I don't wanna go!

174
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,700
Please, Twilight, don't leave me!

175
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,701
( door slams )

176
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,370
King Sombra's dark magic.
A doorway that leads to your worst fear.

177
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,250
We were home... you told me
you didn't need me any more.

178
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,150
You were sending me away...

179
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,150
A fear that will never come to pass.
I'm never gonna send you away.

180
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,550
And I'm not gonna fail my test!

181
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,650
SPIKE:
What's in there?

182
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:07,550
( sighs )

183
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,750
Stairs.

184
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,710
Lots and lots of stairs.

185
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,310
Maybe you should come
with me this time.

186
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,300
( uplifting theme playing )

187
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:25,588
( thunder rumbling )

188
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:32,813

( whimpering )

191
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:50,894

CROWD: Woo! Rainbow Dash!

192

CRYSTAL PONY:
Bravo, knight Rainbow Dash!

196
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,525
( whimpers )

197
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,950
Isn't there...
somepony else who could...

198
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,320
take over the jousting demonstration
with you?

199
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,450
The fate of an entire empire rests on us
showing these ponies a good time.

200
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,500
But, y'know,
if that isn't important to you...

201
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:27,640
( sobs )

202
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,500
Okay, okay,
I'll take it easy on you next time.

203
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,170
But not too easy.

204
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,550
I've got a reputation to maintain!

205
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:42,256
( panting heavily )

206
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,470
What if this is just more of his magic?

207
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,020
He makes a door that links
to your worst nightmare...

208
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,650
why not a staircase
that goes on forever?

209
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
Hold on to me.

210
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,130
Uh...

211
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:10,694
TWILIGHT:
Whoa! Yah!

212
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:21,070
( ponies whimpering )

213
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:26,068
RARITY: ( laughs nervously )
Excuse me. Pardon me.

214
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,650
I am running out of weaving materials
for the traditional crafts booths!

215
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,230
I've just made a hat out of
three pieces of hay and a drinking straw!

216
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,450
I made it work. But still!

217
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,280
We gotta do everything we can
to keep this thing goin'.

218
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,280
The Princess isn't lookin' so good.

219
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,500
I can imagine her magic
is gonna last much longer.

220
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,370
It's gonna be fine.

221
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,380
These ponies are gonna power up
that Crystal Heart when the time comes,

222
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,800
and we won't be needin'
her magic anyway.

223
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,850
PINKIE: I sure hope that time comes soon!
Even I can't keep this party going forever!

224
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,360
This isn't the Crystal Heart.

225
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,440
Oh, of course it isn't.

226
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,520
- The real one is--
- On its way!

227
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,400
I was going to say 'being polished'
to buy us some more time?

228
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,330
Oops.

229
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:26,081
( King Sombra laughing )
CRYSTAL PONIES: It's him!

230
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,250
<i>KING SOMBRA:

231

TWILIGHT: Whoa!
( laughs )

232
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,760
I actually studied gravity spells,
thinking it might be on our test!

233
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,760
Turns out I was prepared for this!

234
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:41,554
TWILIGHT: Wooo-hoo!
( laughs )

235
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:57,408
( alarm sounds )

236
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,409
( growls )

237
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:06,431

( thunder crashing )
( wind howling )

239
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,500
The Heart...
where's the Crystal--

240
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,160
Here! It rolled over to me
when you dropped it!

241
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,380
Don't move!

242
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,950
You can move, just not toward me!

243
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,650
How could I have been so foolish...?

244
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,430
I was just so eager to get it!

245
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,860
Then when I saw what
was going on outside, I...

246
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,690
SPIKE:
You have to get out of there, Twilight!

247
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,990
You have to be the one who brings
the Crystal Heart to Princess Cadance!

248
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,990
If you don't,
you'll fail Celestia's test!

249
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,870
King Sombra is already attacking
the Empire.

250
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,550
He could reach the Crystal Ponies
at any moment...

251
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,450
reach Princess Cadance,
my brother, my friends...

252
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,700
There may not be enough time for me
to find a way to escape.

253
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,390
You have to be the one
to bring the Crystal Heart to the fair.

254
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,100
Me? But Twilight--

255
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,260
Go.
Go!

256
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,430
( ponies whimpering and screaming )

257
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,940
APPLEJACK: Don't y'all worry
your pretty little crystal heads!

258
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,150
The real Crystal Heart
will be here any second!

259
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,250
I don't know if they believe you...

260
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,700
Don't know if I believe me...

261
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,952
( gasps )

262
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,760
He's back! I can't take it!

263
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:35,461
( screams )
Uh!

264
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,090
King Sombra...

265

( grunts )

268
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,140
- Hey! Up here!
- Spike?

269
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,720
I got the Crystal Heart!

270
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,920
<i>That is mine! </i>

00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,674
KING SOMBRA: 
Huh?

274
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:30,395
CRYSTAL PONY:
Who is that?

275
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:32,890
Behold! The Crystal Princess!

276
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,200
The Crystal Heart has returned.

277
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,750
Use the light and love within you
to ensure that King Sombra does not.

278
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,760
<i>What?
No... No! Stop! </i>

279
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:08,700

Ooh! ( laughs )

( all cheering )

284
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,300
( sighs )
Good job, Spike.

285
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,240
RARITY:
I do so wish it was permanent.

286
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,000
Did you see how
my mane just absolutely sparkled?

287
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,050
But... good things are better
when they're a rarity.

288
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,651
Oh! 
( giggles )

289
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,030
SHINING ARMOR:
Everything's gonna be okay.

290
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,750
You've gotta stop saving my rump like this,
it's starting to get embarrassing.

291
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,380
Wasn't me who saved you in the end.
It was Spike.

292
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,400
It's just a test.
Maybe she'll let you retake it.

293
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,990
I don't think she's gonna
give me a new test.

294
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,980
Keep it together, buddy...
gotta stay strong... for Twilight...

295
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,680
It's beautiful.

296
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,470
I wish it had been me
who ultimately made it so.

297
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,300
But it wasn't.

298
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,360
Twilight,
as I understand it,

299
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,690
Spike brought Princess Cadance
the Crystal Heart

300
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,650
because you weren't sure how quickly
you could find a way to escape the tower.

301
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,150
You weren't willing to risk the future
of the citizens of the Crystal Empire

302
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,160
in an effort to guarantee your own.

303
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,200
Far better that I have a student who
understands the meaning of self-sacrifice

304
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,500
than one who only looks out
for her own best interests.

305
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,950
Does this mean...?

306
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,900
She's totally gonna lose it!

307
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,150
Keep it together, buddy...
gotta stay strong... for Twilight...!

308
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
I passed!

<i>You were prepared to do your best </i>

<i>Had what it takes to pass the test </i>

312
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,810
<i>All those doubts you can dismiss </i>

313

<i>Turns out
you were prepared for this! </i>

314
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,550

315
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,920
<i>To pass the test with such high stakes </i>

316
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,470
<i>We knew for sure you would prevail </i>
