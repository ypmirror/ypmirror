1
00:00:03,287 --> 00:00:08,930
OK. Library... library... Where
did they put the library?

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,498
This Castle looked a lot
smaller from the outside.

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,755
Morning, Starlight.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,701
Whoops!

5
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:27,810
Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still
trying to find my way around.

6
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,596
You don't happen to know
where the library is, do you?

7
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:32,174
Next door on the left.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,527
Oh. Thanks.

9
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:39,236
Acceptance, mm-hmm,
Altruism, definitely.

10
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,941
Starlight! Good
morning! Come in!

11
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,552
Sorry I'm late. I got
a little turned around.

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,520
I still can't believe you're
letting me stay here.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,025
As your pupil. After
everything I did.

14
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:55,170
Well, I'm not one to dwell on
the past and neither should you.

15
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:59,083
The castle is your home now and
as far as being my pupil goes...

16
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,552
I was just trying to figure out

17
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:02,414
what your first friendship
lesson should be!

18
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,520
Oh. Well, it looks like you're
really narrowing it down.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
Oh, these are just the As. After
this, I move on to the Bs!

20

21
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,629
I know I'm just learning
about friendship,

22
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:58,727
but I didn't think there were
this many lessons for anything.

23
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,305
How do we choose?

24
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,163
Maybe I should pare things down
a bit before we go through them.

25
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,920
Why don't you join the
others in the throne room?

26
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:07,912
They're planning our trip
to the Crystal Empire

27
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:10,763
when Shining Armor and Princess
Cadance have their baby.

28
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:12,247
Throne room. Got it!

29
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:17,003
Um, which way is
the throne room?

30
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:21,803
Well, I think we should leave ASAP!

31
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,294
I don't want to miss
the Crystalling!

32
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:26,530
But, um, shouldn't we
wait for the invitation?

33
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:29,418
Frankly, I'm not exactly
clear on all the customs

34
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,243
and traditions of
the Crystal Empire.

35
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,505
Especially when it
comes to a Crystalling.

36
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:34,981
What's a Crystalling?

37
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,301
Well, that's just
it, Darling.

38
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,530
Princess Cadance and Shining
Armor's baby is due any day

39
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:42,429
and we're still not sure.

40
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:45,730
The Crystal Empire was
gone for a thousand years.

41
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:48,589
A lot of their customs
are a bit murky.

42
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:51,280
We know it's got something
to do with the new baby.

43
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:52,283
And a party!

44
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,905
And the Crystal Heart.

45
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:55,054
And a party!

46
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,207
And some kind of cool energy.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,480
And...

48
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,152
A PARTY!

49
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,472
It's not hard
to understand.

50
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:06,909
Most things in the
Crystal Empire aren't.

51
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:11,032
Like how I'm a big hero
there, for example.

52
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:18,705
Plus, I've had to help Twilight

53
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,261
do a lot of research
on Crystallings.

54
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,890
Whenever a baby is born
in the Crystal Empire,

55
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,181
the parents bring it
before the Crystal Heart.

56
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:29,047
They get the purest shard
of crystal they can find,

57
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,505
then pick a Crystaller
to present the baby

58
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:33,141
to everypony who comes.

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,247
Then they all share the
light and joy they feel,

60
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:38,785
feeding it into the crystal
that joins with the Heart

61
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,603
and increases its power.

62
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:43,600
And this is going to
be a Royal Crystalling,

63
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,941
so pretty much the whole
Empire will show up.

64
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,978
That hasn't happened
in a millennia.

65
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:52,203
What do you mean it increases
the Crystal Heart's power?

66
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:55,112
The energy it uses to protect
the Crystal Empire, I guess.

67
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,829
Protect it from what?

68
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:59,452
I didn't help Twilight
with that part.

69
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,612
Hey, Twilight, can
I ask you something

70
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,738
about the Crystal Empire?

71
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,083
Ha! Funny you
should mention it...

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,335
Because I just narrowed your
first friendship lesson

73
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:16,387
down to three options.

74
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,670
And one of them is in
the Crystal Empire.

75
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:19,852
Really?

76
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:22,227
I found out that's
where the first pony

77
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:23,520
you ever cared about lives!

78
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:24,941
Sunburst?

79
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,978
Of course that's just one idea.

80
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:28,603
We could also go to
Griffinstone.

81
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:31,470
Making friends with a Griffin
is a challenge all by itself.

82
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,507
Or we could tag
along with the CMCs

83
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,286
the next time they help a
pony who can't figure out

84
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,864
Starlight, is something wrong?

85
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:43,612
What? Oh, no. Those
all sound great.

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,563
I know! I guess you
were right.

87
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,581
It is going to be
hard to choose one.

88
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,990
Yeah.

89
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,867
Ugh! I am never going to find
my way around this place!

90
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,040
Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?

91
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,720
I don't know, Spike.

92
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:13,612
Twilight's figuring out what
my first friendship lesson is

93
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,064
and I guess I'm not exactly
thrilled with the options.

94
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:19,544
Well, with one of them.

95
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:20,609
Which one?

96
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,864
Reuniting me with
my first friend.

97
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,160
What's so terrible about that?

98
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:32,455
When we were foals,

99
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:35,636
Sunburst knew everything there
was to know about magic.

100
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,476
He always knew just what to do.

101
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:58,418
And he was always
there to help me.

102
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,556
I guess it's not surprising that
Sunburst got his cutie mark

103
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:15,230
in magic and went off to
Princess Celestia's school.

104
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,169
But when he left...

105
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,643
You blamed cutie marks and
stripped a whole village

106
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,249
of theirs and when Twilight
and the others stopped you,

107
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,341
you went back in time and
almost destroyed Equestria.

108
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:28,289
Not really stuff I'm super
eager to tell Sunburst about.

109
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:32,209
I mean, he's probably some
big, important wizard now

110
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:36,006
and I can't even find my way
around Twilight's Castle.

111
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,781
Well, if Sunburst is
that good at magic,

112
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,036
maybe he'd appreciate
your exploits.

113
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,298
You should talk to
Twilight about it.

114
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:47,735
I'm sure she'd want to
hear what you have to say.

115
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:51,624
I know, but I don't want her to
think I'm not ready to learn

116
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:54,535
or that I'm not grateful
for everything she's doing.

117
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,363
SPIKE! COME QUICK!

118
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:08,916
It's a Crystalling invitation!

119
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:12,443
Shining Armor's a
father! I'm an Aunt!

120
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,584
Well, this settles it.

121
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:16,603
Since we're going to
the Crystal Empire,

122
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,886
your first friendship
lesson is going to be

123
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:21,341
reuniting with Sunburst!

124
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,538
Great.

125
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:44,523
Um, Applejack, what is that?

126
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,849
Oh, just a little
something for the young'un.

127
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:51,212
Made from genuine Sweet
Apple Acres apple trees.

128
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,966
We make 'em for all the Apples

129
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:56,338
and anypony related to Twilight
is practically family.

130
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:03,427
Yeah. It's OK, but it's no
Cloudsdale Mobile...BAM!

131
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:06,092
Oooh! Pretty!

132
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:10,701
Well, a mobile is real nice...

133
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,012
as long as you have something to
lay in so you can look at it.

134
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:17,144
And a fetching blanket
to keep you warm.

135
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,110
I'm sure Shining Armor
and Princess Cadance

136
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,898
will love all our gifts, but
I think they're more happy

137
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,892
we'll be attending the
baby's Crystalling.

138
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,550
Ooh! I can't wait to see
all that light and love

139
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:30,504
make the Crystal Heart even
more sparkly and shiny!

140
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,676
Actually, Pinkie,
the Crystal Heart

141
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,652
is an ancient and
powerful relic.

142
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,996
Without its magic, the
Crystal Empire would be lost

143
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:37,981
to the Frozen North.

144
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:42,289
Wow. This Crystalling
sounds pretty important.

145
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:45,883
I'd understand if you
wanted to, you know,

146
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,676
wait to do a different
friendship lesson

147
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,846
when we get back.

148
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:52,449
Are you kidding?
This trip is perfect.

149
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,698
Not only do I get to see the
baby and take part in a ceremony

150
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,895
that helps maintain the
magic of the Crystal Empire,

151
00:08:58,098 --> 00:08:59,870
but I'm starting
my new pupil off

152
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:03,581
with the most amazing friendship
lesson ever. I can't wait!

153
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:07,526
Right. Me neither.

154
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,283
Actually, Twilight,
I am a little worried

155
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:15,760
about meeting Sunburst.

156
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,292
Oh, trust me, I know what
it's like to see old friends,

157
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,360
but I'll be right there
to help things along.

158
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,129
I've broken the whole lesson
down into a few easy steps

159
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,707
to ensure this reunion
goes off without a hitch.

160
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,735
Step one, head to Sunburst's
house and get you two started

161
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:38,775
on the right hoof.

162
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:42,166
Step two, get to the Castle with
enough time to visit the baby.

163
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,535
Shining Armor!

164
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,424
Twilight!

165
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:48,547
I didn't know you
were meeting us.

166
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:52,578
Of course I am. It's me.
Right here. Here I am.

167
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,609
Why wouldn't I come
meet my sister?

168
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,584
Though we have met before.

169
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,480
Are you all right?

170
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:02,098
Never better! Being a father
is amazing and wonderful

171
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:05,384
and amazing and
confusing and amazing...

172
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,261
But surprising too, you know?

173
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:11,126
I mean, not that you'd know. You
wouldn't know, I know. You know?

174
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,443
Sorry. I haven't really slept
since Cadence had the baby.

175
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,680
Come to think of it,
she hasn't either.

176
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,858
It sure would be
great to get a break.

177
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:25,489
Oh. Of course. I don't
know what I was thinking.

178
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:27,735
You two probably need
all kinds of help!

179
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,584
I'm sorry, Starlight,
but I guess combining

180
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:33,495
your first lesson with this
visit wasn't such a good idea.

181
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,827
Oh, don't be ridiculous!
You're an aunt now.

182
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:41,907
That's way more important
than some friendship lesson.

183
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,566
I just wish there
was a way to do both.

184
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,381
Maybe there is.

185
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,375
You've already done the
work for Starlight's lesson

186
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:51,310
with this list.

187
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,126
All we have to do is follow it.

188
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:56,080
Spike, you're a genius!

189
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:59,396
Yeah. Genius.

190
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:00,775
Then it's settled.

191
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:03,249
Shining Armor and I will
head straight to the castle

192
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,575
and you two can head
straight to Sunburst's.

193
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,966
Aye, aye, princess.

194
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,609
All right, big brother.

195
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:15,384
Let's go see this
amazing baby pony.

196
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,172
I know you're a little
worried about this reunion,

197
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,609
but I'm sure Twilight's
got everything covered.

198
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,867
Everything except how I'd rather
do absolutely anything else.

199
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,458
I bet she's taken
that into account too.

200
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:37,784
It's all part of the
lesson. Trust the lesson.

201
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:39,353
Right.

202
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,661
Hey, is that you?

203
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,400
Oh. Yep. It sure is.

204
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:51,649
Now... according to the
list, Sunburst's house is--

205
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,461
Why is there a statue of
you in the Crystal Empire?

206
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,310
Because Spike, the
brave and glorious,

207
00:11:57,347 --> 00:11:59,563
saved all of us
from King Sombra.

208
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,252
And then again during
the Equestria Games.

209
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:03,304
Really?

210
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:05,181
Really! Big fan.

211
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
Um, when were you going
to tell me about this?

212
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:11,421
Oh, it's no big deal.

213
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,686
IT MOST CERTAINLY IS!

214
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:16,073
That's it.

215
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:19,753
We're not going anywhere
until I get the whole story.

216
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,492
Before we go in, I should
probably tell you,

217
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,821
seeing the baby might
be a bit of a shock.

218
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,861
Come on, big brother,
I've met babies before.

219
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:37,704
I expect meeting this one
won't be any different.

220
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,618
Of course, I could be wrong.

221
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,833
iiiiiaaa, ahhh, GNAGRN

222
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,212
The baby is an Alicorn?

223
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,987
It looks that way.

224
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:00,695
But! but!

225
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:03,150
But I thought Alicorn
wings had to be earned

226
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:06,436
by accomplishing some great
princess-worthy deed.

227
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:09,230
Yeah, how can you just
be born with them?

228
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:10,769
The birth of an Alicorn

229
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,224
is something Equestria
has never seen.

230
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:15,815
It is beyond even
our understanding.

231
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:18,190
That's not very reassuring.

232
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,652
Wow, a unicorn and a Pegasus!

233
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:24,738
So, she could be a super strong
flyer and have crazy baby magic.

234
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,080
Well, I know all about
super strong flying.

235
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,480
And I can help keep
tabs on her magic.

236
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:46,018
It appears her magic
is more powerful

237
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:47,809
than that of a newborn unicorn.

238
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,969
The crowds have already
started to gather.

239
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:55,095
This Crystalling is
gonna be some party!

240
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,046
Do you think we
should call it off?

241
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,200
Um, we've all faced a lot
worse than baby magic.

242
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:04,898
I can't imagine cancelling

243
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,867
such a beautiful and
important ceremony

244
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,544
over something so
potentially adorable.

245
00:14:09,624 --> 00:14:12,080
Yeah! Of course! Come on!

246
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,566
In light of the little
one's abilities,

247
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:17,409
this Crystalling might be
more important than ever.

248
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,753
Perhaps you should
address your subjects

249
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,021
and remind them of that.

250
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:32,012
Shining Armor, do you
have everything you need

251
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:32,984
for the ceremony?

252
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:37,913
Huh? Oh! NO! I still have to
interview the Honor Guards,

253
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,609
chose the Purity Crystal
and pick a Crystaller!

254
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,043
All right. Take it easy.

255
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:46,683
Pinkie can stay here with me
and keep an eye on the baby.

256
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:51,747
And we'll all help you
with everything else.

257
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,633
That is if you can stay awake
long enough to tell us how.

258
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:01,907
And that's how we found
the Crystal Heart,

259
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,775
defeated King Sombra
and saved the Empire.

260
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:07,876
Yay! We love you, Spike! Yeah!

261
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:10,572
Tell the one about
the Equestria Games!

262
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:14,381
Well, as much as I love
reliving my heroic deeds,

263
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,713
Starlight and I have an
important lesson to do

264
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:18,898
by order of the
Princess of Friendship.

265
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:20,646
AWWWWW!

266
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:24,430
Oh, come on, Spike. I want to
hear about the Games, too.

267
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,581
I know you're nervous
about seeing Sunburst,

268
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:29,680
but it says right
in step three to,

269
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:33,513
"deal with your fears by facing
them," not by putting it off.

270
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:37,544
Ugh. Let's go get
this over with.

271
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:45,255
Wait!

272
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:46,049
What?

273
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:48,596
Knocking on the door isn't
the next thing on the list.

274
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:49,913
Seriously?

275
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:52,172
I know Twilight can
be a little nitpicky,

276
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:54,043
but this is your first
lesson as her pupil

277
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,055
and it's important
that we do it right.

278
00:15:57,175 --> 00:16:00,036
Fine. What's the next
thing on the list?

279
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,363
"Before they see each other,
make sure to highlight

280
00:16:04,387 --> 00:16:05,827
the importance of the meeting."

281
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:08,430
I'm pretty sure
we can skip that.

282
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,690
I don't know!

283
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:12,153
I mean, if we skip it, the
whole lesson could go south.

284
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,486
And then you might end up
taking a giant step backwards

285
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:15,513
instead of forwards.

286
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,243
Maybe you'll never be
able to learn anything

287
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,510
about friendship at all.

288
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:22,676
It's almost like your whole
future depends on this moment.

289
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,400
"Highlight the importance
of the meeting." Check.

290
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:28,640
I can't believe you
wanted to skip that.

291
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:43,723
Sunburst?

292
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:46,080
Yes? What can I do for you?

293
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:49,630
It's, it's me. Starlight.

294
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:52,061
We used to be friends?

295
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:59,163
Oh, of course! Starlight. My
goodness, it's been a long time.

296
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,993
What, what have
you been up to?

297
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:07,587
Me? Oh, you know, some
of this, some of that.

298
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,080
Different stuff.

299
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,747
Right now I'm sort of,
Twilight Sparkle's new pupil.

300
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:16,006
The Princess of Friendship?

301
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:20,596
Heh. Yeah. That's actually
kind of why I'm here.

302
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:23,833
I mean, I know you're
probably very busy.

303
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:24,867
What do you mean?

304
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:27,636
Well, I figured
after Magic School,

305
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:30,258
you'd go on to do important
wizard work, but...

306
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:35,723
Oh. No. Yes. Oh yes, that's
me. Yep. Important wizard.

307
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:39,513
Really busy with lots of,
uh... wizarding stuff.

308
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,787
Right, well Good to see you.

309
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:48,547
Huh. Maybe we
should have skipped

310
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,929
"highlighting the importance
of the meeting" after all.

311
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,353
Well? I guess that's that!

312
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,335
Starlight, come on!

313
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:57,944
We have to at least explain
what Twilight wants!

314
00:17:58,633 --> 00:17:59,667
Ugh.

315
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:11,723
Dearest Citizens, I am sure
you are all just as thrilled

316
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:15,889
and ready for this Crystalling
as myself and Shining Armor.

317
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,901
I'm not ready!

318
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,187
Take it easy.

319
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:28,418
Just pick whoever looks the
most like Honor Guard material.

320
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,326
Right. Right!

321
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:35,298
I'm sorry;

322
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,732
fatherhood is way more
stressful than I ever thought.

323
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:40,756
I can only imagine.

324
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:43,686
Now, I know choosing
the crystal of purity

325
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:45,433
is a very important decision,

326
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:48,350
so I have gone through the
trouble of arranging them

327
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,018
in order from incredibly
pure to outrageously pure.

328
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:56,080
Um, Rarity? Don't they
all sort of look the same?

329
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,849
Oh well, to the
untrained eye, perhaps.

330
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,390
What do you think,
Shining Armor?

331
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,873
I DON'T KNOW!

332
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:07,944
I hope Twilight and Pinkie

333
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:09,790
are having better
luck with the baby.

334
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,670
Well, at least she's having fun!

335
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,326
Pinkie, hold her still!

336
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:27,403
I'm trying!

337
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:40,110
So, the Princess of
Friendship wants you and I

338
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,501
to be friends again?

339
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,384
I know. Weird, right?

340
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,243
I don't understand.

341
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:50,590
Did something happen to you
after I left for Magic School?

342
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:54,510
What? No! I don't see what
that has to do with anything.

343
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:56,449
Why would you even ask that?

344
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:01,889
I mean, did something
happen to you

345
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:03,723
after you left for magic school?

346
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:10,424
What? Um. No. Like you said,
I'm a important wizard.

347
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,670
I'm sure there's something
on Twilight's list

348
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:15,612
that can help here.

349
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:27,790
OK. I chose the Honor Guard,
picked the Purity Crystal

350
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,756
and I know exactly who I
want to be our Crystaller.

351
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:32,824
So, all we need is...

352
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,353
The baby?

353
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,600
We're here!

354
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:41,353
She's a really strong flyer!

355
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:15,716
I'm guessing that's gonna make
it hard to do the Crystalling.

356
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:17,212
It's worse than that...

357
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:20,646
Without the Heart, the Crystal
Empire is about to be buried

358
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:22,461
under a mountain
of ice and snow!
