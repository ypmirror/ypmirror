1
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:11,965
So, Scootaloo's keeping
Petunia busy like you asked.

2
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,568
What did you two
want to talk about?

3
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:16,775
I'm sure you get these
questions all the time.

4
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:19,154
Oh, this is so awkward.

5
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:23,652
Uh, you're the experts, so we
thought you'd have some insight

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,236
into our daughter's
new...uh, cutie mark.

7
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:27,179
What's wrong?

8
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:32,344
Obviously, we're both very proud
of her and her cutie mark.

9
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:35,867
Despite its, um,
unsettling nature.

10
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,643
Unsettling?

11
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,248
I don't get
what you mean.

12
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:48,386
Her mark doesn't
bother you at all?

13
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:50,306
Hey! Check out what we found!

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,229
Look! A spiny-backed Pon-asaurus
in our own backyard!

15
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:59,714
And I found them on my
very own. How cool is that?

16
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,888
Oooooh. She's an
archaeologist!

17
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:08,340
Of course! What did you think
she was gonna be? A pirate?

18
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:14,184
Pirate! Pfft! Why
would we think that?

Why "Petunia" has our cutie mark?!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

20
00:01:56,212 --> 00:02:00,330
Whoo-hoo! Another successful
cutie intervention.

21
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:03,888
You know Crusaders, I don't
want to toot our own horn...

22
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:06,653
but we've helped a lot of
ponies figure out their

23
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:07,544
purpose in life.

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,005
Like Blue Note, here. Nice
saxophone, Blue Note!

25
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,530
Yep. Everywhere you look,

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,975
there's a pony we've
helped find a purpose.

27
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:26,205
You've gotta admit, we've
had a pretty good effect

28
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:28,928
on everypony since we
discovered our destiny.

29
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:31,846
And started helping other
ponies discover theirs!

30
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,146
Could this get any
better or what?

31
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,102
Now, Scootaloo, you do know
there will always be challenges.

32
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:42,212
Someday, somepony might even
come to us with a problem

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,977
that even we can't
handle. Like, say...

34
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:46,274
...a griffon?

35
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:51,095
Ha! Exactly. Like a griffon.
But that's just crazy talk.

36
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:52,504
OR NOT!

37
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,095
Is that really a griffon?

38
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,834
You're durn tootin' it is!

39
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,699
Whaddya think that
griffon wants?

40
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,179
I guess we've gotta
ask her but...

41
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:08,601
aren't Griffons supposed to
be kind of mean and cranky?

42
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:11,812
Crusaders, looks like we've
gotta step carefully!

43
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:17,471
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

44
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:19,725
I can't believe it's
really really you!

45
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:26,257
This... griffon... not cranky!

46
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,857
How in the blooming apples
did you know who we are?

47
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:32,765
Know who you are?
KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

48
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:35,944
Why, I've heard about you
from everypony in Ponyville!

49
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:38,622
I'm so excited to meet
you, I could just EXPLODE!

50
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,436
I'm Gabriella, but
you can call me Gabby,

51
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,003
since we're friends
now. Pleased to meetcha!

52
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:50,549
Well, howdy, um... Gabby.

53
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,586
OOOOOOH! I'm just
about the most excited

54
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:56,069
any griffon has ever
been about anything.

55
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:58,918
Excited? But whatever for?

56
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,293
What for? WHAT FOR?

57
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,546
Everypony in town tells me
of your amazing assistance.

58
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:07,662
How you help ponies find
their place in the world.

59
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:09,798
It's a calling. But...

60
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:12,441
And that's why I'm
here. I need help, too.

61
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:16,052
I want you to give
me a cutie mark!

62
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:20,201
Um, can a griffon
even GET a Cutie Mark?

63
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,714
I don't know, but I think we
should probably find out.

64
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:29,408
So, Gabriella...

65
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:30,393
Gabby, 'kay?

66
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,843
'Gabby.' Why do you
even want a cutie mark?

67
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:37,766
It doesn't seem like a very
griffon-y thing to want.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,829
Right? Right? RIIIIIGHT?

69
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,921
You're telling me! I don't
know if you've heard,

70
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,041
but griffons can be a
little bit unfriendly.

71
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,648
<i> Most griffons don't pay much</i>
<i> attention to each other.</i>

72
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:51,638
<i> And if they do,</i>
<i> it's not, y'know...</i>

73
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,876
<i> the good kind of attention.</i>

74
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:55,593
<i> As for me, I'm just a little</i>
<i> mail-delivery griffon</i>

75
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:57,846
<i> who likes to spread a little</i>
<i> bit of griffon-y sunshine</i>

76
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,853
<i> on my rounds! Which</i>
<i> always made me feel</i>

77
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:01,440
<i> different from the</i>
<i> other griffons.</i>

78
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:08,640
<i> I'd do anything for any</i>
<i> ol' griffon in need.</i>

79
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:13,008
<i> But it just always seemed</i>
<i> like the harder I tried,</i>

80
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:14,299
<i> the less I fit in!</i>

81
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,713
<i> It wasn't until your friends</i>
<i> came to Griffonstone</i>

82
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:19,050
<i> that I realized some</i>
<i> creatures actually like</i>

83
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,170
<i> helping each other.</i>

84
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:22,344
<i> And I saw something</i>
<i> so awesomely awesome!</i>

85
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,843
<i> How helping spreads from pony</i>
<i>to pony and griffon to griffon.</i>

86
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,006
<i> I knew then that I had find</i>
<i> out why I was so different</i>

87
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,095
<i> from the other griffons.</i>

88
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,280
<i> And I knew the answer just</i>
<i> HAD to have something to do</i>

89
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:36,667
<i> with those wonderful, amazing</i>
<i> marks on the ponies' flanks!</i>

90
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:41,325
<i> And I admit, I became,</i>
<i> maybe, a little obsessed.</i>

91
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,805
<i> So first chance I had to</i>
<i> deliver a letter from Gilda,</i>

92
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,201
<i> I took it so I could</i>
<i> find the perfect ponies</i>

93
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,034
<i> to help me understand</i>
<i> what those marks are.</i>

94
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,866
<i> Everypony here</i>
<i> told me one thing:</i>

95
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:53,711
<i> I just HAD to see the</i>
<i> cutie mark crusaders.</i>

96
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,292
<i> They've helped everypony</i>
<i> here get their cutie marks.</i>

97
00:05:56,448 --> 00:06:00,403
<i> And I knew, I just knew, that</i>
<i> someday I'd have one, too:</i>

98
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:03,053
<i> a cutie mark of my very own!</i>

99
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,780
That's why I flew
all the way here.

100
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,686
I want to find my own
place in the world

101
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:10,911
and I know you can help me
by giving me a cutie mark!

102
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,440
So let's make with
the cutie!

103
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,690
Whenever you're ready!

104
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,600
Did it happen yet?

105
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,354
Uh, not exactly.

106
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:22,789
How 'bout now? How 'bout now?
How 'bout now? How 'bout now?

107
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,813
Um, Gabby, I hate
to break it to you,

108
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:29,353
but it sounds like you
mighta heard some tall tales

109
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:31,238
about what Crusaders can do.

110
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:34,580
I mean, we are kinda
awesome and all,

111
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:37,579
but nopony can just
give you a cutie mark.

112
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:40,420
It just sort of... happens.

113
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,666
Though I'm pretty sure it
doesn't happen to Griffons.

114
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,372
Or if it does, we've
never ever heard of it.

115
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,040
Oh. I hadn't thought of that.

116
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,758
Sounds like a challenge.
And who could be up to it

117
00:06:52,782 --> 00:06:55,151
but the world-famous
Cutie Mark Crusaders?

118
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:57,213
it's in your name
and everything,

119
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,493
right? Right? RIGHT?

120
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,784
Now I have to deliver Gilda's
letter to Rainbow Dash.

121
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:03,220
I bet by the time I get back,

122
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,551
you'll have it one-hundred
percent figured out!

123
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,008
Toodles for now.

124
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:11,099
Wheeeee! Gonna
get my Cutie Mark!

125
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:14,400
What she wants, it's
not possible, right?

126
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:18,403
I don't know. But I know
someone who just might!

127
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:21,819
I've read every
book on the subject.

128
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:24,020
And I've never read a
thing about any creature

129
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:25,933
other than a pony
getting a cutie mark!

130
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,356
But Twilight, Gabby flew all the
way here so we could help her.

131
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,433
There's gotta be
something we can do.

132
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:35,154
Say... is there some kind
of spell you can whip up

133
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:36,570
to make her mark appear?

134
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:39,986
Um, I don't know if any of
you remember, but using magic

135
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:43,092
to get a cutie mark never
really works out all that well.

136
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,935
Ohhhhhh... riiiiight.

137
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:50,292
Crusaders, I'm sorry. While
I can't say for certain

138
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,963
that it's utterly impossible,
the chances of Gabby

139
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,013
getting an actual mark
are... pretty slim.

140
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,031
Everything I've ever
learned tells me...

141
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,791
it's just not gonna happen.

142
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,012
Oh NO! Poor Gabby!

143
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,241
What the apples are we
ever gonna tell her?

144
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,553
Crusaders, this is terrible!

145
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:16,820
Gabby really believed in us, and
now we're going to let her down.

146
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,151
But what else can we do?

147
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:22,459
Hmmm. You know what,
Crusaders? So what.

148
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:24,723
Maybe we can't help
Gabby get a cutie mark,

149
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,827
but we can still do
what we're best at.

150
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:29,415
We can help her
find her purpose!

151
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:32,132
And I reckon doin' that
is the same for Griffons

152
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,704
as it is for ponies... or any
other creature in Equestria!

153
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:39,429
All we have to do is be extra
special clear with her.

154
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,083
Like, Crystal Empire clear.

155
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:43,495
Yeah!

156
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:47,718
INCOMING!

157
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,337
Hiya, you wonderful,
wonderful Crusaders.

158
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:56,330
I just know you figured
out how to help me

159
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:57,930
because you're
all so incredible!

160
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,586
Well, Gabby, we've
talked it over

161
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:04,379
and we think we may just
be able to help you out

162
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:07,499
but not exactly in
the way you think.

163
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,848
See, here's the thing about
you getting a cutie mark.

164
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,229
I'M GETTING A Cutie
mark! Wooo-whooooo!

165
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:17,224
Wait, you didn't let me finish!

166
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,420
WHEEEEE!

167
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:21,746
Um, I think maybe that
could have been clearer.

168
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:26,608
Cutie mark, cutie mark,
gonna get my cutie mark!

169
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,429
YEAH! Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

170
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,888
She's still going! Anypony know
if Griffons ever get tired?

171
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:36,313
What do you think my mark
will be? A lightning bolt?

172
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:39,711
An erupting volcano?! I don't
care if it's a jar of marmalade.

173
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:42,361
I know I'll love
it, whatever it is!

174
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,452
Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby,

175
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:46,229
there's something
we need to clear up.

176
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,775
We can definitely help
you find your purpose

177
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,572
but that mark's probably
not gonna happen.

178
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:53,067
WHAT?!

179
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:56,354
It's true. Twilight's
never heard of a creature

180
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,215
other than a pony
getting a cutie mark.

181
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:02,841
Oh, pfft, is that all? You
had me worried for a second.

182
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:05,728
I mean, there's a first
time for everything, right?

183
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:09,095
And she didn't say it
was impossible, right?

184
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,457
Well, not exactly.

185
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:14,678
Well, then if anypony can make
it happen, it's you three!

186
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,591
I mean, you haven't failed yet!

187
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:19,234
You know what, Gabby?

188
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,480
I promise, we're gonna
do everything we can

189
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:23,662
to help you get your mark!

190
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:30,041
OH! It's gonna happen! I can
feel it! Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo!

191
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,979
Aaaaand, she's off again.

192
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,386
Why in tarnation would
you promise something

193
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:36,041
that just can't be done!

194
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,394
I know what it's like to want
something that's out of reach.

195
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,387
And just because it
hasn't happened yet

196
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:42,740
doesn't mean it can't.

197
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:45,874
Maybe trying for the
impossible isn't so bad.

198
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,050
I guess we'll never know for
sure unless we give it a try.

199
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:51,791
All right. But where
do we even start?

200
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,972
Where we always do, with a good
ol' fashioned Crusaders CHART!

201
00:10:57,627 --> 00:11:00,493
The first thing we gotta
do is find your purpose.

202
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:02,483
No pony gets a mark without one.

203
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:04,880
All right! Let's do this!

204
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,401
What are you good at?
Do you play any sports?

205
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:08,671
Or like to dance?

206
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:13,582
Or how about singing? I just
love to sing. LA LA LA LAAAAAAA!

207
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:16,744
Wow. I kinda wanna
just try everything.

208
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:18,671
I mean, I don't even
know what to pick!

209
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,547
Don't worry, that's

Now how we gonna do THIS?

252
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,360
Gabby's special purpose
can't be everything, right?

253
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:46,925
It may as well be.

254
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,290
I don't know how we find
what she's supposed to do

255
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:51,196
when she can do it all.

256
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,904
And if finding her
purpose seems impossible,

257
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,822
we can just forget about
the whole Griffon-getting

258
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,060
-a-cutie-mark thing which
is actually impossible.

259
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:04,073
I never should have
gotten her hopes up.

260
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,836
I Did. It. All! So? Lay
it on me, Crusaders.

261
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,387
What's my purpose?

262
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,372
And how do we get a mark
on these here haunches?

263
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:18,226
Gabby, we ... we don't.

264
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,841
Wait! What are you saying?

265
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,516
We're saying that since
you can do everything

266
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,262
so amazingly well...

267
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:28,747
we just can't figure out what
one thing you're supposed to do.

268
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:32,726
Gabby. We can't help you.

269
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:36,149
But-but you're the world-famous
Cutie Mark Crusaders!

270
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:40,142
I can't believe it. I
- I WON'T believe it.

271
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,000
Gabby! Wait!

272
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:45,655
We're sorry! We're so, so sorry!

273
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,947
This is just awful!

274
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,325
For the first time ever,
the Cutie Mark Crusaders

275
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,972
are cutie mark... failures!

276
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:02,653
I'm sorry, Crusaders. I really
thought we could help Gabby.

277
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:05,102
I thought we could help anypony.

278
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:08,977
Maybe that's just it. Maybe
we can only help ponies.

279
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:11,478
Or maybe we just plain failed.

280
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,640
Failed? Then what
do you call THIS?

281
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:17,645
A CUTIE MARK!?

282
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,206
WHAT? You got your
mark after all!

283
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,120
Even though we couldn't
find your purpose?

284
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,034
But - whaaaa? Huh? HOW?

285
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:28,730
An' what does it
mean? A cauldron?

286
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:33,227
Um, I don't know. Maybe
it means my purpose is uh,

287
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:34,900
helping uh, Zecora with potions.

288
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:36,591
That's the first thing I tried.

289
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:40,191
I guess it just took some time
to appear but here it is!

290
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:44,003
This. Is. AWESOME!
We're not failures.

291
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,561
Whatever we did WORKED!

292
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,389
I had a feeling we could
help you and we did!

293
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:51,262
Ooh, we've gotta go see
Twilight right away!

294
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:52,772
She'll want to know about this.

295
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,954
Correction: she NEEDS
to know about this.

296
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,551
I bet she'll want to
write a whole book

297
00:15:57,593 --> 00:16:00,379
about the very first Griffon to
get a cutie mark of her own!

298
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,697
Oh, totally. Um, but you
know Rainbow Dash asked me

299
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,210
to pick up her answer
to Gilda's letter.

300
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:09,673
I better take care of
that before I forget.

301
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,553
Here's an idea: uh,
you head to the castle,

302
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:17,888
I'll meet you there, cutie
mark and all. Um.... toodles!

303
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,125
Wow, can you believe it?

304
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,375
We were able to help her
get her mark after all!

305
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,102
Come on, Crusaders;
let's tell Twilight!

306
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:30,107
Gabby? You just missed her!
She was in such a hurry

307
00:16:30,118 --> 00:16:31,175
she didn't even come in.

308
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:33,360
Just dropped this
letter and zoomed away.

309
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:37,474
Dear Crusaders: I'll
never forget you!

310
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,688
You really are every bit
as awesome as I heard.

311
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:43,853
I'm heading home to
tell all the griffons

312
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:45,349
how you did the impossible

313
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:48,747
by getting me my
cutie mark. Toodles!

314
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,939
Wait a second, CUTIE MARK?

315
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,784
You actually got a
griffon a cutie mark

316
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,603
for the first time
in recorded history?

317
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,707
You know what this calls for?
A full-scale research project!

318
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:03,335
This makes no sense.

319
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,328
Gabby didn't come in
and show you her mark?

320
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:08,000
You have GOT to get Gabby
back here right away.

321
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,843
I have so many
questions!

322
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,954
I hope I have
enough ink and parchment

323
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,133
to document EVERYTHING!

324
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:15,836
SPIKE! Guess what just happened!

325
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,848
Weird. Gabby didn't
show Twilight her mark,

326
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,469
like she said she
was gonna do?

327
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,680
Something in this here
applesauce smells kinda fishy.

328
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,135
We better find her and
find out what's going on!

329
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,408
Come on, Crusaders.

330
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,542
Keep your eyes on
the skies, ponies.

331
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:32,083
Gabby can't have gone far.

332
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:34,462
She's not in the air,
she's right THERE!

333
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:37,429
Gabby! Hold up, we're a-comin'!

334
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:40,994
Um, sorry, no time to chat.
I just stopped to help

335
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,575
this pony get out of the muck
and then I really gotta fly!

336
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:46,361
OK, HEAVE-HOHHHH!

337
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:50,838
Gabby, we're your friends!

338
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,568
Why in Equestria you
running away from us?

339
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,660
Running away? Oh,
I'm not running away.

340
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:00,970
I'm just, um, excited to
show my lovely new cutie mark

341
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,137
to everyone in Griffonstone.

342
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:06,278
You mean the cutie mark that's
runnin' right off your flank?

343
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,817
Yup. That's the one.

344
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,495
I guess the one thing I'm
really not that good at...

345
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,321
is faking things.

346
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,629
Wow, Gabby, painting
on a fake cutie mark

347
00:18:16,657 --> 00:18:20,233
to make yourself feel better?
You must have been REALLY upset.

348
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,629
Sure, I was disappointed

349
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:25,801
but I didn't do it to
make myself feel better.

350
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:28,438
I wanted to make
you feel better!

351
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:32,452
I couldn't bear you three
thinking you failed

352
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,636
after you tried so
hard to help.

353
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:37,860
That's why I had to leave before
you or Twilight found out

354
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:42,059
the truth. I'm sorry
I wasn't honest with you.

355
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,873
I'll just wing my way
back to Griffonstone.

356
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:46,594
Thanks for trying.

357
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,415
You don't need to
apologize for caring about

358
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:50,994
how other ponies are feelin'!

359
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:53,474
I'm just sorry we couldn't
come through for you.

360
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:57,043
Hmmm... maybe we can.

361
00:18:57,276 --> 00:19:00,212
Gabby, clean up and meet us
at the Crusaders clubhouse!

362
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:06,493
I know you all tried
your very best,

363
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:09,954
but I guess griffons and
cutie marks just don't mix.

364
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,426
Maybe I don't even
have a special purpose.

365
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:16,633
Hang on a second! We
were wracking our brains

366
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,575
trying to figure out your
destiny until we remembered

367
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:21,826
how every time you
did something new,

368
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,542
you tried to help
everypony around you.

369
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:26,848
Even us! How did it feel

370
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:28,633
when you showed up
with that fake mark

371
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,852
and the three of us thought
we'd actually helped you?

372
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,332
Well...I was really glad
I helped you feel happier!

373
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:38,396
So maybe helping is
your thing.

374
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:41,276
You might even say
it's your purpose.

375
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:45,787
But helping just feels good.It
couldn't have anything to do

376
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,723
with what I'm supposed to
do with my life, right?

377
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:52,212
Gabby, finding your special
purpose doesn't have to be

378
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:53,791
about being good at something,

379
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,356
it's about feeling good
about something inside.

380
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,036
And it looks like your destiny
is a whole lot like ours:

381
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:02,441
helping others.

382
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:05,325
And you don't need a symbol
on your flank to know that!

383
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,539
But since we ARE the
Cutie Mark Crusaders,

384
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:11,666
we made you one
anyway! Behold!

385
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,019
Your very own cutie mark!

386
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:16,657
TA DA!

387
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,453
We carved it to mark the
moment we all figured out

388
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:20,744
what you should
do with your life!

389
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:25,853
But they look just like
yours? You can't mean...

390
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:31,366
You bet we do! You're one of us
now! Gabby, today we dub thee...

391
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:35,513
the very first Griffon member
of the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

392
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:37,506
WOOHOO!

393
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:40,779
You may not be able
to get a cutie mark...

394
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:42,866
...but you're selflessly
dedicatin' your life

395
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,337
to helpin' others anyhow!

396
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:47,513
I can't think of anything
more Crusadery than that!

397
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,332
AWESOME! My very own cutecinera!

398
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:56,949
Landsakes, you sure
have earned it!

399
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,549
And so have we. Scootaloo,
you're pretty amazing.

400
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:02,222
Even though things
looked bleak,

401
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:04,504
you still found a way to
help Gabby in the end.

402
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:06,813
'Course! Helping's
what we do, right?

403
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:11,457
Ooooo, I am SOOOOO grateful!

404
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:14,118
I'm gonna go home and
do my very very best

405
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:17,363
to bring Cutie Mark Crusader
values to Griffonstone,

406
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:19,092
I promise!

407
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:21,387
Promise us one other thing, too?

408
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:23,721
COME BACK SOON!

409
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:27,846
After all, you're a Crusader
now. Crusaders forever?

410
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:30,313
Crusaders forever!
