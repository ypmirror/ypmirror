351
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,830
I mean, the curtain came
up, and there you were,

352
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,760
singing in front of everypony!

353
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,830
And, you know, I don't think
any pony was jealous

354
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,200
cause there certainly
wasn't an angry mob!

355
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,650
But it must have been horrible
standing there on stage!

356
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,390
All eyes glued directly on you.

357
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,640
It's like you were living your
own personal worst nightmare!

358
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,810
<i>(sobbing)</i>

359
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,840
It was!

360
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,670
(frantic sobbing)

361
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,320
What? Too much?

362
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,210
<i>(crying)</i>

363
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,070
What Pinkie meant to say was
that you were really great.

364
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,370
Wait! Didn't I say that?

365
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,620
Hardly!

366
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,460
Whoops!

367
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,510
YOU WERE GREAT!

368
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,480
You totally blew
my mind!

369
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,790
Incredible!

370
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,100
Though, no offence, you
kind of sounded like a dude.

371
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,390
<i>(sobs)</i>

372
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,830
A great sounding dude!

373
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,910
Well, thank you all.

374
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,650
I'm glad you enjoyed it...

375
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,660
...because I'm never going to
sing in front of anypony

376
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,850
ever again.

377
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,950
<i>(gasp)</i>

378
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,690
Oh no!

379
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,830
Are you kidding me?

380
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,290
Can we please
stop running!

381
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,770
<i>(panting)</i>

382
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,790
I just don't understand
why, Fluttershy.

383
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,610
<i>After all, you're the one</i>
<i>that wanted the Pony Tones</i>

384
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,690
to sing for every silly
thing that was requested of us.

385
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,940
You mean, you knew I
really wanted to perform?

386
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,850
Of course I knew!

387
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,270
Oh.

388
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,010
And for all her babbling, Pinkie
Pie was right about one thing.

389
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,490
Only one?

390
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,770
When that curtain fell, and
everypony saw you singing,

391
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,420
you lived your worst nightmare.

392
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,110
Was it really that bad?

393
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,730
Yes!

394
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,880
Well, what was so bad about it?

395
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,690
The thunderous
applause?

396
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,840
The praise for your
fantastic singin'?

397
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,800
