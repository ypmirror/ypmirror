Phew!

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,640
Look at that, Pound Cake.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,300
I am so close to breaking my
personal cupcake icing record!

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,490
My goodness! I can't believe
what I'm seeing here!

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,740
Pretty impressive,
if I do say so myself.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,420
Pinkie, would you mind
watching the counter

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,700
while I pop to the supply room?

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,360
We've just received
a very special order

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,660
and the ingredients
need to be perfect.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,680
Okie-dokie-lokie.

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,400
Thanks, dear!

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,300

Cadance are having A BABY?

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,840
This is the best news ever! I
can't wait to tell Twilight!

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh, and Pinkie? Uh, it's
a Top Secret surprise!

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,460
Shhhhhhhh!

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
A Top Secret Surprise?

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,140
But that means I have to keep
the exciting news... [gulps]

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,640
... to myself!

I can't tell Twilight

28
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,660

29

Right, Gummy?

30
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,190
Did you take that
from Pound Cake again?

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't you know it's wrong
to steal from a baby?

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,500
What's all this
about a baby?

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
What? Who? What? Who said
something about a baby?

34
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,400
You did, Miss Pie. Just now.
What were you talking about?

Somepony special is

40
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,740

[Both at once] Shining
Armor and Princess Cadance!

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,420
Yes, and they're coming--

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,840
Tomorrow!

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,140
Yes, on the--

47
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,020
Friendship Express rather
than the Crystal Empire train

48
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,160
so as not to cause
too much of a scene

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,240
when they skip
town to come visit?

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Yes.

51
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,520
Aaaaaand?

52
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,660
And that's it.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,130
Oh.

54
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,740
Uh, how did you
know all that?

55
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,060
Hehe, heh, uh... Pinkie sense?

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,380
So, you said you needed
our help with something?

57
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,260
Follow me.

58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,540
Sweet posters! Is
that Smash Fortune?

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,880
It sure is.

60
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,180
When Shining Armor said he
wanted to come to the castle

61
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,180
and visit, I started
collecting things he liked

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,800
when he was a colt
as a surprise.

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,840
Surprise?

64
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,640
[nervous giggle]

65
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,360
I've been so excited that it's
been hard to keep it to myself.

66
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,680
I have no idea what that's like.

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,620
Aww, look at the
cute little ant farm.

68
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,080
[screams]

69
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,380

these old comic books!

70
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,360

mint in bag.

71

What's this?

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,220
This is Brutus Force!

75
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,630
Shining Armor used to carry
him around like his baby.

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,940
Yeah, ha ha, really
cute, [forced laughter]

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,700
It is a bit juvenile
for castle decor,

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,460
but it is very sweet of you.

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm sure Shining
Armor will love it.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,180
Me too. But, there's a few
more things I'd like to add

81
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,960
before he gets here

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,920
and I could really use
a hoof collecting them.

83
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,320
Whatever you need, sugar
cube, we'll help Yeah get it.

84
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,220
[agreement]

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,420
Thanks, everypony.

86
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,120
I just can't wait till they
walk in and see everything!

87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,800
Totally understandable. Watching
somepony else be surprised

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,180
with something is almost
better than being the one

89
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,580
who's getting the surprise!

90
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,120
But what if the surprise is
something so incredibly exciting

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
that a pony can't
keep it in any longer

92
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,680
and she has to tell the pony
who's standing next to her

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,480
what it is or she might explode?

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,500
I would say... no.

95
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,880
The pony who ruins a
surprise for somepony else

96
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,160
has to live with that
guilt... FOREVER!

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,260
[nervous laugh] Gotta bounce!

98
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,440
[pinball bumper bells clanging]

99
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,900
So, I know the bar
is set pretty high...

100
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,280
but does anypony
else think Pinkie Pie

101
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,120
was acting weirder than usual?

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,140
[zoom]

103
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,660
[panting] Phew! That
was close! Too close.

104
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,020
I almost spilled the beans.

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,420
Beans that would be
really hard to clean up.

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,220
I obviously can't be around
my friends right now...

107
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,100
or anypony for that matter.

108
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,380
Hmm. That's it! If
Shining Armor and Cadance

109
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,760
are coming tomorrow, then all
I have to do is lock myself

110
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,960
in my room away from
everypony until they arrive.

111
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,820
Then I won't ruin anything!

112

these deliveries can't wait.

114
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,920
I can't thank you enough

115
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,680
for agreeing to be my backup
delivery pony, Pinkie!

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,560
I did?

117
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,580
Maybe I should hire somepony
to be my backup delivery pony.

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,640
Pinkie: I'll do it!

119
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,340
Really?

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,680
Sure! There's no possible way
that I could ever have anything

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,220
that might interfere
with doing that task-

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,920
like a gigantic,
emotionally-exhausting surprise

123
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,320
that would make it super hard
to be around other ponies.

124
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,700
Great! You're sure you
won't change your mind?

125
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,140
No way. Cross my heart, hope to
fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!

Oh, yeah. I
Pinkie-promised I'd do it.

Hee hee hee.

All the places we sent you
today had something in common.

353
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,360
First we went to
the schoolhouse...

354
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
...and then we read
the Foal Free Press.

355
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,860
After that we found Applejack's
birth certificate...

356
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,500
...and then the last
clue was under a crib...

357
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,940
Hmm. School, foal, birth
certificate, and crib...

A baby, Twilight!
It's a baby! Woo hoo!

361
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,020
You mean... I'm
going to be an aunt?

meet your little foal!

367
