1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,169
Now, what have we learned?

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,444
Lots of control...

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:09,018
Good.

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,747
Screaming and hollering...

5
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:12,836
Yes. And most importantly...

6
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:13,770
Passion!

7
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:14,639
Right!

8
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:18,711
So now that you know the elements
of a good cheer, let's hear one!

9
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:20,774
Yay.

10
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:24,021
You're gonna cheer for me like that?

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,917
-Louder.
-Yay.

12
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,353
-Louder!
-Yay.

13
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:29,063
LOUDER!!!

14
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,651
Yaaay.

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,231
Too loud?

16
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:16,412
Yay.

17
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,812
And now, phase one of my routine...

18
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:30,395
Woo...

19
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:33,099
Phase two...

20
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:48,337
Way to go.

21
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,753
Here we go. Phase three...

22
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:52,822
The sonic rainboom!

23
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,877
Come on!

24
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:09,443
Uh-oh.

25
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:14,765
Last one.

26
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,169
Thank you so much for helping me
clean up all these books, guys.

27
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,079
It was a crazy weekend of studying.

28
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,913
Rainbow Dash, you rock.

29
00:02:29,914 --> 00:02:31,067
Woohoo.

30
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:33,406
Did my cheering do that?

31
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,005
Sorry about that, ladies.

32
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:39,867
That was a truly feeble performance.

33
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:44,602
Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly
liked it when you made the clouds spin.

34
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:48,950
I'm not talking about my performance.
I'm talking about yours.

35
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,725
That feeble cheering.

36
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:52,245
What are you two arguing about?

37
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:54,768
Were we arguing? I'm sorry.

38
00:02:55,522 --> 00:03:00,081
I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see
me competing in the Best Young Flyer Competition.

39
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,164
What's that?

40
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,417
It's where all the greatest
pegasus flyers get together...

41
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:05,457
...and show off their different flying styles!

42
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,610
Some are fast!

43
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:11,781
And some are graceful.

44
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:19,558
Golly! I'd love to see you strut
your stuff in that competition.

45
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,809
Yeah. I wish you guys could be there.

46
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:26,014
Fluttershy is a great support,
but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.

47
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:28,875
Ooh! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom!

48
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,705
It's, like, the most coolest thing ever!

49
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:34,593
Even though I've never actually seen it,
but, I mean, come on, it's a sonic rainboom!

50
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,016
How not cool could it possibly not be?

51
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,083
What's a "sonic rainboom"?

52
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,017
You really need to get out more.

53
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:43,597
The sonic rainboom is legendary!

54
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,563
When a pegasus like Rainbow Dash
gets going so fast...

55
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:47,595
Boom!

56
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:50,687
...a sonic boom and a rainbow
can happen all at once!

57
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:54,293
And Rainbow Dash here's
the only pony to ever pull it off.

58
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:57,543
It was a long time ago. I was just a filly.

59
00:03:57,544 --> 00:03:59,854
Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?

60
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:02,882
A-are you kidding?

61
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:05,981
I'm the greatest flyer
to ever come out of Cloudsdale.

62
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:08,926
I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.

63
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:12,838
Wow. If you pull that off,
you'll win the crown for sure.

64
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:16,160
The grand prize is an entire
day with the Wonderbolts.

65
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:19,551
A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes.

66
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,667
It'll be a dream come true!

67
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:22,896
Yay.

68
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:25,633
I'm gonna go rest up.

69
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:27,851
Don't wanna overprepare myself, you know.

70
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:32,335
You, on the other hand, better keep practicing.

71
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:36,421
I need a cheering section to match
my spectacular performance.

72
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:42,650
She's practiced that move a hundred times
and she's never even come close to doing it.

73
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:45,551
I don't know if I can
cheer loud enough to help her.

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,507
Well, guess we better get this cleaned up.

75
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,718
Again.

76
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:54,034
Go on, go on.

77
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,066
Go on what?

78
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:58,711
Find a spell that will get us
wingless ponies into Cloudsdale.

79
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:00,982
Didn't you see how nervous she was?

80
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:03,275
Nervous?! Have you spit your bit or someth'n?

81
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:06,618
She was tootin' her own horn louder
than the brass section of a marchin' band.

82
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,081
Oh, please.

83
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:12,301
I've put on enough fashion shows
to recognize stage fright when I see it.

84
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,432
You've got to find a way to be there for her.

85
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:15,868
Now go on!

86
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,606
How am I supposed to find
a flight spell in this mess?

87
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:22,346
A flight spell? One sec.

88
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,163
Page 27.

89
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:26,706
How'd you do that?

90
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:29,340
It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash
knocked me into the bookcase.

91
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:30,399
Here it is!

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,333
A spell that will allow earth ponies
to fly for three days.

93
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:37,974
Ooh... It looks really difficult.

94
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:39,741
I'm not sure I can do it.

95
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:41,191
You've got to try.

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,897
Okay. But who's gonna volunteer
to be the test subject?

97
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:49,209
I will!

98
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,728
For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.

99
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,258
Here goes...

100
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,284
I think it worked.

101
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:21,373
You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy.

102
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:23,635
Don't be afraid to speak up.

103
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:33,463
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

104
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:36,526
It's our old friend, Rainbow Crash!

105
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,856
Get kicked out of any flight schools lately?

106
00:06:40,188 --> 00:06:41,920
I didn't get kicked out.

107
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:48,385
Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had
too many rules and not enough naptimes for you.

108
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:51,810
Huh. Ask her about the sonic rainboom!

109
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,235
That's nothing but an old mares' tale.

110
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:57,138
You don't have the skills
to try something like that.

111
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,984
Now wait just a minute!

112
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,740
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive.

113
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:05,930
Anyhow, she *is* going to do a sonic rainboom.

114
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,632
No, she's not, cause there's no such thing.

115
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:11,401
The show up at the Cloudiseum
and see for yourself.

116
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:12,916
...if you're free.

117
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:15,184
Yeah, I'll be free.

118
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,436
Oh, don't worry. We'll be there.

119
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,065
See you then, Rainbow Crash!

120
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:23,099
Did you see that? I was so assertive.

121
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,783
Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.

122
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:29,071
But Rainbow Dash...

123
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:33,690
...just because you failed the sonic rainboom
a hundred thousand times in practice...

124
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:37,238
...doesn't mean you won't be able
to do it in front of an entire stadium...

125
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:41,176
...full of impatient,
super-critical sports fan ponies.

126
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:45,395
What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail!

127
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:47,903
The Wonderbolts will never
let a loser like me join.

128
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:50,992
Princess Celestia will probably
banish me to the Everfree Forest!

129
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:53,944
MY LIFE IS RUINED!!!

130
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:55,314
Rar...

131
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:58,928
Rare? The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!

132
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,662
Rarity?

133
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:05,493
Rarity! Are you...

134
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:06,704
...flying?

135
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:09,468
I most certainly am!

136
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:11,204
Aren't my wings smashing?

137
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:14,860
Twilight made them for me. I just adore them!

138
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:17,576
Why so shocked?

139
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:21,332
We couldn't leave our favorite flyer
without a big cheering section.

140
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:22,241
"We"?

141
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,582
I... I can't believe it!

142
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:33,634
It's incredible.

143
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:36,104
This is so cool! You guys made it!

144
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:37,244
Sure did!

145
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:38,405
WAIT!

146
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:45,998
How'd you do that? Only
pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.

147
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,559
Pretty cool, huh?

148
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:50,099
I found a spell that makes temporary wings...

149
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,477
...but it was too difficult to do more than once.

150
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:56,085
So I found an easier spell that
lets the rest of us walk on clouds.

151
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:58,276
And we came to cheer you to victory.

152
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:04,198
To be honest, I *was* starting to get
just a teeniest, tiniest bit nervous.

153
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,834
But I feel a lot better now
that you guys are here.

154
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,636
Hey! We've got some time before the competition.

155
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:11,951
Why don't Fluttershy and I
show you around Cloudsdale?

156
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:19,516
Here it is. The greatest city in the sky!

157
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:34,592
Some of the greatest pegasi
in history came from Cloudsdale.

158
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:36,297
Oh! Wait for me!

159
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:41,911
Those wings are gorgeous!

160
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,648
Oh, why thank you.

161
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:46,978
Be careful with those wings, Rarity.

162
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,868
They're made from gossamer and morning dew.

163
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:50,933
And they're incredibly delicate.

164
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:56,122
Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get
worn out from too much attention.

165
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:59,727
Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get
a look at where the weather's made.

166
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:04,121
Great idea! Come on, girls!
To the weather factory!

167
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,439
This is where they make the snowflakes.

168
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,269
Each one is hoofmade, as you could see.

169
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,277
It's a delicate operation.

170
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,972
Ooh! The snowflakes look even better from up here.

171
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:33,567
We better move on before Rarity
ruins winter and causes a drought.

172
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,160
And here's where they make the rainbows.

173
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,697
Spicy...!

174
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:53,273
Yeah. Rainbows aren't really
known for their flavor.

175
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:58,361
Where'd you get those
amazing wings? I want a pair.

176
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,445
Yeah, I guess I could see that.

177
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:04,979
Oh hey, look! It's Rainbow Crash again.

178
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,159
Yeah! Rainbow...

179
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:10,635
...Crash!

180
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,436
Rarity! What are you doing
talking to *these* guys?

181
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:17,368
Oh, they were just admiring
my wings, Rainbow Dash.

182
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:22,604
Yeah. You should forget the sonic rainboom
and just get yourself some wings like these.

183
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:27,560
Oh. Come on, girls.

184
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,958
Why don't we go see how clouds are made?

185
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:34,186
Don't listen to them. You're gonna
win that competition for sure.

186
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,917
Are you kidding? I can't do the sonic rainboom.

187
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:41,742
And just look at these boring
plain old feathered wings.

188
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,054
I'm doomed.

189
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:58,914
Why, these old things?

190
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:02,505
Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged.

191
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,838
Rarity! We're supposed to be helping
Rainbow Dash relax, remember?

192
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,277
Put your wings away and stop showing off.

193
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:14,783
Oh. How can you ask me to put away perfection?

194
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,390
Rainbow Dash, are you okay?

195
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,897
You don't look so good.

196
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:28,485
Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay?

197
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:31,281
Everyone's so in love of Rarity's wings
that they won't even notice...

198
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:34,628
...when I totally BLOW IT
in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.

199
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,628
Hey! There's an idea!

200
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:38,439
*You* should enter the competition.

201
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,203
Yeah. I could watch you fly all day long.

202
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:46,342
There really isn't anypony
who uses their wings quite like me.

203
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:48,392
Perhaps I should compete.

204
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:49,550
What?!

205
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,502
What am I gonna do?!

206
00:12:58,503 --> 00:13:01,075
I'll never win the competition now.

207
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,321
I'm going to be a while.

208
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:33,864
Fillies and gentlecolts!
Please rise and join me...

209
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:37,955
...in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!

210
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:48,256
Please welcome our celebrity judges
for the Best Young Flyer Competition...

211
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:51,520
...the Wonderbolts!

212
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:06,907
And now let's find out who will take the prize...

213
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:10,344
...as this year's Best Young Flyer.

214
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:13,351
Okay, contestant number one. You're up.

215
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:19,616
Okay, number two. Let's go.

216
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:20,523
Um...

217
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,578
Come on, come on. We ain't got all day.

218
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,251
She's talking to you.

219
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:28,763
Oh! Uh...

220
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:30,384
Oh, I guess that's me.

221
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,846
Okay, number four. Time to go.

222
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,715
I'm number four and I need
just one more itsy bitsy minute.

223
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,067
Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hm?

224
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:48,905
Look. I don't care who it is,
but somepony's gotta go on.

225
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:50,521
LET'S DO THIS!

226
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:53,381
What am I gonna do?!

227
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:02,176
I loved number seven. Doing fifteen
barrel rolls in a row can't be easy.

228
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:05,824
My favorite is number ten.
She just looks like such a nice pony.

229
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:09,010
Hm. Wonder how come we haven't
seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet.

230
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:10,515
The competition's almost over.

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,008
Number fifteen, let's go.

232
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,590
Rarity...

233
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:22,106
...is ready!

234
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:26,232
Look, ladies, I don't know what to tell you.
There's only time for one more performance.

235
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:29,068
If you both wanna compete, you'll
just have to go out there together.

236
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,402
Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?

237
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:36,458
And now, for our final competitor of the day...

238
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:39,124
...contestant number fifteen!

239
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,507
Uh... and apparently contestant number four.

240
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:47,276
Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best.

241
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:50,465
I hope you don't mind, but I took
the liberty of changing our music.

242
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:54,061
That rock and roll doesn't really match my wings.

243
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,301
Come on, Rainbow Dash. You can do this.

244
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:05,976
Just remember the routine.

245
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:07,665
Phase one...

246
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,874
Nice work, Rainbow Crash!

247
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:35,962
Time for phase two.

248
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:45,523
Look. Phase two is working.

249
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:02,806
And now, for my grand finale, I
will fly right up to the sun...

250
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:06,843
...and beam my beautiful wings
over the whole city of Cloudsdale.

251
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:09,427
Oh, they'll be talking about it for years!

252
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:14,080
Looks like this is my last chance
to turn things around.

253
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:16,866
Phase three: the sonic...

254
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,427
...rainboom.

255
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,249
Wings, don't fail me now.

256
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:34,727
Look upon me, Equestria!

257
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:38,107
For I am Rarity!

258
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,962
Uh-oh.

259
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:52,473
Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!

260
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:07,820
Hold on, Rarity!

261
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,439
I'm coming!

262
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,204
I can't look.

263
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:37,640
A SONIC RAINBOOM!!!
SHE DID IT! SHE DID IT! WAAAH!

264
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:47,652
Whoa...

265
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:01,949
A SONIC RAINBOOM!!!

266
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,350
YEAH!!! YES!!!

267
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:06,942
I did it. I did it!

268
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:09,193
You sure did.

269
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:12,805
Oh, thank you, Rainbow Dash. You saved my life.

270
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:14,835
Oh yeah. I did that too.

271
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:17,450
Best day ever!

272
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:26,643
I want to apologize to all of you
for getting so carried away with my...

273
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:28,347
...beautiful wings.

274
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:30,076
I guess I just lost my head.

275
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:32,456
-It's okay.
-Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo.
-We still love you.

276
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:35,130
And then especially sorry
that I was so thoughtless...

277
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:39,225
...as to jump into the contest at the last minute
after you would work so hard to win it.

278
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:41,707
Can you ever ever forgive me?

279
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:44,872
Oh, it's okay. Everything
turned our all right, right?

280
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:47,893
I just wish I could have met
the Wonderbolts when they were awake.

281
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:52,881
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh...!

282
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:55,513
So you're the little pony who saved our lives?

283
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:58,175
We really wanted to meet you and say thanks.

284
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:00,281
...ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh...

285
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:02,494
Princess!

286
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,103
Hello, Twilight Sparkle. And hello to your friends too.

287
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:12,236
Princess Celestia. I am sorry I ruined the competition.

288
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:15,829
Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.

289
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:17,819
I know she is, my dear.

290
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:23,250
That's why, for her incredible act of bravery
and a spectacular sonic rainboom...

291
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:27,748
...I'm presenting the grand prize
for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner...

292
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,963
...Miss Rainbow Dash!

293
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,244
...ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmy
goshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!

294
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,575
So, Twilight Sparkle. Did you learn anything
about friendship from this experience?

295
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:43,801
I did, Princess. But I think Rarity
learned even more than me.

296
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,394
I certainly did.

297
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,856
I learned how important it is to
keep your hooves on the ground...

298
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,867
...and be there for your friends.

299
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:53,550
Excellent. Well done, Rarity.

300
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,770
This really is the best day ever!

301
00:20:57,771 --> 00:21:00,337
-Uh... Hey, Rainbow Crash...
-Dash!

302
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:02,726
Oh! Uh... Sorry. Rainbow Dash.

303
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:05,998
Uh, we just wanted to congratulate you
on winning the competition.

304
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,740
That sonic rainboom was awesome!

305
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:10,414
Thanks, guys.

306
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:13,801
Uh, we're really sorry we gave you
such a hard time before.

307
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:16,288
Aw, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

308
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,390
Hey, do you wanna hang out with us?

309
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:21,028
Maybe you could show us
how you did that incredible trick?

310
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,548
Sorry, boys...

311
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:26,046
...but I've got plans.

312
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:33,313
