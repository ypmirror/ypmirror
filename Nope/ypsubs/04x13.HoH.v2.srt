they're obsessed

181
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,900

182
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,910
I mean, what could Applejack
possibly have that I don't?

183
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,960
Hmmm.

184
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,880
You know, I have such
respect for the work ethic

185
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,000
of Earth Ponies.

186
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,540
Uh, gee, thanks.

187
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,470
Granny Smith always said,
"Pick an apple a day

188
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,610
and keep trouble away."

189
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,480
How many varieties of
apples do you think there are?

190
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,730
On the farm or in all
of Equestria because--

191
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,760
I once had
an apple so rare,

192
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,080
they thought it
was extinct.

193
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,200
I ate four of them.

194
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,270

195
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,060

196
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,390
That's my thing.

197
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,770
I take the mundane,
the simple, the...

198
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,190
unappreciated, and
I make it relatable.

199
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,850
Well, I hope you can
relate to Ponyville.

200
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,070

201
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,390

mean to Applejack?

204

Look, I'm glad you're
interested in Ponyville and all,

205
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,660
but I'm kinda busy
with my chores

206

Ponyville Days Festival

353
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,920
by looking just like me, because
I'm a trend-setting Fashionista!

354
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,880
You're a trend-setting
Fashionista?

355
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,090
Why that's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever--

356
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,390
I mean, good for you.

357
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,320
I, on the other hoof, couldn't
care less how I look

358
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,020
long as I get the chores done.

359
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,800
Oh? Is that so?

360
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,020
Yes indeedy doodle.

361
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,950
Not me.

362
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,090
My mane needs to be perfectly
coiffed at all times.

363
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,400
Well, my mane is full
of dust and split ends.

364
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,240
My hooves are so polished you
can see your reflection in them.

365
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,130
My hooves are cracked and dry
from working in the fields!

366
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,560
I'm so fashion forward.

367
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,030
I wear droopy drawers.

368
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,380
I smell like rosebuds.

369
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,370
I LOVE BEING COVERED IN MUD!

Goodness! Your couture!

373
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,550
Oh, it's bad.

374
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,990
Will somepony
bring me a towel

375
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,330
to wipe this repulsive
filth from my hooves!

376
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,500
There's the Rarity I know!

377
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,720
Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry
I said all those things.

378
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,040
You're a true friend who
probably knows me better

379
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,000
than I know myself.

380
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,070
I don't know what I was thinking
wearing this ridiculous outfit.

381
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,730
I kinda know how you feel.

382
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,040
But you were just trying to help
me see how silly I was being.

383
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,010
And you were right.

384
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,070
<i>(sigh)</i>

385
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,470
Besides, that gown
looks just gorgeous on you.

386
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,850
I wish I hadn't ruined it.

387
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,780
Thanks. It's
nice ain't it?

388
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,350
It's magnificent!

389
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,840
Wherever did
you get it?

390
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,890
Oh. It's uh... one of yours.

391
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,370
I'll need 3 gallons of boiling
water and one ounce of detergent

392
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,040
START!

393
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,320

394
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,250
I'm moving to Ponyville!

395
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,930
Being the most interesting Pony
in Equestria is exhausting.

396
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,890
I want to leave my exotic,
exciting life behind

397
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,140
and live on a farm.

398
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,220
Both: What?

399
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,010
Well, that's real nice, but I
sure hope you weren't thinking

400
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,160
of Sweet Apple Acres.

401
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,710
Oh.

402
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,540
Look, you're a fine
pony, but uh, well, I'm...

403
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,020
I think what Applejack
is trying to say,

404
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,510
is that there's something
unappealing about a pony

405
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,550
who'd change themselves so much
just to impress somepony else.

406
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,210
If somepony doesn't like you for
who you are, it's their loss.

407
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,490
Well, this is awkward.

408
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,660
Not at all.

409
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,700
In fact...

410
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,100
I think I know
just how you feel.

411
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,840
What do you think, Rarity?

412
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,820
Is it too late to go
back to Small Town Chic?

413
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,520
Not if I can help it!
