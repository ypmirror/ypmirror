00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:41,470
and bring her back.

174
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:45,888
I have to warn you, if
you sent that letter,

175
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:48,992
the bylaws are clear;
I'd have no choice

176
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:52,690
but to ban you from the
Wonderbolts forever. Understand?

177
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,952
[sigh]

178
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:58,192
I understand. But how am I gonna
prove I didn't send a letter

179
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,520
that I didn't send?

180
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,328
With me!

181
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,912
Detective Rarity is on the case!

182
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,296
And we're going to get
to the bottom of this

183
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,940
faster than my
costume change!

184
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:11,248
Yeah, what's
with the get-up?

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,528
Obviously, I am
channeling Shadow Spade

186
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,000
through these
gorgeous garments.

187
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,984
And she would say that
the best way to prove

188
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,736
that you didn't send the letter
is to find out whoever did!

189
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,376
First stop, the
scene of the crime!

190
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,688
♪♪

191
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,488
<i>Rarity: We had a long road ahead</i>

192
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,880
<i> Well, not too long because</i>
<i> we didn't have much time</i>

193
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,288
<i> but the point is, I was</i>
<i> up for the challenge.</i>

194
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,592
There I was, surveying
the crime scene

195
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,376
and looking tres
chic while doing it.

196
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,480
This must be the envelope
for the letter Spitfire got!

197
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:55,776
[sniff sniff]

198
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:03,248
Hmm, these look like
hairs from a rainbow mane!

199
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,392
[gulp] That's not good.

200
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,712
<i>Rainbow Dash was getting antsy.</i>

201
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,840
<i> But I had faith I</i>

202
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,696

203
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:15,664
What are you doing?

204
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:17,744
Huh, oh what? Oh,
just thinking thoughts.

205
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:22,944
<i> Rainbow Dash was right. In</i>
<i> order to solve the mystery,</i>

206
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,840

<i> one hundred percent in the--</i>

207
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,008
Ooh!

208
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:31,856
The damask pattern on these
curtains is exquisite!

209
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:35,344
Oh, and this velvet
rope holder, oh it's--

210
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,648
We don't have time
to look at the decor!

211
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:39,600
They're gonna kick me
out of the Wonderbolts

212
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,024
unless we solve this thing!

213
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:43,392
I know, Rainbow, and
I am on this case

214
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,656
like a charm on a bracelet.

215
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,240
Here's what I'm thinking:

216
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:49,472
somepony had to bring
Spitfire that letter,

217
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:52,912
which means somepony
must have seen them!

218
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,032
I just have a few
questions for you

219
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:01,024
and I'm sure once we get some
things cleared up, we'll--

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,520
C'mon, Rarity; we
don't have all day!

221
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,448
Where were you on the night
of last night at midnight?

222
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,512
We were here, guarding
the hallway entrance

223
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:09,424
like we were supposed to.

224
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:11,280
A likely story.

225
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,296
I'm telling you, we
were there all night

226
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:15,840
and no one went in or
out of that hallway.

227
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:18,048
Except for you.

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,520
What are you trying to say?

229
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,512
Just that there are only two
rooms in the northwest wing:

230
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:24,140
yours and Spitfire's.

231
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:28,624
So the only other pony who had
access to that wing was you.

232
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,080
<i>The waters were getting choppy.</i>

233
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,680
<i> Rainbow Dash's tactics</i>
<i> were... well, horrid.</i>

234
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:38,096
<i> It was time for</i>
<i> another approach.</i>

235
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:41,056
Perhaps I should
take it from here.

236
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,976
You castle guards have
such a difficult job.

237
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:51,376
I'm guessing that at times,
it can be rather boring.

238
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,000
[softly] It is. I've counted all
345 bolts in the ceiling tiles

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,248
293 times.

240
00:12:57,808 --> 00:13:01,310
And of course, being a castle
guard can be thankless work.

241
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm not saying you did,
but if you took a break,

242
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,704
you more than deserved it.

243
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,952
Aw, you're right, we don't
get a lot of recognition

244
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:10,720
for what we do.

245
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
Except for last night when
somepony was nice enough

246
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,890
to leave a cake for us.

247
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:18,090
So we did take one little
break when we ate that cake.

248
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,664
What kind of cake was it?

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,104
Cherry with a
custard filling.

250
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,592
Was the frosting
vanilla or chocolate?

251
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,104
Chocolate.

252
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,136
Was it decorated with
buttercream rosettes?

253
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:25,856
It was!

254
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:28,976
Ugh. Who cares how
it was decorated?

255
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,360
<i> Rainbow Dash was</i>
<i> questioning my methods,</i>

256
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:33,248
<i> but I knew what I was doing.</i>

257
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:34,128
Do you?

258
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:37,910
Oh. Did I say that
one out loud?

259
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:40,980
I mean, even I think I'm
guilty at this point.

260
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,424
I really did want
to fly in that show!

261
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:45,552
What if I wrote that
note when I was asleep?

262
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,624
Do you know what I do when I
sleep? Because I sure don't!

263
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:52,544
Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

264
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:54,896
There's only one
bakery in Canterlot

265
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,056
that makes a chocolate cherry
cake with custard filling

266
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:59,296
and buttercream frosting
rosettes, and that's...

267
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,512
...Cinnamon Chai's
Tea and Cake Shop!

268
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,940
[British accent]
Hello, how can I help you?

269
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:08,512
I've heard you have the best
chocolate cherry custard cake

270
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,592
with buttercream frosting
rosettes in town!

271
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,184
Oh! You travel in
the right circles.

272
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:16,032
We have the only chocolate
cherry custard cake

273
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:18,496
with buttercream frosting
rosettes in town.

274
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,936
Oh, no! But somepony's
already bought it.

275
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
Who was the lucky pony?

276
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:26,992
I can't even say!

277
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,904
Why? Because it was
somepony famous?

278
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,656
No! Because it
was hard to tell.

279
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:37,168
She was wearing a trenchcoat,
sunglasses, and a scarf

280
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,696
around her head that
covered most of her face.

281
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:44,000
But I do remember she had a
really deep, raspy voice.

282
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,224
Rainbow Dash: What do
you mean raspy?

283
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:48,800
Well, kinda like yours.

284
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,448
If there's anything else
you can remember, dish!

285
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,600
Well, have I got
a story for you!

286
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,824
The pony who bought the
cake threw a big fit

287
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:01,264
when she accidentally got
chocolate ganache on her scarf.

288
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:04,512
That's terrible! What
color was the scarf?

289
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:08,800
White. No, maybe
more of an ivory.

290
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:10,464
You don't say!

291
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:13,792
I can't believe you're talking
fashion at a time like this.

292
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,408
Rainbow, don't panic.
I need you to trust me.

293
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,832
Trust you? You've spent
more time changing clothes

294
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,664
than trying to help
me. I'm doomed!

295
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,608

but Spitfire wasn't
at her mom's house.

303
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,016
Where could she be?

I've found the culprit!

306
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:08,928
Somepony sent Spitfire away and
framed Rainbow Dash for it.

307
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,800
And that pony was none
other than... WIND RIDER!

308
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:16,128

310
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:24,176
Rarity, I can't believe you
would accuse Wind Rider

311
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:25,040
of framing me.

312
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:27,840
He's a living legend,
for pony's sake!

313
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,336
All the evidence points to him.

314
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,440
What evidence could
you possibly have?

315
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,512
All you did was ask
about cake, admire decor,

316
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,608
and change outfits
a gazillion times.

317
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:39,632
Let me explain.

318
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:42,432
I never believed you
would send Spitfire away.

319
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,744
And when we found the rainbow
hairs in Spitfire's room,

320
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:49,584
I could tell they didn't
fall out; they were cut!

321
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:53,264
No pony loses hair in a chunk.

322
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,272
And look at the ends;
it's a straight line!

323
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,384
They were clearly
cut with shears!

324
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,640
Which means somepony planted it.

325
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,584
Then, when we were examining
Spitfire's room...

326
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:08,032
...I smelled something on the
envelope. Juniper Phoenix!

327
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,260
Wind Rider's cologne of choice.

328
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,944
Then, in the castle hallway,
I noticed some of the damask

329
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:17,104
curtains fell out of
their velvet rope holder,

330
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:20,544
indicating that somepony had
been hiding behind them,

331
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,472
perhaps after they dropped
off the fake letter.

332
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,224
Juniper Phoenix is a
very popular fragrance

333
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,544
and anypony could have
moved those curtains.

334
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,920
Precisely why I questioned
the castle guards.

335
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:34,400
They were at their post at
the entrance to the hallway

336
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,632
all night except for
a small window of time

337
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,760
when somepony brought them cake.

338
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,816
A cake that was ordered by a
girl pony with a raspy voice.

339
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,344
Whoever ordered the cake
got a chocolate stain

340
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:51,280
on their ivory scarf, and
I couldn't help but notice

341
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:54,128
Wind Rider's scarf is tied
in a tight Windsor knot

342
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:56,464
instead of its usual
loose slipknot.

343
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,744
And why is that? Is it to
hide... the chocolate stain?

344
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,380
[gasps]

345
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,632
This is preposterous.

346
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:08,640
Wonderbolts, you don't
believe a word of this, right?

347
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:12,416
Just admit it! You're as
guilty of framing Rainbow Dash

348
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,608
as you are of ruining
that ivory scarf!

349
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,352
Fine. You caught me! I did it.

350
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,800
But why, Wind Rider?

351
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,848
Is it because I took
the last broccoli

352
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:25,500
at the dinner and you
really really wanted it?

353
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,528
No. It was because he was afraid

354
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:31,856
that you would break his long
distance Wonderbolt record.

355
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,112
I heard him when Spitfire said

356
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,664
you were close to
breaking his record.

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,400
He said and I quote, "heh heh."

358
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,152
That's the polite but
disingenuous laugh you make

359
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,520
when you want to seem happy
but really you're not.

360
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:45,872
I thought if I could
get Rainbow Dash

361
00:18:45,872 --> 00:18:47,552
kicked out of the
Wonderbolts forever,

362
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,690
my record would be preserved.

363
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:53,160
Really? That is so not cool.

364
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
I thought you were the coolest
Wonderbolt ever until now.

365
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,616
I did what I had to do
to protect my record.

366
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,272
Sometimes, you gotta play
dirty to be the best.

367
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,752
That's not what being a
Wonderbolt is all about.

368
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:06,048
She's right!

369
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,240
Wonderbolts look
out for each other.

370
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:11,360
Which reminds me,
where is Spitfire?

371
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,176
I sent her the letter
pretending to be Stormy Flare.

372
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,944
I told her I had Pegasitus
and the only cure

373
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:19,360
is the Ice Iris in
the Crystal Mountains.

374
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:21,664
No wonder she's
been gone so long.

375
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,848
Ice Irises are almost
impossible to find in spring!

376
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,096
The Crystal Mountains are too
far for anypony to make it there

377
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,968
and back before the
Royal Garden opening.

378
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:33,830
Rainbow Dash, we need you
to fly in Spitfire's place.

379
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,632
But Spitfire shouldn't have to
miss this. I'm gonna get her.

380
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:39,360
Well, you'll never
make it in time!

381
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,936
Then there's no time to lose!

382
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:46,250
♪♪

383
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:48,576
Rainbow Dash is still gone!

384
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:49,472
Oh, don't panic.

385
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:52,368
If I know Rainbow Dash,
she'll come through.

386
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:53,568
[door opens]

387
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:56,920
[panting]

388
00:19:57,536 --> 00:20:00,496
Spitfire, you're back! I
can't believe you made it!

389
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:04,272
Oh, I wouldn't have, if Rainbow
hadn't found me so fast.

390
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:06,336
Gave me enough time to fly back!

391
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,168
Rare, I couldn't have
done it without you.

392
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:11,168
And I'm sorry
I doubted you.

393
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,600
But why didn't you tell
me what you were doing?

394
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:16,032
Well, I didn't want to get your
hopes up until I was sure.

395
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,864
And I couldn't be sure until
I saw that chocolate stain.

396
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:20,610
Thank you for believing in me...

397
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:24,704
...even when I was doubting
you. I'm some friend, huh?

398
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,880
Actually, you're
quite a good friend.

399
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,224
You went to get Spitfire,

400
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,320
even though it meant
you couldn't fly today.

401
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:33,344
[sigh] I'll get
my chance one day.

402
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:37,536
Or today. How'd you like Wind
Rider's spot in the show?

403
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:41,300
What? You can't
do this to me.

404
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,288
I'm one of the greatest
Wonderbolts there ever was!

405
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:47,856
Not anymore. For attempting
to frame Rainbow Dash,

406
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:51,152
I hereby strip you of
your Wonderbolt status!

407
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,208
So would you like
to fly with us?

408
00:20:56,864 --> 00:21:00,390
Would I? Woo-hoo!
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

409
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,328
Uh-huh, Uh-huh!
Yeah! Oh, YEAH!

410
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,940
Uh, Rainbow Dash?

411
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,672
[sheepish]

412
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,224
Coming!

413
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:15,280
<i> Rarity: So my friend got</i>
<i> her moment in the sun.</i>

414
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:18,256
<i> Or the center of an aerial</i>

415
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,952

417

Stormy Flare:
That's nice, dear.

418
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,904
Oh. Did I say
that out loud?
