1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,330
Oh ho! But
that's not all!

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,700
When I went to look for them
again, they were on the ceiling!

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, Discord, I've never known
anypony as funny as you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,320
I love that story about the
time you tried to train your right paw...

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,000
...to fetch your left leg!

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,080
Oh, I do love our Tuesday Teas.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,120
And I can't wait for you to
meet my friend, Tree Hugger.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,050
She's going to love you, too.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,600
Tree Hugger? Ah ha ha!

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,020
I met her on a trip
to see the Breezies.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,070
She's a member of the Equestrian Society
for the Preservation of Rare Creatures.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,800
How nice for you.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,770
We're all going to have so much fun
together at the Grand Galloping Gala!

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,570
Oh! I was wondering when
you were going to ask me!

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,520
I'd love to!

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,570
Oh! Oh no.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,470
Um. I'm afraid I've already
asked Tree Hugger.

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,450
I'm sorry, Discord.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,270
I assumed you'd have your own ticket since
you and Princess Celestia are friends now.

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,030
Were you not invited?

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,620
Who, me? It probably got
lost in the mail.

22
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,950
No BIGGIE, as the foals say.
Well, gotta go!

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,820
But we haven't had any
of our Tuesday Tea cakes.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,950
Well, I guess we're just goingto have to
EXCLUDE them from our party this time!

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,920
Oh! Oh, did I say that out lou--

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,450
I mean, ta ta.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,220
Regular Subtitles by YayPonies
We have Muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

28
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,650
Gah, aah!

29
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,950
Where's Twilight?

30
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,170
Uh, she's in Canterlot, helping
Princess Celestia with the Gala.

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,970
Oh, your first
Grand Galloping Gala!

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,200
The excitement,
the anticipation!

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,350
I wouldn't miss this for
all the jewels in Equestria!

34
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,020
We're going to the Gala!
We're going to the Gala!

35
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,050
We're going to the Gala!

36
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,300
All right y'all, keep it down.

37
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,800
It ain't like it's a life
changing experience or nothin'--

38
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,220
My little sister's
all grown up!

39
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,770
Hey!

40
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,000
This is going to be
the best night ever!

41
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,670
Aaaah!

42
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,600
I don't suppose that uh, these adorable
little cutie pies have their own tickets

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,500
to the Gross Gruesome
Gala, do they?

44
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,300
To answer your
rather rude question,

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,050
they're going as
our dates.

46
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,670
Our plus ones!

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,450
We're plus ones!

48
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,200
We're plus ones!

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
Yes, yes, yes.

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
I believe I got that!

51
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,220
Yeah!

52
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,500
Have a wonderful,
special, fantastic day!

53
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,350
Oh, hi Discord!
Want some cake?

54
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,450
I can give you a list of all
of the flavors we have

55
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,500
in order of most delicious

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,120
to incredibly,
unbelievably delicious!

57
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,570
Actually, Pinkie Pie, who
are you taking to...

58
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,950
I mean, do you...

59
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,670
Oh, you know what?
I AM famished!

60
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,300
I'll take all the cakes!

61
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,870
ALL OF THEM? HE WANTS
ALL OF THE CAKES!

62
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,820
Well, I'll need all my energy
when I'm dancing at the Gala...

63
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,570
IF I decide to go, that is.

64
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,300
Oh, by the way, are
you bringing anypony?

65
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,850
Oh, of course!

66
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,150
I WAS going to ask my mom
because she's, you know, MY MOM,

67
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,450
but it turned out she
didn't want to go,

68
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,620
so I started asking around and
around and around

69
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,320
and I couldn't think of anypony and
I was about to just go by myself

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,800
but then I realized OF COURSE!

71
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,820
Who loves fancy, exciting
affairs more than anypony else?

72
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,470
My sister MAUD!

73
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,300
You know what?

74
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,120
Cancel my order!

75
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,750
You want NONE of
the cakes now?

76
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,420
Oh my, you are funny.

77
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,480
I guess every being in
Equestria is funny today.

78
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,650
Oh, how rude of me.

79
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,520
Tree Hugger, this
is Discord.

80
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,220
Discord, Tree Hugger.

81
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,850
Radical to meet you.

82
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,020
Really digging your vibe.

83
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,600
My vibe?

84
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,490
It's a compliment.

85
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh well, I'm
sure it is!

86
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,920
Well, I must be off!

87
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,950
It has nothing to do with
seeing you or not seeing you,

88
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,750
you can rest
assured of that!

89
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,600
Have fun at the Gala!

90
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,520
Righteous.

91
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,850
Oh, Tree Hugger, you're
such a great friend!

92
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,870
So much funnier than
unfunny old Discord!

93
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,050
No no, here, take my plus one!

94
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,700
I insist!

95
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,670
Before somepony else
thinks he's my friend

96
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,250
and expects to be
asked instead!

97
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,850
What's that?

98
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,870
You're worried Discord
might be upset?

99
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,620
Not a problem!

100
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,020
I can make more new
friends any time I want!

101
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,370
It's not as if any of
this actually mattered!

102
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,220
I don't even want to
go to the Gala anyway!

103
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,870
Are you perhaps looking for ME?

104
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,670
Are you...

105
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,120
..."Discord or
current resident?"

106
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,850
I can't find any street
numbers in this place.

107
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,370
My ticket to the
Grand Galloping Gala!

108
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,820
I WAS invited after all!

109
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,220
Why is this so late?

110
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,100
Well, I got a little lost after
I escaped the flying badgers.

111
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,270
Can you point me in the
direction of the bottomless pit?

112
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,870
I think I can make my
way back from there.

113
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,520
Oh, over there somewhere.

114
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,730
Just, just go over there.

115
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,200
Looks like I'll see you at the
Gala after all, Fluttershy.

116
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,800
But I can't show up alone.

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
She'll think that
she's my only friend!

118
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,870
Who could I bring on
such short notice?

119
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,300
I must say, it's been very nice
having you take over some of the

120
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,800
planning responsibilities
for this year's Gala.

121
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,370
Anything I can do to
make it easier on you.

122
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,600
Thank you, Twilight.

123
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,670
I am quite looking forward to
just enjoying the Gala for once.

124
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,200
Announcing, the spirit of
chaos, Discord, and his guest,

125
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,600
the...uh...

126
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,170
...the Smooze!

127
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,300
Good evening, everypony!

128
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,370
What a glorious affair!

129
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,300
He does have a yen for
shiny things, the rascal!

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,100
I'll take care of this.

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,820
What are you doing
here with...that?

132
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,070
Now, now, now!

133
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,770
The Smooze may be an "it" but
it's an "it" with a heart of,

134
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,650
well, blob.

135
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,380
This night is extremely
important to me, Discord.

136
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,770
Keep it under control.

137
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,670
Yes yes yes, of course.

138
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,700
Tell me, have you seen
Fluttershy anywhere?

139
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,200
We're here! We're here!
We made it to the Gala!

140
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,120
Really?

141
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,800
...the aura coming off the
waterfall was so alive!

142
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,750
So like, magic in
manifestation...

143
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,800
Wow.

144
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,400
Oh, Fluttershy!

145
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,620
I didn't see YOU there!

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,700
How did you even know to look
for an aura on a waterfall?

147
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,420
Discord!

148
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,150
I thought you weren't coming!

149
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,420
No, I actually
never said that.

150
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,400
But funny how you
remembered it that way.

151
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,370
Anyway, good to see
you...Tree... Friend, is it?

152
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,100
Your name is slipping my
mind right now. How strange.

153
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,470
Nice to meet you;
I'm Tree Hugger.

154
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,420
Blessings.

155
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,470
You have met me
before, actually.

156
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,350
Cool.

157
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,850
Like in another
life, maybe?

158
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,350
You've got to be kidding!
You don't remember me?

159
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,550
Ha ha. I meet a LOT of
different creatures.

160
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,000
Each one of them
perfect and unique.

161
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,920
Yes, well, as I was saying,
it's just great to be here

162
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,200
with my oldest, bestest friend.

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,370
Am I really your
oldest, bestest friend?

164
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,550
YOU?

165
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,720
Of course not!

166
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,970
You think I don't
have other friends?

167
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,120
I'm CENTURIES old!

168
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,320
I was talking about the Smooze!

169
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,120
Smoozeface, the Smoozenator.

170
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,450
Well I mean, that's what we
called him back in college.

171
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,450
Smooze, I would like you to
meet Fluttershy and um,

172
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,120
Tree... what is
it...oh, Tree Embrace?

173
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,120
Oh, I like that.

174
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,720
It's so in rhythm
with my life force.

175
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,050
Maybe I'll change it!

176
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,250
I can't believe I've never heard
you speak of the Smooze before.

177
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,820
It sounds like you
two are so close.

178
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,670
Well, I'm glad you got that,
because that's what is true.

179
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,020
We ARE very close.

180
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,550
That's wonderful!

181
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,850
The four of us should go
out to dinner sometime!

182
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,070
We should all go out
to dinner sometime?

183
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,370
Have you no heart?

184
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,670
Oh, oh. It looks like
somepony wants to mingle!

185
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,770
We'll be back in a bit.

186
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,850
Oh, Okay.

187
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,470
Treezy and I would love
to talk to you more later.

188
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,420
TREEZY?

189
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,450
Really?

190
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,200
Sort of a juvenile
nickname, don't you think?

191
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,400
Smoozie!

192
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,820
Wait up!

193
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,570
Now listen, Smooze, I need
to make this a party of one

194
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,720
for a little while.

195
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,500
Just stay out here
until I come for you.

196
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

197
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,150
What's so funny?

198
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,650
Exactly!

199
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,370
Uh...I think we're gonna
go hit the dance floor.

200
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,020
Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here
about the time that we went to

201
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,150
the store and came back with
TWO cakes instead of one

202
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,620
because that's how crazy we
are when we're together!

203
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,550
Um, we went to the
store and got two cakes.

204
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,850
Oh. Well, you kind of
left out all the fun and frivolity there,

205
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,320
but I'm sure you
got it, Tree Hugger.

206
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,120
I got that you
really like cake.

207
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,950
We like each other.
THAT was the point!

208
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,650
I'm actually pretty
lukewarm about cake.

209
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,050
Let me in!

210
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,920
That creature took my jewels!

211
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,820
Discord!

212
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,250
I thought I told you to keep
your friend under control!

213
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,750
Oh please, I have
better things to do

214
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,720
than to watch that
THING all night.

215
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,300
What I mean to say is, that
thing is a dear, dear friend

216
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,220
and I'll make sure
that the ooze

217
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,970
that he can't help but secrete
doesn't get on anypony else.

218
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,420
Thank you.

219
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,520
It's all right, everypony!

220
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,770
Let's just get back to
enjoying this magical evening!

221
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,150
You are making me look like a
fool in front of Fluttershy!

222
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,900
I'll be back when
the Gala is over.

223
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,620
Oh, Tree Hugger!

224
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,650
I've never known
anypony as funny as you!

225
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,100
Check, check, check.

226
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,170
Is this thing on?

227
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,100
Good evening,
fillies and germs.

228
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,920
I just flew into Canterlot

229
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,750
and wow are my
inter-species parts tired!

230
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,070
I've only got these tiny
mismatched wings

231
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,200
and even I can fly better than
Twilight Sparkle, am I right?

232
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,420
Hey!

233
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,920
Well, perhaps you're into
more observational humor.

234
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,100
Did you ever notice how
you always materialize

235
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,300
out of thin air?

236
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,020
Why not thick air?

237
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,250
What's the deal there?

238
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,500
Tough crowd.

239
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,500
What is he doing?

240
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,370
I think they're... jokes?

241
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,920
Maud! Jokes!

242
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,200
My favorite.

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,870
Knock knock!

244
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,770
You're supposed to
say "who's there!"

245
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,520
This is the most basic
of jokes!

246
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,100
You're the most basic of jokes.

247
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,350
Good one, Maud!

248
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,970
What is that?

249
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,170
None of my magic
works on this ooze!

250
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,450
Can you stop it?

251
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,950
I'm afraid not!

252
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,320
Discord, how could
you bring him here?

253
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,620
Oh, he's not that bad.

254
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,700
Oh! My shoes will be
ruined forever!

255
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,400
That's what you're
worried about? Really?

256
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,370
This is kind of
a bummer.

257
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,600
Isn't it, though?

258
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,700
And to think, it never
would have happened

259
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,570
had I come to the Gala as
somepony else's plus one.

260
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,670
Seems like something might
have harshed his flow, ya know?

261
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,870
Like his senses are agitated.

262
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,550
You don't know anything
about rare creatures.

263
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,770
I've known
Smoozeface for ages!

264
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,170
He's not agitated;
he's partying down!

265
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,070
All he needs is some, like,
calming auditory therapy.

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,920
I know I always feel
really at peace

267
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,370
when I'm being bathed
in positive vibes.

268
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,550
Maybe he'll calm down
with some sonic bliss.

269
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,450
Do you even KNOW
what you just said?

270
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,670
<i>Ommmm! Eeeeeeee.</i>

271
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,700
<i>Ommmmm. Eeeeeee.</i>

272
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,900
Let go, Smooze. Bliss out.

273
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,700
<i>Eeeeee!</i>

274
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,500
<i>Ommmm.</i>

275
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,700
<i>Ommmm! Eeeeeeee.</i>

276
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,120
It worked!

277
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,800
Way to go, Tree Hugger!

278
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,800
That was the most magical thing
I've ever seen done with animals!

279
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,100
Oh thanks, everypony.

280
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,950
It makes perfect karmic sense
your magic doesn't work on him.

281
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,050
He only responds to vibrations
that peace out his energy fields.

282
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,800
Stop it!

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,870
Stop it!

284
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,720
That's it!

285
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,850
I am done with you, Tree Hugger!

286
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,320
Oh, man.

287
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,420
You're really bummin' me out.

288
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,000
Can you just like, lower
your voice a skosh?

289
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,220
A skosh?

290
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,700
A SKOSH?

291
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,170
Whoa, dude. What is THAT?

292
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,770
Relax, I'm not
going to hurt you.

293
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,320
I'm simply going to send
you to another dimension.

294
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,470
I can't have you interfering

295
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,650
in my relationship with
Fluttershy anymore.

296
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,720
Discord?

297
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,750
Stop!

298
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,900
I will!

299
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,100
Just as soon as she's gone!

300
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,170
Then we can have a good laugh
about this whole affair

301
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,620
over our regular Tuesday Tea!

302
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,870
Don't worry, Fluttershy,
we'll stop him!

303
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,270
I'm doing her a
favor, Fluttershy!

304
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,850
It's a lovely dimension!

305
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,850
White sand beaches, an
attentive waitstaff.

306
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,720
I mean, Okay, the
humidity isn't great,

307
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,000
but where isn't that
the case these days?

308
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,650
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

309
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,100
We were all getting
along so well!

310
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,350
As well as we could,

311
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,670
considering you've already
stomped all over our friendship

312
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,920
by inviting her to the
biggest night of the year

313
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,000
as if I didn't matter at all!

314
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,270
Did you really think
I'd abandon you

315
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,320
just because I
have a new friend?

316
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,050
Yes!

317
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,670
Because that's
what you did!

318
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,820
No, Discord.

319
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,120
I invited a friend
to a party.

320
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,120
I didn't abandon you.

321
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,950
What if you had a friend that you could
discuss chaos-based magic with?

322
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Would that mean we
weren't friends anymore?

323
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,300
No, I suppose not.

324
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,850
It would just mean that
I'd have different friends

325
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,950
for different things. Oh!

326
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,120
Oh dear.

327
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,120
It looks like I've perhaps
overreacted just a skosh.

328
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,750
More like a lot of skoshes.

329
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,600
Tree Hugger, could
you give us a minute?

330
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm just so new at this
whole friendship thing!

331
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,750
It's so much more
complicated than it looks.

332
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you think maybe you
owe somepony an apology?

333
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,620
Not ME!

334
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,500
Oh, oh.

335
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,520
Ahem, Yes, right.

336
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,970
Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you
got caught in the middle of my,

337
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,520
you know, wrath.

338
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,500
Oh, it's all groovy.

339
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,950
Um, I need like a few minutes
to clear out my chakras

340
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,220
before I can hug you from a
place of authenticity.

341
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,620
Oh, your chakras, yes.

342
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,370
Fair enough.

343
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,170
I owe you an apology, Smooze.

344
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,450
I spent the whole evening
thinking about my own feelings

345
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,500
and never thinking about yours.

346
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:37,950
Well, friends!

347
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:44,675
I think I may actually grow to
like this multiple friend thing!

348
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
I like it too.

349
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:49,750
Hey, it's not a party until
somepony spreads magic-resistant

350
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,075
ooze uncontrollably
over the ballroom!

351
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,950
Come on, Smoozinator,
let's dance!

352
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,225
I'm sorry,
Princess Celestia.

353
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,600
I thought I could give
you a break tonight,

354
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,875
but it turns out I
was in over my head.

355
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:08,750
You have nothing
to apologize for.

356
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,350
This has been the most
fun Gala in years!

357
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,625
I know, it
was a-- WHAT?

358
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,925
But there was ooze
all over the place...

359
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,350
and one of the guests threatened to
send somepony to another dimension.

360
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,400
I know!

361
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,975
Can you imagine how dull it would
have been if I hadn't invited Discord?

362
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,375
Come on!

363
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,450
The night is still young!
