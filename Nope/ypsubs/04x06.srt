1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,070
Spike, you really need
to go to sleep.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,330
Two more minutes, Twilight?

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,080
I'm just getting to
the really good part.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,480
The Mane-iac is about to--

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,600
The Mane-iac?

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,410
The Power Ponies'
most evil nemesis.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,470
She was the power-mad owner
of a hair-care product company.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,640
A tragic accident at her shampoo
factory in Maretropolis

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,940
not only gave her mane
strange new powers,

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,300
but also caused her to go...

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,720
...completely insane!

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,460
She and her henchponies
are planning to break into

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,720
the Maretropolis Museum
and steal the Electro-Orb

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,370
so she can use it to power
up her doomsday device.

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,790
Of course, the Mane-iac
wouldn't have even known

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,300
if Hum Drum hadn't slipped
up and told her all about it.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,880
Hum Drum?

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,820
Guy in the blue boots
and pointless red cape.

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,240
The Power Ponies' bumbling
and totally useless side-kick.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,490
The Power Ponies have
to stop the Mane-iac

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,600
or Mare-tropolis is doomed!

22
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,040
Believe me, Spike, if anypony
understands what it's like

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,340
to get caught up in a
really good book, it's me.

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,550
But if we're going to make
any progress fixing up

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,520
Luna and Celestia's old
castle tomorrow,

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,290
we all have to
do our part.

27
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,420
We don't want to be too
tired to lend a hoof.

28
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:17,810
Or claw.

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,120
OK. OK. I'm going to bed.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,900
Good-night.

31
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,910
Two more minutes.

32
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,970
Yes!

33
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,500

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,810
Looking good, everypony!

35
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,110
Let's keep this magical
make-over moving.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
You got it.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,270
Good ol' Spike is here
ready to do his part.

38
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,130
A little more to the left!

39
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,020
No, the other left!

40
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,340
Awesome! That's perfect
right where it is!

41
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,800
On to the next painting.

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,980
You sure you don't
need any help?

43
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,380
Naw. That's OK.

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,040
We've got everything
under control!

45
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,650
Dash?

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm good.

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,180
Isn't there anything
I can help you with, Twilight?

48
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,400
Don't worry about it
Spike; it's all good.

49
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,660
I think she's right.

50
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,280
It looks like we've
got it, Spike.

51
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,840
Looking great, everypony!

52
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,060
Why don't you find a quiet spot
and finish reading your comic?

53
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,270
Weren't you right at the part

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,220
where Hum Drum was about
to stop the villain?

55
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,850
Hum Drum never
stops the villain.

56
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,790
He's just there
for comic relief.

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,100
Rarity, let me give
you a hoof with that.

58
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,390
I could do it.

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,770
That's OK, Spike.

60
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,940
<i>Pony Power!</i>
<i>Wheeee!</i>

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,390
Mane-iac breaks
into the museum...

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,780
OK. Here we go.

63
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,160
What a surprise, Hum
Drum is in the way again

64
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,950
while the Power Ponies
do all the work.

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,760
I guess I know what
that feels like.

66
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,630
Wait.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,030
What? How can
that be the end?

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,970
What's that?

69
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,940
You can retry.

70
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,520
What? You can return.

71
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,630
I know I saw a magnifying
glass lying around

72
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,720
last time I was here.

73
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,050
<i>Spike! Where are ya,</i>
<i>Spike!</i>

74
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,350
<i>We're breaking for</i>
<i>tea and biscuits!</i>

75
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
<i>Spike!</i>

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,730
You can return to the
place you started

77
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,900
when the Mane-iac
is defeated.

78
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,270
Huh?

79
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,100
Take a closer look...

80
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,940
...to join the
adventure in this book?

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,290
What does that even mean?

82
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,180
Whoa! Cool!

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,470
Spike! What are you--

84
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,720
Help!

85
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,110
Spike!

86
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,160
Wheee!

87
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,960
Is this Maretropolis?

88
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,250
<i>Somepony wanna tell</i>
<i>me what the hay is going on?</i>

89
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,810
Holy new
personas, ponies!

90
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,550
<i>You're the Masked Matter-Horn.</i>

91
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,940
<i>Fili-Second.</i>

92
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,560
<i>Zapp.</i>

93
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,290
<i>R... Radiance.</i>

94
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,760
<i>Mistress Mare-velous.</i>

95
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,260
<i>Saddle Rager.</i>

96
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,630
You're the Power Ponies!

97
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,300
Power Ponies!

98
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,710
How kind of you to join us.

99
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,930
Huh?

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,260
Did she just call
us "Power Ponies"?

101
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,480
You're the...

102
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,740
the superheroes
from my comic book.

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,590
It somehow zapped
us all in here.

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,890
So somepony zap us
back out.

105
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,720
My comic book...

106
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,740
It said the way to get
back to where we started

107
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,220
was to defeat the Mane-iac.

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,690
Your arch-nemesis.

109
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,860
Time for the mane event!

110
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,270
<i>Pinkie! Where'd she go?</i>

111
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,950
Wheeeeeee!

112
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,130
She could be miles
away from here by now.

113
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,490
Pinkie is Filli-Second,

114
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,020
the fastest pony in
all of Maretropolis.

115
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,430
Twilight, freeze her mane!

116
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,880
Do what?

117
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,530
You're the Masked Matter-horn.

118
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,400
You can shoot all kinds of crazy
power beams from your horn!

119
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,090
You know, I'm beginning
to enjoy this.

120
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,550
Dash, quick!

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,590
You're Zapp and your
super-power is controlling

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,030
the mighty forces of nature!

123
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,930
Unholster the lightning bolt!

124
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,230
Lightning! Not a tornado!

125
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,490
Fluttershy, you're Saddle Rager!

126
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,390
Lose your temper
and you'll turn into a huge,

127
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,840
super-strong monster!

128
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,760
Oh. Gosh. That wouldn't
be very polite.

129
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,140
Rarity, use your jewelry
to create attack constructs.

130
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,100
What's an attack construct?

131
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,410
Just think of
something... anything...

132
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,940
and your bracelet
makes it appear.

133
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,590
Something useful!

134
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,090
The Electro-Orb!

135
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,550
Well, this has been quite the

136
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,380
mane-raising experience,

137
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,760
but I really must be going.

138
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,600
Why, thank you, Hum Drum.

139
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,580
I'm Hum Drum?

140
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,830
Oh, no!

141
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,270
Applejack! You gotta
help stop the tornado

142
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,750
from destroying the city!

143
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,790
But every time I move, this
darn lasso gets tighter.

144
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,640
You're psychically
connected to it.

145
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,370
Will it to where you
want it to go...

146
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,590
and it'll obey you.

147
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Haha, That was spintastic!

148
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,790
Let me get this straight.

149
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,800
We've been sucked
into some kind of...

150
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,530
comic book world?

151
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,840
Technically,
it's called Maretropolis.

152
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,780
And if we want to get
back to Ponyville,

153
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,140
I think we have to
stop the Mane-iac

154
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,420
from using her doomsday
device to destroy it.

155
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,830
No biggie. I was
already awesome.

156
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,750
And now we've all
got super powers.

157
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,810
Almost all of us
have super powers.

158
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,870
But you must have
them too, Spikey-boo,

159
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,470
your character is
wearing a cape.

160
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,520
Yeah. For absolutely
no reason.

161
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,670
He's pretty much useless.

162
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,430
Good thing you're not
really Hum Drum then.

163
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,780
Yeah. Good thing.

164
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,870
So the six of us "Power Ponies"
will take care of Mane-iac

165
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,300
and get us back to Ponyville.

166
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,980
Spike, where is the Mane-iac
building her doomsday device?

167
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,910
Her top secret headquarters.

168
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,200
But you'd better
get there quick.

169
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,300
That glowing orb she just stole
is what she's going to use

170
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,340
to power it up.

171
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,040
Lead the way, Spike.

172
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,630
Then leave the rest to us.

173
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,860
<i>There it is.</i>

174
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,860
Is that a... shampoo factory?

175
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,810
All right, Power Ponies,
here's the plan.

176
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,130
Rarity, you, me and--

177
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,020
<i>Come on out,</i>
<i>Mane-iac!</i>

178
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,280
Or the Power Ponies
are coming in.

179
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,510
So much for
element of surprise.

180
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,050
Guess I'll just hang back
here doing nothing.

181
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,450
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>she's home.</i>

182
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,350
Maybe we should just
come back later.

183
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
She's home.

184
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,850
Time to "Power Pony Up".

185
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,690
Oooh. Nice catchphrase.

186
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,010
Freeze Ray!

187
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,660
It's an improvement, darling.

188
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,230
Hee hee hee! Ha ha!

189
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,870
Oh, I do so love a
functional accessory.

190
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,070
My hair!

191
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,910
Seriously?

192
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,190
You aren't even just a
little angry right now?

193
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,630
<i>Nice work,</i>
<i>Power Ponies.</i>

194
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,020
Now let's take care of the
Mane-iac and get ourselves home.

195
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,430
I don't think so.

196
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,600
I have a city to destroy.

197
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,890
And I'm not about to let
the Power Ponies stop me.

198
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,060
Not this time.

199
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,740
Just watch us.

200
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,070
The Hair Spray Ray of Doom!

201
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,760
It stops you in your tracks
and renders your powers useless!

202
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,510
We'll just see about that.

203
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,700
Fluttershy, please!

204
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,320
Just a little anger?

205
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,300
Well, I'm not so much
angry as I'm concerned,

206
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,000
bordering on terrified.

207
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,610
Don't spray!

208
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,960
Oh, Hum Drum, why in
all of Mare-tropolis

209
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,080
would I use the Hair
Spray Ray of Doom on you?

210
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,160
Rather pointless,
don't you think?

211
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,070
<i>What am I supposed</i>
<i>to do? I'm useless.</i>

212
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,810
No wonder my friends never need
<i>me to do anything important.</i>

213
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,080
<i>They're the ones with</i>
<i>the super powers.</i>

214
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,920
They've probably already
figured out how to escape.

215
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,690
Or not.

216
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,180
Congratulations, Power Ponies.

217
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,410
You shall live just long
enough to see me fire ...

218
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,580
the instrument of
your destruction!

219
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,340
Once the Electro-Orb
has powered it up completely,

220
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,600
this cannon will amplify
the power of my mane

221
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,430
one million times,

222
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,960
<i>expelling an energy blast</i>

223
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,280
<i>that will cause everypony</i>
<i>in Mare-tropolis' mane</i>

224
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,170
<i>to grow wild!</i>

225
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,570
You will be my weapon's
first victims,

226
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,280
<i>and there is nopony who can</i>
<i>save you from this fate!</i>

227
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,980
<i>Ahem.</i>

228
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,560
I don't mean to interrupt,

229
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,450
but aren't you forgetting
about somepony?

230
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,490
Hum Drum? Little guy?

231
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,750
No superpowers whatsoever?

232
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,050
He's utterly useless.

233
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,090
Please! Everypony knows you
just keep him around

234
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,770
because you feel
sorry for him.

235
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,850
Wah Wah!

236
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,060
Maybe in your world.

237
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,110
But in our world
Spike- uh, Hum Drum,

238
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,860
always comes through
when we need him.

239
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
Always.

240
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,810
I'm not like Hum Drum.

241
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,570
When my friends really
need me, I do come through.

242
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,630
And they need me now.

243
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,350
I see dementia
must be a side-effect

244
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,850
of prolonged exposure to
the Hair Spray Ray of Doom.

245
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,430
Tonight we stand upon the
brink of immortality,

246
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,510
for we collectively -
though mostly me -

247
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,600
<i>have finally defeated our</i>
<i>most hated nemeses.</i>

248
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,120
<i>We have hurled the</i>
<i>brush of badness</i>

249
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,750
into the now fearful face of...

250
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,980
<i>goodness, and have struck</i>
<i>a blow for freedom,</i>

251
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,890
<i>in the name of oppression!</i>

252
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,570
And nothing will stop us!

253
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,610
Way to go, Spike!

254
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,990
Get mad!

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm trying.

256
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,410
Grrrr.

257
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Tag! You're it.

258
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,750
Tag! You're it.

259
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,530
Tag! You're it.

260
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,510
Tag! You're it!

261
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,020
Over there!

262
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,900
There, THERE! IDIOTS!

263
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,270
Need a place to put these guys!

264
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,370
Hold it right there, partner.

265
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,400
Fluttershy, where are you going?

266
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,290
You seem to have
everything under control.

267
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,010
Fluttershy, we need you!

268
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,380
<i>You have to power up.</i>

269
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,990
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,270
It's just that nothing
is making me mad.

271
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,460
Oh, goodness.

272
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,890
Are you OK?

273
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,670
Are you kidding me?

274
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,490
I mean, I know you're evil
and everything.

275
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,790
but you'd hurt a teensy, little
harmless fire fly? Really?

276
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,680
<i>WHY, YOU'RE JUST A</i>
<i>GREAT BIG... MEANIE!</i>

277
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,170
THERE, I SAID IT!

278
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,080
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL?

279
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,520
LIKE THE RULES OF COMMON
COURTESY DON'T APPLY TO YOU?

280
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,170
WHY DON'T YOU PICK
ON SOMEBODY YOUR OWN SIZE!

281
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,910
Huh?

282
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,280
<i>My mane!</i>

283
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,520
My mane!

284
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,330
Once again, the
day is saved by--

285
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,540
Did you see how I was raining
down a storm of justice

286
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,420
at the end there?

287
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,600
You catch how I was
wieldin' that lasso?

288
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,750
Cupcakes?

289
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,290
How did you--?

290
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,200
We had a good half-second before
we got sucked back out

291
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,990
of the comic and The
Mare-tropolis bakery

292
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,090
was only 65 blocks away.

293
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm just glad to be back.

294
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,560
We wouldn't have made
it without you, Spike.

295
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,050
And I hope you realize

296
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,050
that just because we don't
always need your help,

297
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,310
it doesn't mean that we
don't think you're helpful.

298
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,880
And that you don't have
to have super powers

299
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,300
to be a super friend.

300
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,510
But I do have one question.

301
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,170
Where exactly did you
get that comic book?

302
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,080
This one I got in Canterlot at
The House of Enchanted Comics.

303
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,940
Well, I didn't know it meant
they were literally enchanted.

304
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,780
I thought it just meant like,
the comics they sold there

305
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,450
had really enchanting
story lines.

306
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,760
Hey wait up! I'm an important
part of this team; remember?
