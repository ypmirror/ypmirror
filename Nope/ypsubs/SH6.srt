1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,870
Okay, Granny,
one more time.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,290
When ya accidentally
sold my bass at the garage sale,

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,920
who did ya sell it to?

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,170
I sold it to the owners
of that new pawn shop.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,590
Uh, Flibbity Flabbity,
somethin' like that.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,060
Welcome to the grand opening of
the Flim Flam Brothers'

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,930
Everything Under the Sun Emporium!

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,350
- If you want it...
- ...we've got it!

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,060
- Need a pogo stick?
- A bowling ball?

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,690
- A stuffed clown?
- Whatever this is?

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,650
I'd like that bass.

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,610
I can give you this bass for a
non-negotiable price of one thousand dollars.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,530
Why, you only paid
Granny Smith two dollars for it!

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,830
Yes, well, we have to cover
our overhead and transportation costs.

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,870
Listen, Granny never
should've sold my bass.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,380
I'll give ya the two dollars back
and we'll call it even.

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,920
Likely story!

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,510
It is.
That's my bass.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,590
And can you prove that
this is, in fact, your bass?

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,010
Her initials are monogrammed
right on the strap.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,270
That could mean anything.
It could stand for...

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,560
"Aardvark Junior"...

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,060
- "Anvil Jokers"...
- Or "Animal Jane".

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,310
Why, I'll bet you don't even
play the bass, Applejack

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,400
- if that is your real name.
- Of course that's her real name!

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,240
And she does play the bass!

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,760
Perhaps this is her bass.

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,390
But there are still
the transportation costs and overhead.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,100
- Don't forget the stocking fees.
- Wouldn't dream of it, brother!

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,940
Then again, I suppose
we could make some sort of

31
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,190
trade?

32
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,660
Come on down to the grand opening
of the Flim Flam Brothers'

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,120
Everything Under the Sun Emporium.

34
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,750
Since when
do you play the bass?
