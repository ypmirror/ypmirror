1
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:12,444
Can you believe Featherweight
got his cutie mark?

2
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,725
Featherweight! Before us!

3
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,160
Great cutie mark, Featherweight!

4
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:23,488
Looking good!

5
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:26,055
I give up...

6
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:27,306
I've got it!

7
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:31,125
The answer to all our problems!

8
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:33,131
The Foal Free Press?

9
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:35,931
How's the school paper
gonna get us our cutie marks?

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,961
Move your caboose!

11
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,509
That's Granny Smith. Gotta run!

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,765
Maybe there's something
to this newspaper idea.

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,574
Guess it's worth a shot...

14
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:13,700
Apple Bloom, your newspaper idea
was nothing but a big bust.

15
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:18,826
We tried everything, from papier-mâché
to making birds nests and nothing worked.

16
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:23,345
What's so funny?

17
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:26,665
What I meant was,
we should write for the paper!

18
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:29,795
We can get our cutie marks as journalists!

19
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:39,435

Okay class, see you tomorrow!

23
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,562
Oh, and for those of you who want
to join the newspaper staff,

24
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:16,245
stay here because we're meeting right now!

25
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:18,215
Cutie marks in journalism!

26
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,970
Such a good idea.

27
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:21,321
Welcome, everypony.

28
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:25,156
Now, as you know,
our editor-in-chief graduated last year.

29
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:28,253
Yes?

30
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:29,745
What's an editor-in-chief?

31
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:34,045
Good question, Sweetie Belle,
I like those reporters' instincts.

32
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:38,077
The Foal Free Press
is a student-run paper.

33
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:40,095
I'm only involved as an advisor.

34
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:43,295
So the editor-in-chief
is the pony in charge.

35
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,905
From choosing the stories,
to making sure it gets to press on time.

36
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:51,855
Now, as I said,
we have a new editor this year!

37
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:55,845
Diamond Tiara?!

38
00:02:57,294 --> 00:03:00,395
I'll leave you alone now to discuss
everypony's assignments.

39
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:01,646
Have fun!

40
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:04,995
Alright, listen up.

41
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,945
The Foal Free Press is a joke.

42
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:11,474
Nopony at this school takes it seriously.

43
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,595
Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge,
am gonna deliver us to newfound glory!

44
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:19,312
Yay!

45
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,755
First things first,
where's the staff photographer?

46
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:25,103
Get out there and document everything.

47
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:27,145
I'll decide what's important.

48
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:30,962
The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news
and interesting thinkpieces.

49
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:34,026
No more namby-pamby stories
like last year's editor.

50
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:36,609
But Namby-Pamby was a great editor.

51
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,500
Well, there's a new regime now,
and I want juicy stories.

52
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,851
The juicier the better!

53
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,806
Now get out there and report!

54
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:47,069
Let's get out of here, girls.

55
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,312
Maybe we can try packing boxes again.

56
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,747
But this could be our last chance
to earn our cutie marks!

57
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,355
If we really are supposed
to be journalists,

58
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:57,342
isn't it worth a little grief?

59
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:58,693
I guess you're right.

60
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:02,203
We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara
for a lifetime of cutie marks.

61
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:05,009
C'mon! Let's go get those marks!

62
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:08,794
<i>My first story's gonna be
an exclusive interview.</i>

63
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:26,455
<i>I saw a brand new nest
of baby birds the other day.</i>

64
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:29,753
<i>I bet our readers would eat up
a sweet story like that!</i>

65
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:40,295
<i>Granny Smith has all sorts
of great stories!</i>

66
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,341
<i>I reckon I'll do a piece
on the history of Ponyville.</i>

67
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:02,511
I hope you've got something,
because everything so far is unusable.

68
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:06,959
"Baby Birds Born...?"
"Rarity's Hot New Hat...?"

69
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,832
"Ponyville, The Early Years...!?"

70
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:15,204
I don't know what you call this,
but it sure isn't news!

71
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:16,812
We just... thought...

72
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:19,646
Get something else on my desk
by the end of the day,

73
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:22,068
and it better be juicy!

74
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:31,121
Now what? Do you know what
I had to do to get that story?

75
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:34,951
Oh, you don't even wanna know
what I had to sit through.

76
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:38,482
Get it off me, Snails!

77
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:41,897
Yeah, you get it off me, Snips?

78
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:45,167
Stop it! You are making it worse!

79
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:48,995
Oh, great.

80
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:50,294
I'll get it.

81
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,541
Get it off! Get it off!

82
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:58,728
Hey, Featherweight, c'mere!

83
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:03,206
Take a few pictures of this,
then meet me during lunch.

84
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:07,502
Girls, I have our story.

85
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,295
<i>Snips and Snails in bubblegum fails!</i>

86
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:15,676
"And that's when the biggest jokester
in school really stuck his hoof in it..."

87
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:16,995
"... literally!"

88
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:20,682
The Foal Free Press is usually
just boring news and stuff.

89
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,446
So funny!

90
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:25,675
Our mothers always told us
we'd end up in the papers someday.

91
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:27,002
Yeah, and look!

92
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,696
We finally got the gum out!

93
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,395
Your column is a sensation!

94
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:34,996
I don't want you doing news anymore.

95
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:37,425
I want more columns like this.

96
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:41,109
Columns about ponies
and their private lives...

97
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,390
The things they do when
they think they're alone...

98
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:47,017
You three are my new gossip columnists!

99
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:50,594
And I love the way you signed it!

100
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:54,495
Gabby Gums...
that was a stroke of genius!

101
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:56,095
We couldn't fit all of our names.

102
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:59,265
So we decided to create one
for all three of us.

103
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,345
Well, I want more Gabby Gums!

104
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:03,596
Nice work, girls.

105
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:06,674
But we sure seem
to have a gift for gossip.

106
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:10,068
If we can write a few more
of these Gabby Gums columns,

107
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:12,500
we'll earn our cutie marks for sure!

108
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:19,995
Scootaloo...? Do you have anything?

109
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,146
Nope.

110
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,486
Apple Bloom?

111
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:26,194
Sorry.

112
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,545
Let's face it, nothing very juicy
happens at this school.

113
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,745
We're doomed.

114
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:50,277
Sweetie Belle... was she raised
in a barn or something?

115
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,735
You really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity.

116
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,652
Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity.

117
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:04,434
Hello... what's this?

118
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:07,800
Gum on their bum!

119
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:09,764
Too rich!

120
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:12,958
Can you please keep it down
with all the laughter?

121
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,101
I'm trying to- hey!

122
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,452
I was just...

123
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:19,702
Are you snooping through my saddlebag?

124
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,232
How dare you!

125
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:30,602
Oh, but this Gabby Gums
column is so funny!

126
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:33,716
You actually like the school paper?

127
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:38,714
It's so much juicier than anything
in the boring old Ponyville Express.

128
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,628
Could I borrow this to show my friends?

129
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,152
Your friends would wanna read
the Foal Free Press?

130
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:47,842
Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums!

131
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,193
Who is she, anyway?

132
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,720
I've never heard of her before.
Is she a new-

133
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,601
We gave up too quickly, girls.

134
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,910
Forget trying to squeeze stories
out of this school.

135
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:02,062
We need to expand!

136
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:05,558
We can find all kinds of great gossip
out there in Ponyville!

137
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,566
We'll need to tell Featherweight
to start working overtime.

138
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:11,361
Sweetie Belle, you're a genius!

139
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,506
<i>"Pound and Pumpkin Cake trip
to the store ends in tears."</i>

140
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:23,251
Gabby Gums comes through again!

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,205
The Ponyville news stand
wants to carry the Foal Free Press!

142
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:29,369
Ponies keep coming by and asking for it!

143
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,649
Send 'em twenty copies,
and if they run out of those,

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,750
we'll send 'em twenty more!

145
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:37,030
You three are doing
a great job for this paper.

146
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:39,626
Keep those columns coming!

147
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,400
This is great!

148
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls?

149
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,982
The best hooficure I've ever had!

150
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,505
You said it.

151
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,223
I don't know if I've ever been
so relaxed.

152
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:21,374
You guys!

153
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,369
The new Gabby Gums just came out!

154
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,900
<i>"The Great and Powerful Trixie's
secrets revealed!"</i>

155
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,630
We already read that one, Rainbow Dash.

156
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:34,870
Come on, relax, have a hooficure,
it feels amazing.

157
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:36,958
Did you forget who you're talking to?

158
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:40,465
The day I get a hooficure
is the day I turn in my daredevil license.

159
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:43,205
Besides, I haven't read
this Gabby Gums yet.

160
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:46,243
Well, do it quietly, will ya?

161
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,750
Some of us are trying to unwind!

162
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:53,950
I like Gabby Gums too, but don't
you think she can be a little mean?

163
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,100
She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!

164
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:59,200
<i>"Celestia, just like us?"</i>

165
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:02,481
Gabby Gums doesn't value
anypony's privacy.

166
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:06,633
Oh, lighten up, Twilight,
there's nothing but harmless gossip!

167
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,201
Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one.

168
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,001
<i>"Mayor, not naturally gray!"</i>

169
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:14,520
"The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal?"

170
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,475
Who wouldn't wanna read that?

171
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:19,900
I just can't help feeling sorry for
the ponies featured in her columns.

172
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,317
It's gotta be a little embarrassing.

173
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:23,468
Are you kidding?

174
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:26,049
Do you know how awesome it is
to get your name in the paper?

175
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,690
Rainbow, why don't you join me
in one of these delicious hooficures?

176
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,923
It's that good, huh?
Well, maybe just one little hoof.

177
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,690
Forget it, I don't like ponies
touching my hooves.

178
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,200
Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums
did a story on me.

179
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:58,651
She did one on me.

180
00:11:58,802 --> 00:11:59,802
What?!

181
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:03,926
<i>"Exclusive! Local dragon tells all."</i>

182
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:08,900
"Spike opens up about Canterlot,
naps, and his favorite jams!"

183
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:10,760
It's our best column yet!

184
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:13,850
More like your worst column yet!

185
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,250
Gabby Gums didn't become
the biggest thing in Ponyville

186
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,688
with namby-pamby stories like this!

187
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,525
Yeah, she's right.

188
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,443
This column is a little softer
than our usual gossip.

189
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,880
Were you guys feeling guilty
about all the gossip too?

190
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:34,314
Like... maybe we could be
hurting other ponies' feelings?

191
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:39,685
Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because
everypony loves Gabby Gums so much,

192
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:44,011
but... I was sorta hoping we could start
writing more stories like this one.

193
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:45,462
Me too.

194
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:50,902
If we're gonna get our cutie marks,
we've got to give the ponies

195
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:52,053
what they want.

196
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,751
<i>"Applejack, asleep on the job!"</i>

197
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,610
Can y'all believe this?!

198
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:00,485
And this one:

199
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:03,322
<i>"Big Macintosh, what's he hiding?"</i>

200
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:06,081
Who the hay does this Gabby Gums
think she is?

201
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,332
Listen to this one.

202
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:10,850
<i>"Twilight Sparkle, I was a Canterlot snob."</i>

203
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:14,253
"A well-placed scaly source
close to the prissy pony says..."

204

is nothing but muddy roads..."

205
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,401
"... and low-class rooves."

206
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:20,752
Spike!

207
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,862
How could you say such a thing?

208
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:27,248
Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up!

209
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,599
I never said anything like that!

210
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,838
Everypony, please!

211
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:34,676
She's just a harmless schoolpony
engaged in a little idle gossip.

212
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:37,483
You're really making too big a deal
out of this.

213
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,395
But it's all lies!

214
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:41,499
Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants.

215
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,031
She doesn't care whose reputation
she destroys!

216
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,470
<i>"Fluttershy has tail extensions!"</i>

217
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:52,376
<i>"Pinkie Pie is an out-of-control
party animal!"</i>

218
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,527
What?!

219
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:58,455
It's true! I do have a problem!

220
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:02,750
Oh look! According to this one,
the Cakes are breaking up!

221
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,501
We are?!

222
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,578
Well, my life is officially... over.

223
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:11,200
Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale.

224
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:14,990
<i>"Rainbow Dash,
Speed demon or super softie?"</i>

225
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:18,365
I grabbed as many copies as I could,
but it was too late!

226
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:21,079
I'm a laughing stock!

227
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,524
See, Rarity?

228
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:26,009
Your so-called 'harmless gossip'
can be very hurtful!

229
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,360
Honestly, you ponies
have no sense of humor.

230
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:32,629
So she tweaks a few ponies
every now and then,

231
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
maybe they deserv-

232
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:37,200
I'll destroy her!

233
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:38,741
<i>"The drama queen diaries."</i>

234
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,492
She's reprinted my diary!

235
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:44,160
How could Gabby Gums possibly
get access to my private diary?!

236
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,937
We've got to put a stop to this
once and for all!

237
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:49,240
Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff.

238
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,676
Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is!

239
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,660
My sister would never associate
with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums!

240
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:00,367
I resent you even suggesting
such a thing, Twilight!

241
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:04,860
Why, she's the most innocent,
most lovely...

242
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:08,218
... most evil pony in Equestria!

243
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:11,678
My own sister steals my private diary.

244
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:16,608
How could my own sister be...
Gabby Gums?

245
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,067
<i>Et tu, Gabby Gums?! </i>

246
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,936
You know?! How'd you find out?!

247
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:31,770
The gilded pages of your betrayal!

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,121
Oh yeah.

249
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,262
How could you do this to me?!

250
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:40,088
You stole my secret diary and published it
for all the world to read!

251
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,299
Gossip can be a very hurtful thing.

252
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,207
It is an invasion of privacy, just like
when I snooped through your saddlebag.

253
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:48,253
You didn't like that much, did you?

254
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:49,404
No...

255
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:53,079
What is important is that you understand
how your column makes the ponies

256
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,847
that you're writing about feel!

257
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:58,030
I do understand,
and we've all been feeling guilty.

258
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:00,784
But we just want our cutie marks so badly!

259
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,663
Do you really think that
writing nasty things

260
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:07,030
and making everypony feel horrible
is your destiny?

261
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:09,704
Well, when you put it that way...

262
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:10,855
No!

263
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:12,979
I won't let you quit!

264
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,854
But the gossip we've been printing
is hurting everypony's feelings!

265
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:20,185
Feelings? I don't care about feelings!

266
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,590
Gabby Gums is my bread and butter.

267
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,700
And I'm not gonna let you
goody two horseshoes

268
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,151
take that away from me!

269
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,666
We're sorry, Diamond Tiara,
but we've made our decision.

270
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:32,887
Yeah, you can't force us
to keep gossiping.

271
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:35,578
When you see these...

272
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,615
You may not want to quit after all.

273
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:46,705
I told Featherweight
to document everything...

274
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,398
And that's exactly what he did.

275
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,983
Gimme those!

276
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:59,039
Sorry, girls, property of
the Foal Free Press.

277
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,691
And if Gabby Gums really
does go into retirement,

278
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:06,112
I'll need something to fill
that empty column space.

279
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,900
Now get out there
and bring me more Gabby Gums!

280
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,280
We'll find a way out of this, girls.

281
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:17,636
Maybe Rainbow Dash
will have a story for us.

282
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,287
She's always good for some gossip.

283
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,046
Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!

284
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:26,466
Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums.

285
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:28,017
You heard too, huh?

286
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:29,158
Are you kidding?

287
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,776
Everypony in town knows it's you three.

288
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,941
Don't suppose you'd let us
write a column on you, huh?

289
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,630
Oh, hi Angel, is Fluttershy home?

290
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,224
Hey, what gives?

291
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:04,620
Twilight thought you might try
to show your faces around here,

292
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,612
so she put up a force field.

293
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,928
Aw, c'mon, Applejack!

294
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,120
You're not mad at us too, are you?

295
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:14,271
Yup.

296
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,501
You're not even gonna talk to us?

297
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:17,652
Nope.

298
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:21,755
You should be ashamed of yourself,
humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that.

299
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:23,741
We don't wanna talk to
any y'all right now,

300
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:26,930
so take your little gossip column
and your embarrassing photographs

301
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:29,508
and just go away!

302
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,150
We've ruined all of our friendships
and we still don't have our cutie marks!

303
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,282
This is the worst day ever!

304
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,625
Oh yeah? Wait 'til tomorrow.

305
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:52,273
Our most embarrassing moments
are about to be published

306
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,600
for everypony to laugh at.

307
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,400
So, what do we do?

308
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:57,919
I don't know.

309
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,375
We're not leaving this clubhouse
until we think of something!

310
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,100
That's it, Gabby Gums is out of time.

311
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,451
Run these instead.

312
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:15,213
I want this paper on every
street corner in Ponyville!

313
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,664
Yes, ma'am!

314
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:19,720
Stop the presses!

315
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:22,040
Uh, they haven't started yet.

316
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,248
We have a Gabby Gums column!

317
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,982
You're lucky I'm nice.

318
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,911
This better not happen again, or else.

319
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,800
Well done, Diamond Tiara.

320
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:47,637
You've averted yet another crisis
with your amazing diplomatic skills.

321
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,379
<i>"An open letter to Ponyville
by Gabby Gums"?! </i>

322
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,730
What is this?!

323
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,377
They're not gonna get away with this!

324
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,915
I'll publish those photos tomorrow!

325
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,875
They messed with the wrong pony!

326
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,923
<i>To the citizens of Ponyville.</i>

327
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:10,639
<i>For some time now, you've been reading
this column to get the latest dirt </i>

328
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,990
<i>and the hottest buzz.</i>

329
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:14,407
<i>But this will be my final piece.</i>

330
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,170
<i>We want to apologize for the pain
and embarrassment we've caused.</i>

331
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:21,012
<i>Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies.</i>

332
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:23,713
<i>Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo.</i>

333
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,427
<i>As the popularity of our column grew,
we got swept up in the hype.</i>

334
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:32,195
<i>We knew that what we were
doing didn't feel quite right,</i>

335
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,700
<i>but we ignored the guilt,
because everypony </i>

336
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:37,062
<i>seemed to want to read
what we were writing.</i>

337
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:42,252
<i>From now on, we promise to respect
everypony else's privacy.</i>

338
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:45,406
<i>and we won't engage
in hurtful gossip any more.</i>

339
00:20:45,557 --> 00:20:48,706
<i>All we can do is ask for
your forgiveness, Ponyville.</i>

340
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:54,299
<i>Signing off for the very last time,
XOXO, Gabby Gums.</i>

341
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,012
Well, staff, I guess I gave
a little too much authority

342
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,663
to a first-time editor.

343
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,004
I'm sorry, Diamond Tiara,
I have to strip you of your title.

344
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,778
And for the next editor
of the Foal Free Press...

345
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,720
Here's your new editor-in-chief,
Featherweight!

346
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,816
Oh, him? But what about me?!

347
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:26,558
Here ya go! I've been promoted
to staff photographer!
