Maud, I can't help
but notice you're staring

176
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,680
at that marvelous giraffe.

177
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
I was just wondering,

178
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,160
any chance you could
see yourself with it?

179
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,320
Only if I had a mirror.

180
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,900
Now Maud, I know you're
a big fan of rocks,

181
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,520
so get your camera ready

182
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,260
because these are the
most spectacular rocks

183
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,580
in all of Manehattan.

184
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,320
Surely there must be something
here that catches your eye.

185
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,060
Boulder says they're
all too "stuck up".

186
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,900
[whistle]

187
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,620
All right. You and me, Maud.

188
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,040
You and me.

189
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,860
What do you think about this?

190
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,080
Or this? Or this? Or this?
O this? Or this? Or this?

191
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,260
This? This? This?

192
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,100
This-this-this-this-this
-this-th is-this-

193
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,240
I like that.

194
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,900
What is it? You have to tell me!

195
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,900
Was it this bike? This
lamp? This grappling hook?

196
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,600
What do you like?

197
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,260
I like that fissure
in the sidewalk.

198
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,160
It's an elegant example
of thermal expansion

199
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,520
and soil settlement.

200
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,760
[mumbling] WHAT!?

201
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,940
But I... all of this...
and she likes a crack?!

202
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
Did she like anything?

203
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,120
That sister of yours is simply
impossible to shop for.

204
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,440
There's nothing
she needs or wants.

205
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,540
Boulder? Boulder?
Where'd you run off to?

206
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,640
There you are.

207
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,920
Sure wish I had something
to carry you around in.

208
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,440
A rock pouch was a
perfect gift for Maud!

209
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,100
And I know she would
have loved the one I saw

210
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,360
in the window! It had double
stitching, a red drawstring--

211
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,940
--and ochre-flecked
velvet lining

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,400
with reinforced triple
crosshatched seams?

213
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,300
Yep. That's the pouch.
Wait. How'd you know?

214
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,860
Because I'm looking
at one just like it.

215
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,880
Maybe if you catch up
with him, you could ask-

216
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,260
Excuse me, Sir.

217
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,840
I couldn't help but notice
your nifty rock pouch.

218
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,880
Is there any chance you'd
be willing to part with it?

219
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,340
I really need it. Like,
really, really, REALLY!

220
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,760
So lemme get this straight.

221
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,700
You really, really
need this pouch, huh?

222
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,700
I believe I said,
really, really, REALLY!

223
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,840
Well, you know
pouches like this

224
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,820
are really hard to
come by these days.

225
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,660
But I might be able to part
with it for the right price.

226
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,180
So you'll sell it to me?

227
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,740
And I'll finally be
able to give my sister

228
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,060
the perfect Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day present?

229
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,140
Ooh, thank you, thank
you, thank you!

230
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,780
[poof!]

231
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,280
Hmmmmm. That's one sweet
party cannon you got there.

232
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,120
Tell you what. I'd be more
than happy to give you

233
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,380
the pouch for the low, low
price of... that cannon.

234
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,080
My, my party cannon?

235
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,040
Well, if you really want to
give that sister of yours

236
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,540
the perfect present,

237
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,860
then you'll have to give
up your party cannon.

238
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,360
So what do you say? The
pouch for the cannon.

239
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,500
Do you see the exposed
chalcedony in the fissure?

240
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
Probably?

241
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,100
Whatcha guys looking at?

242
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,600
Oh, you're back.

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,420
Darling, I want to get
one more picture of you

244
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,580
and that astounding
fissure in the sidewalk.

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,680
And the inspiration
just struck me

246
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,060
for the perfect shot!

247
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,960
Be a dear and go
stand behind it.

248
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,160
OK, now just back
up a little bit.

249
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,960
Little more.

250
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,490
And now just a little...
twenty yards more.

251
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,080
Perfect! Hold that pose!

252
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,880
I think we found your
new holiday card!

253
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,180
So, how did it go? Tell
me, tell me, tell me!

254
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,100
Well, I got the
rock pouch for Maud.

255
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,420
That's really the only
thing that matters.

256
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,340
Oh, I am so glad
to hear that!

257
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,200
She's going to
absolutely LOVE it.

258
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,940
Yep.

259
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,440
Yep? That's it?

260
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,540
You got your sister the
greatest PSSSD present

261
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,580
in the history of ever

262
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,900
and all you have
to say is 'yep'?

263
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,880
Yep.

264
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,440
But you're Pinkie Pie.
You're supposed to be all--

265
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,640
I'm so excited I
got the rock pouch!

266
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,120
And I know I say
'excited' a lot

267
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,220
when I'm actually just kind
of excited, but this time

268
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,480
I'm really excited about how
excited I am about being

269
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,700
this excited over
the rock pouch!

270
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,360
And then you fire off
your party cannon.

271
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,940
Say, where is your cannon?

272
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,140
[gasp] Did you lose it?

273
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,780
Is your party cannon lost
somewhere in the big city?

274
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,360
Well, I wouldn't say it's lost.

275
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,020
I mean, I know where it
is, it's just... [sigh]

276
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,980
I can clearly see that
something's bothering you

277
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,320
and I want to help.
But I can't help you

278
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,600
unless you tell me
what the problem is.

279
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,200
Oh there's no problem.
It just turns out

280
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,420
that the going rate for a
rock pouch in Manehattan

281
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,820
is one party cannon. Who knew?

282
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
YOU GAVE AWAY YOUR CANNON?

283
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,680
B-but that party cannon
is your everything!

284
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
You absolutely
love that cannon.

285
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,680
How could you possibly
part with something

286
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,020
that means so much to you?

287
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,840
Well, I finally got Maud a gift

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,220
that's just as good as the
ones she always gets me.

289
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,580
And that's all that
really matters.

290
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,080
Well, I guess I
understand. Maybe?

291
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,500
Maud's going to be so excited.

292
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,280
I can't wait to see
the look on her face

293
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,720
when she sees the pouch!

294
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,840
I know. The camera
loves Boulder.

295
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,020
After the day we've had,

296
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,260
I'm probably looking
forward to the "swap" part

297
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,860
of the Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day

298
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,300
even more than the
two of you!

299
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,020
And I'm not even
a Pie sister!

300
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,360
I can't wait one
more second to see

301
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,260
the wonderful gifts
you've gotten each other.

302
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,760
Well, you're going have to.
We don't just swap, silly.

303
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,420
We always sing the Pie Sister
Surprise Swap Day Song first.

304
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,520
Ready, Maud?

305
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,020
As I'll ever be.

306
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,080
<i> ♪ It's the Pie Sister</i>
<i> Swap Day Song! ♪</i>

307
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,920
Hey.

308
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,280
OK. Time to swap presents!

309
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,500
Hmmmmm.

310

311

Thanks.

313
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,280
I knew you'd love it!

314
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,260
It was all worth it!
Look how happy she is!

315
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,840
And I couldn't have
done it without you.

316
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,080
Thank you, Rarity.

317
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,620
OK, time to open
your present to me!

318
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,880
Uh! You did it again!

319
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,260
You got me the best present
in the history of PSSSD!

320
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,740
This is perfect. This is
amazing. This is incredible!

321
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,600
I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!

322
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,800
What is it?

323
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,840
It's little pieces of
cupcake-scented paper.

324
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,280
You know. Confetti.
For your cannon.

325
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,840
Maud, you know me so well.

326
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,240
You really are the most
thoughtful gift-giver

327
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,080
in the world.

328
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,600
I'm going to love it five-ever.

329
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,060
That's even longer than forever.

330
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,920
You're right.

331
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,180
That is impressive, but it's
no fissure in the sidewalk.

332
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,820
Play nice.

333
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,720
Oh, I'm so relieved to see that
you like the pouch. Especially

334
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,460
considering what Pinkie
Pie had to give up for it.

335
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
[gasp]

336
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,780
What?

337
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,340
I mean, forget I said that.

338
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,360
I'm-I'm glad to
see you like pouch.

339
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,340
You can remember that part.
Just forget the second part.

340
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,820
You know, the second part
where I said Pinkie Pie

341
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,760
had to give something
up for it. [gasp]

342
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,040
I should just stop
talking now. Nothing!

343
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,040
Hee-hee! Yay!

344
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,700
I love my sister
and my new confetti!

345
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Why isn't she using
her party cannon?

346
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,240
Uh.

347
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,280
Ooh wow, look how
filthy my hooves are.

Pinkie Pie feels badly that
the gifts she always gives you

are never as good as
the ones you give her.

What?
