You must journey

expected of you.

353
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,740
Besides, you'll
make a great leader.

354
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,240
I was just doing this
to protect the ponies,

355
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,100
but I know you'll protect them
just as well as I would have.

356
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,690
Are you sure about this?

357
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,300
Absolutely. My home is in
Equestria with my friends.

358
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,460
Well, you'll have at least
one friend here, too.

359
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,340
What are you doing?

360
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
It's called a hug.

361
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,440
Oh. I don't know if
I like it, but OK.

362
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,480
Aw.

363
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,820
Ember? You?

364
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,160
I know you didn't think
I could do it, but I did.

365
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,220
I expressly told you NOT TO
DO IT! Because you're not--

366
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,600
--I'm not big and strong!
I know! But you know what?

367
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,460
I won anyway. So, maybe it
takes more than just being

368
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,720
big and strong to be
a good Dragon Lord.

369
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,250
I was wrong, Ember.

370
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,080
You might not be big, but
you are strong. And smart.

371
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,900
And perhaps that counts
for more than I thought.

372
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,660
And you will make
an excellent leader.

373
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,960
Thanks, Dad.

374
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,440
AGREE WITH HIM!

375
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,200
Just kidding. That's
not gonna be my thing.

376
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,370
[laughter]

377
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,710
Dragons, hear me!

378
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,900
I present to you our new
Dragon Lord... Ember!

379
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,350
[cheers]

380
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:58,489
<i> ♪ [trumpet fanfare] ♪</i>

381
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,240
What is the meaning of this?

382
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,460
I can't tell you!

383
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,320
[laugh]

384
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,320
You did well, Spike. With
Ember as Dragon Lord,

385
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,300
the ponies will be safe
and you've gained us

386
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
a powerful ally.

387
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,770
And a new friend.

388
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,540
Plus, Ember said I could
write to her any time

389
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,380
I had questions
about dragon culture!

390
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,580
With this much information,

391
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,920
I'll be able to write a
whole book on dragons!!

392
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,220
And I gained tons of
ideas for a new line

393
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,780
of camouflage clothing! I
think I'll call it camo-mod.

394
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,720
