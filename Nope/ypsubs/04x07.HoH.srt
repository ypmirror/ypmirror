I'm sorry, Fluttershy,
but I believe Applejack

113
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:44,798
has made the
better argument.

114
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:48,536
These vampire fruit bats
sound downright dreadful.

115
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:50,206
So let's get to
roundin' 'em up

116
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:52,208
so that they don't destroy
the rest of my orchard.

117
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,876
Fruit bat round up!
Fruit bat round up!

118
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:59,385
Um, excuse me, but what if
instead of rounding them up,

119
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,520
we let them have part
of the orchard.

120
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,062
Have you lost your
pest-lovin' mind?

121
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:08,560
They're only here
because they're hungry.

122
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,680
If we built a
sanctuary for them,

123
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,778
they could have their
own apples to enjoy.

124
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,755
After a while, they
could even help

125
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:16,232
the rest of your orchard.

126
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,438
The Vampire bats don't eat
the seeds of the apples

127
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,899
and when they
spit them out,

128
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:24,156
they grow into even more
productive apple trees.

129
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:27,617
Listen, Fluttershy, that
sounds real nice and all,

130
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,938
but every second we spend

131
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:31,018
buildin' this
so-called "sanctuary"

132
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:33,719
is a second they'll spend
destroyin' orchard.

133
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,424
You don't know
what it was like

134
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:37,400
the last time there
was an infestation,

135
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,312
but Granny Smith has told
me enough stories about it

136
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,723
that just the thought of
it gives me nightmares.

137
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:48,696
<i>Granny says we lost a huge</i>
<i>section of orchard that year.</i>

138
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:51,322
<i>They had to ration</i>
<i>out apples all winter.</i>

139
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:53,594
What about the cider?

140
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,332
There was still
cider, right?

141
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:56,245
Not

142
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:56,977

145

No cider!

146
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:01,894
We need to round up
these monsters

147
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:03,531
and we need to do
it now!

148
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:06,359

with Apple Bloom and Big Mac

149

competition in Appaloosa,

I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but
I think Applejack is right.

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,309
I just wish there was another
way we could convince them

153
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,997
not to eat them in
the first place.

154
