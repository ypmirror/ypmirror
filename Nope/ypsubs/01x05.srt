1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,002
Hoof-biting action overload!

2
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:06,140
She was like a stunt superstar.
Flying higher and higher...

3
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:08,347
...and then Rainbow Dash
swoopped down SWOOSH...

4
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:11,404
...and right before she hit the ground,
SHOOM she pulled up WROOM!

5
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:16,845
And then she looped around and around like
WHOO WHOO WHOO WHOO
WHOO WHOO WHOO...!

6
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,529
Rainbow Dash!

7
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:32,523
Pinkie Pie? Not again...

8
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:37,662
-Rainbow Dash!
-Not now, Pinkie Pie!

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,178
But... but Rainbow Dash!

10
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:40,919
I'm in the middle of something!

11
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,204
-But...
-I said NOT NOW!

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,855
I was gonna tell you to
look out for that mountain.

13
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,516
Hi! I'm looking for Rainbow Dash.
Have you seen her?

14
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:49,840
Hi there! Have you seen Rainbow Dash?
...Okay, thanks anyway.

15
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,230
Twilight! Have you seen
Rainbow Dash anywhere?

16
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:53,456
Isn't she right up there?

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,276
Rainbow Dash!

18
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,099
That was close...

19
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,219
Hi!

20
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:28,135
Hi again!

21
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,479
I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.

22
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,508
Oh, forget it.

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,565
I toootally promise it
will be toootally fun!

24
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:56,452
Oookay.

25
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:01,863
Over to the right.

26
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:05,469
No no, a little-little left... Wait! Back to the right.

27
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:09,950
Now a little leftish while staying rightly.

28
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:11,591
STOP!

29
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,286
Maybe a few inches to the south!
Now a couple centimeters north...

30
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,354
Okay... one more smidgemeter to the...

31
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:21,755
PINKIE PIE!!!

32
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:24,977
I mean... perfect! Now wait for my signal.

33
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,037
Oh, Rainbow Dash. We startled
Spike into getting a hiccup!

34
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:52,334
Good one, Pinkie *hic* Pie *hic*! You're
always pulling a fast one *hic* on me.

35
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,881
Oh no! You're not hurt, are you?

36
00:03:56,934 --> 00:04:00,489
Na*hic*ah... Don't be *hic* silly *hic*!
Dragons are *hic* fireproof!

37
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,691
Oh. Okay. Good.

38
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:13,578
I wish the same thing *hic*
were true of scrolls.

39
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,064
Have you ever seen anything more hilarious?

40
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:26,974
I can think of one thing.

41
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:37,649
I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.

42
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:42,575
Are you *hic* kidding?! *hic* I LOVE
to pull pranks! It's all *hic* in good fun.

43
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:46,221
And Pinkie Pie lo*hic*oves
to have *hic* fun! *hic*

44
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:49,069
You know, Pinkie Pie? You're
not as annoying as I thought!

45
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:51,070
You wanna hang out?

46
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:57,857
That'd be... *HIC* I'd really... *HIC* When do...
*HIC* I mean... *HIC* Where would you...

47
00:04:58,352 --> 00:04:59,828
A simple nod will do.

48
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:11,206
-Is she even home?
-I don't know... There she goes...

49
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,270
There she is!

50
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,366
Land sakes!

51
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:24,570
Is someone over there? Who're we gonna
squirt, who're we gonna squirt?

52
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:28,229
-Fluttershy.
-WHAT?

53
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,643
Nononononono...! We can't prank
Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive.

54
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:35,462
It'll hurt her feelings.
Even the most harmless prank.

55
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,499
Yeah, you're right.

56
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,904
Huh. We need another victim,
who's made of tougher stuff.

57
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,018
So... who's it gonna be?

58
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:49,777
Oh! I've got someone in mind.
The toughest around.

59
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,308
Oh, awesome! Who? Who? Do I know them?

60
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:57,084
Oh yes! You're very close.

61
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,746
Good one, Pinkie Pie!

62
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:21,981
Rise and shine, Rainbow Dash! It's a brand
new day and we got a lot of pranking to...

63
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,927
Morning, Pink!

64
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,169
Gilda, this is my gal pal Pinkie Pie.

65
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,756
Hey. Whazzup?

66
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,900
Pinkie, this is my griffon friend Gilda.

67
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,118
What's a griffon?

68
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:39,479
-She's half-eagle, half-lion.
-And ALL AWESOME!

69
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:46,639
Gilda's my best pal from my days
at the Junior Speedsters flight camp.

70
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,292
Hey, remember the chant?

71
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:53,310
Sure. They made us recite it every morning.
I'll never get that lame thing outta my head.

72
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:55,301
Sooo...

73
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:59,592
Only for you, Dash.

74
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,871
<i>Junior Speedsters are our lives.
Skybound soars and daring dives</i>

75
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:08,092
<i>Junior Speedsters, it's our quest
To someday be the very best!</i>

76
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:16,407
Oh, that was awesome! And it gave
me a great idea for a prank!

77
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:18,116
Gilda, you game?

78
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:22,108
Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank
as much as the next griffon.

79
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,956
But Dash! You promised me we'd get
a flying session in this morning.

80
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:30,255
Yeah... Um... Well... Pinkie Pie,
you don't mind, do you?

81
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:33,092
Gilda just got here.
We'll catch up with you later!

82
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:35,762
Oh! Um... Sure, no problem!

83
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:38,543
Have fun, you guys! I'll...
just catch up with you...

84
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,671
...later.

85
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:01,580
Wow! That was sweet! Just like old times.

86
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:05,349
Yeah! Only faster. So now what?

87
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,341
-Hey there...!
-Huh?

88
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:10,194
...it's later...!
...and I caught up...!

89
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,761
Pinkie Pie, you are so random!

90
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,441
Hey Dash! Think you got enough gas
left to beat me to that cloud?

91
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,788
A race? You are so on!

92
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:28,021
One... two... three... GO!

93
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,230
Hey...!

94
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,662
-I win!
-As if! I won, dude!

95
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,794
-No way!
-Yes way!

96
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:38,597
Oh, come on! I was way ahead of you!

97
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:43,319
Wow, guys, that was really cool!

98
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:46,071
But I think Rainbow Dash beat you
by a teeny-weeny itty-bitty hair.

99
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,835
Or a teeny-weeny itty-bitty feather.

100
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,825
See? Good thing, Pinkie Pie's
here to keep you honest, G.

101
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:58,027
Okay, Dash! Last one to that cloud
up there is an oily dragon egg.

102
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,253
GO!

103
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:03,399
I think the high altitude is making you dizzy.

104
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,065
Wait! Guys!

105
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:14,253
Wow! You guys almost got
away from me that time.

106
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:23,863
So Dash. Got any new moves in your
tricktionary or are you 100% old school?

107
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:28,440
New moves? Hah! Sit back, G.,
this is gonna take a while.

108
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,724
-Hey, Pinkie. Come 'ere.
-Yeah?

109
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:36,981
Don't you know how to take
"get lost" for an answer?

110
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:39,982
Dash doesn't need to hang with
a dweeb like you now when I'm around.

111
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:42,803
You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie.

112
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:45,531
So make like a bee and BUZZ OFF!!!

113
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,104
Try matching that!

114
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:56,645
Hey! Where's Pinkie Pie and
her crazy contraption?

115
00:10:56,733 --> 00:11:01,300
Eh... She left. Something about
being as busy as a bee.

116
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:11,160
So, Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this
friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?

117
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:14,317
Um... Yeah! She keeps stealing
Rainbow Dash away...

118
00:11:14,469 --> 00:11:17,017
...she popped my balloons and
she told me to buzz off!

119
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:20,205
I've never met a griffon this mean.
Or actually, I've never met a griffon at all.

120
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:24,104
But I bet if I had, she wouldn't
be as mean and grumpy as Gilda!

121
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:25,952
You know what I think, Pinkie Pie?

122
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:30,501
-Well, I think... you're jealous.
-Jealous?!

123
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:33,819
Green with envy. Well,
in your case pink with envy.

124
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:36,088
Well, yes. Jealous.

125
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,452
Listen, Pinkie, I don't wanna upset you...

126
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:41,986
...but just because Rainbow Dash has
another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump.

127
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:45,740
I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie,
who needs to improve her attitude.

128
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,627
Improve MY attitude?!

129
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:52,580
But I... It's Gilda that...
Are you serio... ARGH!

130
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:03,441
Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda
isn't a big mean grumpy mean meanypants.

131
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:07,548
Maybe I'm just a big jealous
judgmental jealous jealousypants.

132
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:16,782
That was sweet!

133
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,388
Uh. I gotta take care of a few weather
jobs around here. Shouldn't take long.

134
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:23,761
Just hang out in town and I'll come find ya.

135
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:26,480
That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down.

136
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,622
Later!

137
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,974
A rattler! A rattler!

138
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,015
Run for the hills! Everybody protect yourselves!

139
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,537
This stuff ain't fresh, dude!

140
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:51,054
Aw, poor Granny Smith! She didn't know
it was a joke! How mean!

141
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:55,824
No, no! I can't misjudge her!
It *was* kind of a funny prank.

142
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,559
...I guess.

143
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:06,128
I *did* misjudge her! She's not only
a meanie meanpants! She's also a thief!

144
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:09,545
Nonononono... She might get it back!

145
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,296
It's just a joke!

146
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:14,618
All right, little one. This way. This way.

147
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:16,895
Mama Duck, you're free and clear.

148
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:19,356
Hey!

149
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:21,913
-Please excuse me.
-I'm walking here!

150
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:25,048
Oh... Um... I'm sorry.
I... I was just trying...

151
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,456
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

152
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,198
Why don't you just watch
where you're going, stupid?

153
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:33,791
B... but... I... I...

154
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:47,707
Please. All these lame ponies are
driving me buggy. I gotta bail.

155
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:52,107
She's a grump AND a thief AND a bully!

156
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:55,003
The meanest kind of mean meanypants there is!

157
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:59,216
I can take it, but no one
treats Fluttershy like that!

158
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:00,883
NO! ONE!

159
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:05,430
This calls for extreme measure. Pinkie Pie style!

160
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:13,316
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

161
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:15,800
Who's this Gilda I've heard nothin' about?

162
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:19,842
I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash.
A griffon. So rare...

163
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,149
You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?

164
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:26,222
Oh! Um... Well...
I'll tell you later, Twilight.

165
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,588
Welcome! Welcome!

166
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:31,755
Um... Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda...

167
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,920
Um... Do you really think
it's a good idea? I mean...

168
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:37,683
Don't worry your pretty little
head about mean old Gilda.

169
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:40,847
Your auntie Pinkie Pie's
got it all taken care of.

170
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,911
I'm a year older than you.

171
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:44,169
GILDA!

172
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:47,359
I'm so honored, to throw you
my signature Pinkie Pie party!

173
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:52,003
And I really, truly, sincerely hope you
feel welcome here among all of us ponyfolk.

174
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:06,572
Oh, Pinkie Pie! The old hoofshake buzzer!
You are a scream!

175
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:09,798
Yeah... Good one, Pinkie Pie!

176
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:12,558
Come on, G. I'll introduce you
to some of my other friends.

177
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,132
Right behind you, Dash!

178
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:16,526
I know what you're up to.

179
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,759
Great!

180
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,853
I know what you're planning.

181
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:25,315
Well, I hope so! This wasn't
supposed to be a surprise party.

182
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,559
I mean, I've got my eye on you.

183
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:32,493
And I got my eye on you!

184
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:37,413
Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda,
a long time dear friend of Rainbow Dash.

185
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:39,789
Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.

186
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,971
Please, help yourself.

187
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:49,631
Banana lemon drops. Don't mind if I do.

188
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:56,926
HOT!

189
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,356
G.! The punch!

190
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:04,379
Well, whaddya know?

191
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:07,879
Pepper in the vanilla lemon drop and
the punch served in a dribble glass!

192
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:10,696
HA! Priceless! Priceless!

193
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,760
Yeah! Hilarious!

194
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,436
Hey, G.! Look! Presents!

195
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:31,429
Spittin' snakes. Somepony pulled
that prank on me last month.

196
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,800
Ha ha. I bet I know who THAT was.

197
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:36,402
You do?

198
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,052
Cake time, everypony!

199
00:16:44,397 --> 00:16:46,130
Hey! Can I blow the candles?

200
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:50,398
Why don't we let Gilda blow the candles, Spike?
She is a guest of honor after all.

201
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:52,991
Exactly!

202
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:14,429
Relighting birthday candles,
I love that prank! What a classic!

203
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:16,809
Now I wonder who could have done that.

204
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,078
Yeah, I wonder.

205
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:23,933
Who cares? This cake is amazing!

206
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:27,081
-Spike!
-What? It's great. Try some.

207
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:30,982
Hey, G.! You're not upset about
some silly candles, are you?

208
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:35,380
No way, Dash! Like I said,
I'm down with a good prank.

209
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:37,308
Come on then. Let's have some cake.

210
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,520
Hey! I'm watching you! Like a hawk.

211
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,543
Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?

212
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:48,241
Hey y'all! It's Pin the Tail on the Pony!

213
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:49,424
Let's play!

214
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:53,552
Oh, my favorite game! Can I go first?
Can I have the purple tail?

215
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:57,907
Well, I am the guest of honor.
And I'll have the purple tail.

216
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:00,462
Yeah! Gilda should definitely go first!

217
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:01,757
Let's get you blindfolded.

218
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,500
Hey...! Wha... What are you doing?!

219
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:08,103
We're spinning you around and around and
then you can pin the tail on the pony.

220
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:10,514
Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail!

221
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:12,907
"Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail."

222
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:16,100
Huh. Yeah, right.
This is another prank, isn't it?

223
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,729
I'm going this way.

224
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,575
Wait! The poster is this...

225
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:28,341
Uh... Gilda? You pinned the tail
on the wrong end.

226
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,508
This is your idea of a good time?!

227
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,486
I've never a lamer bunch
of dweebs in all my life!

228
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,716
And Pinkie Pie, you!

229
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:45,050
You are Queen Lame-o
with your weak little party pranks.

230
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,954
Did you really think you can
make me lose my cool?

231
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:53,026
Well, Dash and I have ten times as much
cool as the rest of you put together!

232
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:56,629
Come on, Dash!
We're bailing on this pathetic scene.

233
00:18:57,328 --> 00:19:01,286
Come on, Rainbow Dash!
I said: we're leaving!

234
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,397
You know, Gilda? I was the one who set up
all those "weak pranks" at this party.

235
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,659
What?!

236
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,525
So I guess, *I'm* Queen Lame-o.

237
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:14,969
Come on, Dash! You're joshing me!

238
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:17,315
They weren't all meant for you specifically.

239
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:19,538
It was just dumb luck that you set them all off.

240
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:20,916
I should have known!

241
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,545
That dribbled cup had
Rainbow Dash written all over it.

242
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,749
No way. It was Pinkie Pie!

243
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:30,130
She set up this party to trick me up.
To make a fool of me!

244
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:33,456
Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude.

245
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:36,331
I thought a good party might
turn that frown upside down.

246
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:39,439
And you sure didn't need
any help making fool of yourself.

247
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,511
You know, this is not how I thought my
old friend would treat my new friends.

248
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,932
If being cool all you care about...

249
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,849
...maybe you should go find some
new cool friends someplace else.

250
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:54,595
Yeah? Well, you... you...

251
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,345
You are such a... a flip-flop!

252
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,821
Cool one minute and lame the next.

253
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:03,265
When you decide not to be
lame anymore, give me a call.

254
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,534
Not cool.

255
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,225
Wow. Talk about a party pooper.

256
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:16,293
I'm sorry, everypony, for bringing Gilda here.

257
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:18,398
I didn't know how rude she was.

258
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:23,208
And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined
that awesome party you put on for her.

259
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:26,570
Hey! If you wanna hang out with party
poopers, that's your business.

260
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:28,231
I'd rather hang out with you.

261
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:31,042
-No hard feelings?
-No hard feelings.

262
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:40,398
Hey, Pinkie. Sorry I accused you
of misjudging Gilda.

263
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,616
Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.

264
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:47,286
It's okay, Twilight. Even you can't be
a super smart smarty smartpants all the time.

265
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,254
Come on, everypony! There's still
a whole lot of party to finish!

266
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:55,340
"Dearest Princess Celestia..."

267
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,541
"Today I learned that it's hard
to accept when somepony you like..."

268
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,313
"...wants to spend time with
somepony, who's not so nice."

269
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:04,605
"Though it's impossible to control
who your friends hang out with..."

270
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:07,324
"...it is possible to control your own behavior."

271
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:09,479
"Just continue to be a good friend."

272
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:14,408
"In the end the difference between a false friend
and one who is true will surely come to light."

273
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,097
"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

274
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:21,680
"Dear Twilight Sparkle,
my most faithful student..."

275
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,054
Oh! Wrong ink.

276
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,809
