1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:04,265
Wow, what a gorgeous day!

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,954
Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early
for once and cleared all the clouds away.

3
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:11,756
I bet all of Ponyville is gonna be out,
enjoying the sunshine.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,137
What? Where is everypony?

5
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:23,536
Is it some sort of pony holiday?

6
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:24,981
Not that I know of.

7
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:27,010
Does my breath stink?

8
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,685
Not more than usual.

9
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:31,761
Is it...

10
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:33,061
...zombies?!

11
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:34,943
Uh... not very likely.

12
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:37,809
Not likely but possible?

13
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:39,087
Psst!

14
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:42,511
Twilight!

15
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:44,670
Spike!

16
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:45,833
Come 'ere!

17
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,073
Come here!

18
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:49,784
Hurry!

19
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,552
Before she gets you!

20
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,617
Who?! The zombie pony?

21
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:58,980
Zzzombie pony?!

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,704
Spike, there are no zombie ponies.

23
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:05,636
Pinkie, what are you doing
here alone in the dark?

24
00:01:05,637 --> 00:01:07,201
I'm not alone in the dark.

25
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,241
Okay then, what are you all
doing here in the dark?

26
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:13,552
We're h-hidin' from her!

27
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,973
Did you see her, Twilight?

28
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:06,783
Did you see Zecora?

29
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:09,285
Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.

30
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,676
Well, I saw here glance this way...

31
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:14,449
Glance eeevilly this way!

32
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:17,261
...and then a bunch of you
flip out for no good reason.

33
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,051
No good reason?!

34
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,582
You call protectin' your kin no good reason?

35
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:24,941
Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town...

36
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:27,554
...she started shakin' in her lil' horse shoes.

37
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,242
Diiid nooot.

38
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:31,155
So I swept her up and brought her here.

39
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:33,305
I walked here myself!

40
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:34,593
For safekeepin'.

41
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,780
Applejack! I'm not a baby!

42
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,605
I can take care of myself.

43
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,923
Not from that creepy Zecora.

44
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:43,045
She's mysterious...

45
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,263
Sinister...

46
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,988
And spoooky!

47
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:57,401
Will you cut that out?

48
00:02:57,809 --> 00:03:00,621
Just look at those stripes. So garish.

49
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,420
She's a zebra.

50
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,079
A WHAT?!

51
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:07,850
A zebra. And her stripes aren't
a fashion choice, Rarity.

52
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:09,669
They're what she was born with.

53
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:15,250
Born where? I've never seen
a pony like that in these parts.

54
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,838
'cept her.

55
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:18,998
Well, she's probably not from here.

56
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,227
And she's not a pony.

57
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:23,270
My books say that zebras come from a faraway land.

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,270
But I've never seen her in Ponyville.

59
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:26,715
Where does she live?

60
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,697
That's just it.

61
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:29,965
She lives in...

62
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:32,354
...the Everfree Forest!

63
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,830
Spike!

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,789
Uh... sorry.

65
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,721
The Everfree Forest just ain't natural.

66
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:41,315
The plants grow...

67
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,635
Animals care for themselves...

68
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,498
And the clouds move...

69
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,847
...ALL ON THEIR OWN!

70
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,657
And that wicked enchantress Zecora
lives there, doing her evil...

71
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:53,588
...stuff!

72
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,965
Oh, she's so evil I even wrote a song about her!

73
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,333
Here we go...

74
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:00,162
<i>She's an evil enchantress!
She does evil dances!</i>

75
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:03,114
<i>And if you look deep in her eyes
She puts you in trances!</i>

76
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:05,613
<i>Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew!</i>

77
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,170
<i>Then she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew!</i>

78
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:09,763
<i>So... WATCH OUT!</i>

79
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,999
Wow. Catchy.

80
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:15,622
It's a work in progress.

81
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:18,145
This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors.

82
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:21,756
Now tell me, what exactly have you
actually seen Zecora do?

83
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:23,337
Well...

84
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:27,569
Once a month she comes into Ponyville...

85
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:28,648
Ooh!

86
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:31,618
Then she lurks by the stores...

87
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,216
Oh my!

88
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:36,595
And then she digs at the ground...

89
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:38,670
Good gracious!

90
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,224
Okay, I'm sorry.

91
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,067
But how is any of this bad?

92
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:44,274
Maybe she comes to town to visit?

93
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:47,117
Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly?

94
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:51,091
And maybe she's not lurking by the stores,
maybe she's going to them...

95
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,327
...lurk-free, to so some shopping.

96
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,786
Yeah! Everypony likes to shop.

97
00:04:55,787 --> 00:04:56,750
You know what I think...?

98
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:59,373
Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk!

99
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:01,432
I am a big pony!

100
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:04,054
W-what about digging at the ground?

101
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,467
You gotta admit that's weird.

102
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:09,788
What if she's digging for innocent creatures?

103
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,960
I am sure there's an explanation
for everything Zecora does.

104
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,595
And if anypony here were actually
brave enough to approach her...

105
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:18,255
...she would find out the truth.

106
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:21,909
Well, I'm brave enough.
I'm gonna find out myself.

107
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,289
You ponies are being ridiculous!

108
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:47,571
Well, I heard that Zecora...

109
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,094
...EATS HAY!

110
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,855
Pinkie, I eat hay!

111
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,247
You eat hay!

112
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:56,019
Yeah, but I heard it's
the eeevil way she eats hay.

113
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,241
Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?

114
00:05:58,242 --> 00:05:59,688
The door's open!

115
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:01,767
She went outside!

116
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,039
And Zecora is still out there!

117
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,633
That silly lil' filly...
I told her to stay put!

118
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:10,929
Spike, you stay here in case
Apple Bloom comes back.

119
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,076
Will do!

120
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,748
Apple Bloom!

121
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:41,940
You get back here right now!

122
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:44,988
Beware! Beware, you ponyfolk!

123
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:47,390
Those leaves of blue are not a joke!

124
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,785
You... You keep your crazy mumbo-jumbo
to yourself, ya hear?

125
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:58,374
Oh, brother.

126
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:01,845
Beware! Beware!

127
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:04,714
Yeah! Back at you, Zecora!

128
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,812
You and your lame curse
are the ones who better beware.

129
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:09,322
And you.

130
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:11,525
Why couldn't you just listen to your big sister?

131
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:12,945
I... I...

132
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:16,077
Who knows what kind of nasty curse
Zecora could have just put on you?

133
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:17,681
Just like in my song!

134
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:20,258
<i>Evil enchantress! With the dances!</i>

135
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:21,639
<i>And the trances!</i>

136
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,164
You guys, there's no such thing as curses!

137
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:28,705
Well, that's interesting to hear
coming from from Miss Magic Pants herself.

138
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:31,959
My magic, real magic comes from within.

139
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,567
It's the skill you're born with.

140
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:36,026
Curses are artificial. Fake magic.

141
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:38,592
It's cantrip with potions and incantations.

142
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:40,311
All smoke and mirrors meant to scare.

143
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:42,338
But curses have no real power.

144
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,996
They're just an old pony tale.

145
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,395
Just you wait, Twilight.

146
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:48,971
You're gonna learn that some pony tales...

147
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:50,917
...really are true.

148
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:59,719
<i>She's an evil enchantress!
She does evil dances!</i>

149
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,763
BEWAAARE! BEWAAARE!

150
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,501
<i>If you look deep in her eyes
She will put you in trances!</i>

151
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,637
Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!

152
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:11,856
-Wicked, wicked zebra!
-A curse.

153
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,344
<i>Then what will she do?</i>

154
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:15,305
Just you wait, Twilight.

155
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:17,892
Some pony tales really are true.

156
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:20,705
<i>Then she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew!</i>

157
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,071
Sooo... WATCH OUT!

158
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,471
Ugh... What a dream.

159
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,268
Curses-shmurses.

160
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:36,982
Whoa.

161
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:39,502
Maybe Zecora cursed my hair?

162
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,304
Or she cursed my horn!

163
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,802
No, no, no, no, no!

164
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,089
None of these books have a cure!

165
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,435
There has to be a real reason for this.

166
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,602
An illness? An allergy?

167
00:08:58,986 --> 00:08:59,835
A curse!

168
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:01,638
I said a real reason.

169
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:04,026
Something that points to something real.

170
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:05,402
How about this one?

171
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:07,737
"Supernaturals"?

172
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:12,606
Spike, the word "supernatural" refers to
things like ghosts and spirits and zombies.

173
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:14,744
Which are as make believe as curses.

174
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,687
This book is just a bunch of hooey.

175
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:19,750
But what if you're wrong, Twilight?

176
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:20,921
What if this really is a...

177
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,785
"A purse"? How could it be a purse?

178
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:27,331
Pinkie! What happened?

179
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,656
Hey! Say it, don't spray it, Pinkie.

180
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:39,105
She's... trying to say... ow...

181
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:40,617
...Zecora... ow...

182
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,094
...she zapped us all with a... ow!

183
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,396
...curse!

184
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:46,023
I'm afraid I have to agree.

185
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:51,187
I hate to say I told you so, Twilight...

186
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:52,773
...but I told you so!

187
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:55,757
It's a curse, I tells you!

188
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:58,977
But Fluttershy seems just fine.

189
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:02,218
Yes. There doesn't seem to be
a thing wrong with her.

190
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,297
Fluttershy? Are you okay?

191
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,282
Is there something wrong with you?

192
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,089
Would you care to tell us?

193
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,899
So... you're not gonna tell us.

194
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:18,456
Yes, you're not or yes, you will?

195
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:21,676
Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?

196
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,100
I don't wanna talk about it.

197
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:29,237
This is hilarious!

198
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,390
Look at all of you. We got...

199
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:32,471
Hairity...

200
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:33,895
Rainbow Crash...

201
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:35,266
Spitty Pie...

202
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,535
Appletini...

203
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:37,417
Flutterguy...

204
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:38,105
And...

205
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,049
I got nuthin'.

206
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,902
Twilight Sparkle. I mean, seriously,
I can't even work with that.

207
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,318
This is no joke, Spike.

208
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,925
Now start looking for more
books so I can find a cure.

209
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,646
I think we'll find a cure
for this curse at Zecora's place.

210
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,822
It's not a curse!

211
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:03,913
I agree with Dash.

212
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,491
We'll go to Zecora's and force her
to remove this hex.

213
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:09,437
It's not a hex either!

214
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:15,409
This is all my fault.

215
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,431
If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place,
none of this would have happened.

216
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:21,516
I just gotta fix this.

217
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:25,420
Now where does she think she's goin' this time?

218
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,333
I don't care what you say, Twilight.

219
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:33,135
It's time to pony up and confront Zecora.

220
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:35,408
Come on, girls! Are you with me?

221
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,747
And I as well.

222
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:42,006
Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.

223
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:45,574
How about you, Applejack?

224
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,296
Applejack?

225
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,037
[She's gone!]

226
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:51,181
Has somepony stepped on her?!

227
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:55,260
Or sat on her?

228
00:11:58,499 --> 00:11:59,632
Rarity's hair!

229
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:02,505
Oh! Oh! Pinkie, what are you doing?

230
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:06,011
Really... Ah! Ever heard of personal space?

231
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,255
[Nope!]

232
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:09,135
Apple Bloom is gone too!

233
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:11,422
I bet they went after Zecora.

234
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,947
Well, we better go find them.

235
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:15,493
Come on, girls. Let's go!

236
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,675
Ooh! Oh dear, ugh...

237
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:19,987
Oh, this is so unseemly...

238
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,698
Hey! A little help here?

239
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,988
Oopsie. Sorry.

240
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:28,466
Ow!

241
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:32,157
Uh... Spike?

242
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:33,891
Are you coming?

243
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:34,650
Nope!

244
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:38,406
Gotta stay here and look for the cure.

245
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:40,956
Twilight Flopple!

246
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,323
Stop it right there!

247
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,379
Turn around right now, missy!

248
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:53,507
No.

249
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:57,609
No?! You can't ignore direct order
from your big sister!

250
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:04,873
Sorry, Applejack. But *I'm* the big sister now.

251
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:08,450
Apple Bloom! You come back here
right this instant!

252
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:11,270
I'm gonna tell Big Macintosh on you!

253
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:14,974
Oh, pony feathers.

254
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:19,190
Come on, girls. We've got to get to Zecora's.

255
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:20,055
Hurry!

256
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,269
Easier said than done.

257
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:27,296
Heeey! Wait for me!

258
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:37,920
Rainbow! Thank Celestia.

259
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,327
There's no time to lose!

260
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,559
I need to get to Zecora's pronto.

261
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,862
Get it up, pony!

262
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:48,947
Excuse me!?

263
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:51,166
YEEHAW!

264
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:52,730
What the...

265
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:55,831
No, Rainbow Dash! Other way!

266
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:04,691
I look horrible!

267
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,147
[No. This looks horrible.]

268
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:10,586
Oh my. That place really does look horrible.

269
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:16,395
Nice decorations. If you like creepy!

270
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,597
"She stole your song?"

271
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:38,588
Oh, Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.

272
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:51,699
<i>She's an evil enchantress
And she does evil dances</i>

273
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,163
<i>And if you look deep in her eyes
She will put you in trances</i>

274
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:59,209
<i>Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew</i>

275
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,178
<i>And she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew</i>

276
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:06,590
<i>So... watch out.</i>

277
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:08,798
You saw those terrible things.

278
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,777
Now you believe us, Twilight?

279
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:16,690
Scary looking masks, confusing incantations
and a great, big, bubbling cauldron?

280
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:20,548
Oh. Everything is pointing to Zecora being...

281
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:21,867
...bad.

282
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:23,419
Or...

283
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:25,738
What if Zecora is just making soup?

284
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,451
The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume.

285
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:35,574
Now, where is that little Apple Bloom?

286
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,026
Or...

287
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:39,554
What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?

288
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:44,361
What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?

289
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:51,208
I'm coming for ya, Apple Bloom!

290
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:56,491
Ho there!

291
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,961
Heel, Rainbow Crash!

292
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:05,635
What have you done with Apple Bloom?!

293
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,366
No! No!

294
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,258
Ponies! What is this...

295
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,663
No! You know not what you do!

296
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:30,171
You've gone and spilled my precious brew.

297
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,192
We're on to you, Zecora.

298
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:34,147
I didn't wanna believe that you cursed us...

299
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:36,150
...but the evidence is overwhelming.

300
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,276
You made me look ridiculous!

301
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:40,588
You made me sound ridiculous!

302
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,221
You ruined my horn!

303
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:46,942
How dare you!?

304
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:49,956
You destroy my home, destroy my work...

305
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,784
...then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?

306
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,497
You put this curse on us,
now you're gonna uncurse us!

307
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:59,189
It is unwise to venture down this road.

308
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:02,483
Your actions will make my anger explode!

309
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,917
Where is Apple Bloom?!

310
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:09,220
Zecora! I think I found
all the things you asked for.

311
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:12,663
What in Ponyville is going on here?

312
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:16,299
Apple Bloom! You're okay!

313
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,344
Why wouldn't I be?

314
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:21,645
Because Zecora is an evil enchantress, who
cursed us and was gonna cook you up in a soup!

315
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:25,386
Oh, Twilight.

316
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:28,394
Did those silly fillies finally get in your head?

317
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:30,685
You know there's no such thing as a curse.

318
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:35,029
Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just
stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.

319
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:37,365
This isn't a curse.

320
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:41,991
If you will remember back,
the words I spoke were quite exact.

321
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:45,614
Beware. Beware, you ponyfolk.

322
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:48,049
Those leaves of blue are not a joke.

323
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:52,537
It was a warnin'. About that blue plant.

324
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,134
It's called poison joke.

325
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,098
That plant is much like poison oak.

326
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:59,724
But its results are like a joke.

327
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:02,453
What in the hay does that mean?

328
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:05,360
It means this plant does not breed wrath.

329
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:08,316
Instead this plant just wants a laugh.

330
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:11,850
Will somepony please talk normal?

331
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:16,020
I think what she's saying is that
when we ran in to save Apple Bloom...

332
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,022
...we ran into the poison joke.

333
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:21,264
All our problems are just little jokes it played on us!

334
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:23,149
LITTLE JOKES?!

335
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:24,290
Very funny.

336
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:25,584
Okay, fine.

337
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:27,652
But... what about the cauldron?

338
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:28,986
And the chanting.

339
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:30,580
And a creepy decor.

340
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,139
Treasures of the native land where I am from.

341
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:38,439
This one speaks "hello" and this "welcome".

342
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:41,299
Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.

343
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:44,035
The words I chanted were from olden times.

344
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:46,682
Something you call a nursery rhyme.

345
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,528
But... the cauldron... the Apple Bloom soup...

346
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:54,034
Lookie here, Twilight.
That pot o' water wasn't for me.

347
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:56,049
It was for all these herbal ingredients.

348
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:59,563
The cure for poison joke is
a simple all-natural remedy.

349
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,467
You just gotta take a bubble bath.

350
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:06,162
But I tried to find a cure in all my books
and couldn't find anything.

351
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:08,608
What book has this "natural remedy"?

352
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,835
Here is the book, you see?

353
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:13,969
Sad that you lack it in your library.

354
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:17,183
Actually, I do have this book.

355
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,215
But I didn't look inside,
because the title was so...

356
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:21,529
...weird.

357
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:26,566
"Supernaturals: natural remedies
and cure-alls that are simply... super."

358
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:28,859
I... I...

359
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,577
I'm so sorry, Zecora.

360
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:34,975
I had the answer the whole time
if only I bothered to look inside.

361
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:39,325
Maybe next time you will take a second look.

362
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:41,698
And not judge the cover of the book.

363
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,422
Zecora, would you be kind enough to mix up
another batch of the herbal bath?

364
00:19:47,783 --> 00:19:49,827
Mix it up I certainly will.

365
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:53,155
Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville.

366
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:58,077
But whenever Zecora comes to town,
all the shops are mysteriously closed.

367
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:01,747
Oh, well... I think we can help you with that.

368
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:07,503
Look, Rose! How awful!

369
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,984
The wicked enchantress has cursed them all!

370
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:12,949
The horror! The horror!

371
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,839
Daisy, we need to talk.

372
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:28,246
"Dear Princess Celestia."

373
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:31,517
"My friends and I all learned
an important lesson this week:"

374
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:33,511
"Never judge a book by its cover."

375
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,966
"Someone may look unusual or funny or scary..."

376
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:40,173
"...but you have to look past that
and learn who they are inside."

377
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,763
"Real friends don't care what your cover is."

378
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:45,140
"It's the contents of the pony that count."

379
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:49,264
"And a good friend, like a good book,
is something that will last forever."

380
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:51,994
"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

381
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,032
Miss Zecora, I would love to
get the recipe for this bath.

382
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,990
It's simply luxurious.

383
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:02,112
Applejack! Hey, where is Applejack?!

384
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:06,967
I'm right here, lil' sis.

385
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,711
I ain't tiny no more.

386
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:14,171
Oh, I have never felt so lovely
in all of my life!

387
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:17,348
Oh my gosh! I never realized
how horrible is not to be able to talk!

388
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:21,157
I mean I love talking so much and I couldn't
talk at all when my tongue was all EEEH!

389
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:23,514
It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?

390
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:26,074
Yes.

391
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:33,911
