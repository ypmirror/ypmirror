353
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,864
Who else would've gone
all across Equestria

354
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,502
to plan one party?

355
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:08,255
You know, the trip
was really hard,

356
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:11,367
but everypony I met along
the way was so helpful.

357
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:14,518
I just wish the yaks could see
how friendly and wonderful

358
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,548
and great Equestria really is.

359
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,834
[huge gasp]

360
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:23,474
I JUST GOT THE BEST
PARTY IDEA EVER!

361
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,880
It's too late. The yaks
left on the last train.

362
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,066
Um, no they didn't.

363
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:33,424
Trust me, there are a whole
lot of sheep out there.

364
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:41,112
So, do we walk back
up the slide, or what?

365
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,994
YAKS STUCK HERE? WHY
TRAINS NOT WORK? GRRRR!

366
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:51,596
I never thought I'd say
this, but THANK YOU, SHEEP!

367
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,620
And now, if it's OK with
you, it's party time.

368
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:03,634
♪♪

369
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:04,891
[laughter]

370
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:10,361
Wow, Pinkie, this came
together quick, even for you.

371
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:13,074
What can I say? I'm
good at what I do.

372
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,596
Prince Rutherford,
every time we tried

373
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:18,403
to make something in Equestria
feel like Yakyakistan,.

374
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,782
we couldn't get it right.

375
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,982
When I got back from my
adventure, I realized something.

376
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:25,920
We shouldn't try to make
Equestria feel like your home.

377
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:29,398
We should try to make you
feel at home in Equestria.

378
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:32,822
And that means showing
you why we love it here,

379
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,693
so you'll love it too.

380
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:44,826
Pink pony work hard to make yaks
feel at home. Now yaks happy.

381
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:46,986
No declare war.

382
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:48,613
[relieved sigh]

383
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:54,300
Ponies and yaks. Friends?

384
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,060
For a thousand moons?

385
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,308
For a thousand MOONS!

386
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,472
[cheers]

387
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,662
I am very impressed, Princess.

388
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:08,407
Ha hah. Just doing my
best to spread friendship.

389
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:14,171
And you did a wonderful job
of it. You and your friends.

390
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:17,904
Pink Pony? You
understand yaks now.

391
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,586
Aw, come here, you.

392
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,542
Wow, too strong. OK! OK! OK!
