1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,489
C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,679
There's nothing fun about dragons!

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,639
Scary, yes.
Fun, no!

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,989
Fluttershy, the great dragon migration
happens only once in a generation.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,485
Do you really wanna pass up
a chance like that?

6
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,489
Now that you put it that way,

7
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:22,689
yes!

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,099
Aw Fluttershy,
we just don't want you to miss out.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,139
Miss out on what? Dragons?

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,589
Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,139
Well... yeah!

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,259
Thanks, but... no thanks!

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,689
Look, Fluttershy, I watched that
boring butterfly migration with you,

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,839
so now it's your turn to watch
the dragon migration with me!

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,899
You owe me!

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,301
I said... no!

17
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,989
Okay, I guess
I'll let you off the hook this time.

18

21
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:42,456
I don't see any dragons.

22
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:43,607
Me neither.

23
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:45,158
Me neither neither.

24
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:46,609
Shoot!

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,206
You don't think we missed them, do you?

26
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:50,056
No, I don't think so.

27
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:52,437
We're just a little early,
and I'm glad we are.

28
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:54,776
This way, we can watch
every moment of the migration

29
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,416
without bringing any unwanted
attention to ourselves!

30
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:58,967
Yoo-hoo!

31
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:00,518
Well?

32
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:04,876
What do you think?
Am I the toast of the trench or what?

33
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,556
You'll be toast alright!

34
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,836
When the dragons see you
parading around in that getup...

35
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:10,806
You look very nice, Rarity.

36
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:13,680
But could you maybe look nice
down here in the trench with us?

37
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:17,956
Nice is an understatement.
I look fabulous!

38
00:02:18,107 --> 00:02:20,198
Who says camouflage has to be drab?

39
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,349
Ahoy, maties!

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,238
Dragons ho!

41
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:33,401
Amazing!

42
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,216
Pretty lame move.
Is that all they've got?

43
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,998
What do ya think of that move,
Rainbow Dash?

44
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,149
Still think they're lame?

45
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,047
Uh, not so much.

46
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:50,356
The word 'fierce' comes to mind.

47
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,086
And 'formidable'.

48
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,321
And 'super-duper scary'!

49
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:55,372
Yeah.

50
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,154
Us dragons are definitely
a force to be reckoned with.

51
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,927
Yeah, right, Spike.

52
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:07,075
That's one of the scariest aprons
I've ever seen!

53
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:10,431
What's wrong with wearing an apron?

54
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:13,682
You won't be laughing when you spill
blueberries all over your scales.

55
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,878
Feathers. That's one tough stain!

56
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,596
One tough stain against one lame dragon!

57
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,207
You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash!

58
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:25,406
Spike's style is unique.

59
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:27,485
He doesn't have
to look like other dragons.

60
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:28,636
Or act like them.

61
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:32,029
My little Spikey-wikey
is perfect the way he is.

62
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,476
I don't act like other dragons?

63
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:36,450
Oh, not even close!

64
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,081
But why would you want to, Spike?

65
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:42,616
Yes, you've got something those dreadfully
fierce dragons can only dream of.

66
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:43,767
What's that?

67
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:46,432
The cutest widdle chubby cheeks!

68
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:50,436
Cute?! Dragons aren't
supposed to be cute!

69
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:51,587
Right?

70
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:54,520
Oh, sweetie, you are turning
the most delightful shade of red...

71
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:56,106
It it is most becoming.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,126
Oh, isn't he adorable
when he waddles off in anger?

73
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:07,810
Waddle?! Arrrgggh!

74
00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:12,222
What am I?

75
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:14,373
Where am I from?

76
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:16,895
Who am I supposed to be?

77
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:19,309
I don't know!

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,808
For the last time, Spike,
you were given to me as an egg.

79
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,342
I don't know who found you,
or where they found you.

80
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:29,236
Seriously? That's all you know?

81
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:30,687
I'm sorry, Spike.

82
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:34,020
That doesn't tell me anything
about who I am!

83
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:36,572
I need answers!
I feel like I'm...

84
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,707
I'm looking at a complete stranger.

85
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,306
Oh, Spike.

86
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,604
Why don't we do
some late-night research?

87
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:47,045
See what we can find out.

88
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,896
Really? You'd do that?

89
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:52,337
Of course!
I'm sure we can find something.

90
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:56,614
Nothing.

91
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,195
Nothing in this one either!

92
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,845
Nothing at all about dragons?

93
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,596
This is getting ridiculous!

94
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:07,100
I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies
know next to nothing about dragons.

95
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:10,856
Apparently they're too rare and too scary
to try to talk to us or study!

96
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:14,810
I wonder if dragons cry...

97
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,161
Aw, Spike.

98
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:18,846
It's okay, Twilight.

99
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:22,467
I'm gonna discover who I am
if it's the last thing I do!

100
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:23,618
Hey guys!

101
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,469
Good morning!

102
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,020
Ya wanna join us for breakfast?

103
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:30,037
That sounds great.
I'm famished.

104
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,574
Count me out.
I've gotta get an early start!

105
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,384
An early start?

106
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,984
Yes! I'm going on
a quest of self-discovery!

107
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:40,171
I need to learn what it means
to be a dragon!

108
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:44,611
And the only way I'm gonna do that
is to join the dragon migration!

109
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,062
What?!?

110
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,138
Spike, that's nonsense talk!

111
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,474
I know that you're a dragon,

112
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,701
but those dragons mean business!

113
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,856
They're big, and tough, and scary...

114
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:59,295
And I'm small, and meek...
and I like to wear aprons. See?

115
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,360
This is exactly why I need
to spend time with them.

116
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,478
All I'm saying is that
you could get hurt.

117
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,156
Darling, this time I really do have
to agree with Rainbow Dash.

118
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:10,827
I don't want those big, ugly,
nasty dragons to hurt one little scale

119
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,886
on your cutsey-wutsey head!

120
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:15,358
I'm sorry,
but I've made up my mind.

121
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,923
Quick, do something!
Stop him before it's too late!

122
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:23,188
Hey!
Give it back!

123
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:25,139
Hold it!

124
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:31,963
Really?

125
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:33,816
Don't tell me you think he should go!

126
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:37,180
Yes, Spike. I couldn't
answer your questions.

127
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,831
My books couldn't either.

128
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,410
I understand why you want
to look elsewhere.

129
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:44,311
I truly believe you need
to go on this quest.

130
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:46,706
And we have no right to stop you.

131
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,659
I suppose not.

132
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,309
I still say you're nutty, but hey,
I've done lots of nutty things.

133
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,506
We know.

134
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:59,093
Well then,
I guess this is goodbye, Spike.

135
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:02,356
We can't wait to hear about it,
when you return.

136
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,099
Yeah, we hope your trip-

137
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,950
Quest.

138
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:08,799
-your quest answers some of
your pesky "who am I" questions.

139
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,006
Thanks, everypony. I know it will.

140
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:14,034
Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!

141
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,878
Go get 'em, big guy!

142
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,229
We have faith in you!

143
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,428
- We're following him, right?
- Of course.

144
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:23,079
Alright,
teenage dragons!

145
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,969
Now that's more my speed. And size.

146
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:31,799
I'm telling you,
we'll never pass for a real dragon!

147
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,022
Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous.

148
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:36,873
One of my finer creations.

149
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:40,722
We'll never pass if they hear
three voices coming out of one dragon!

150
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,858
Now come on,
let's go!

151
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,037
Um, excuse me?

152
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:50,838
Um, hi.
I'm Spike.

153
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,458
You sure your name
is Spike and not Shrimp?!

154
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:02,549
No, it's Spike! I'm not,
I mean, I'm sure about that...

155
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,019
You look more like Peewee to me.

156
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,318
Hey guys, come on, seriously.

157
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:10,555
Leave him alone, or he might fly away.

158
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:13,445
That is, uh, if he had any wings!

159
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:21,581
You fly in on your mommy's back
during the migration?

160
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:22,832
Not exactly...

161
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:26,152
No, no, can't you see
baby Spike just hatched?

162
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,398
I bet he still sucks his claw at night!

163
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,579
No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!

164
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:34,190
Well if you weren't just hatched,

165
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,352
how come we haven't seen
you around before?

166
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:38,759
Well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and-

167
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,739
Ponyville? That explains it!

168
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,113
I knew there was something
vaguely pony-ish about you!

169
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:47,716
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were part pony!

170
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,878
Who, me? I'm not part pony!

171
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,567
I'm all dragon, see?

172
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:57,210
Or maybe you're a pony
in a dragon costume.

173
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,464
A pony in a dragon costume!

174
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:06,443
Ahah... yeah... hilarious...

175
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,786
I am a real dragon!

176
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:10,573
Oh yeah? Prove it.

177
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:13,399
- Well... how?
- By acting like one!

178
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,968
Who's up for a little belching contest?!

179
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,898
You think you can beat that, Peewee?

180
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,415
From the desk of Princess Celestia...

181
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,576
Dear Spike, please... Ha!

182
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:57,677
Get this, guys! Spike's penpals with
a namby-pamby pony princess!

183
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,479
How can he just throw that away?!

184
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,693
That letter could be something important!

185
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:11,351
We can't worry about that now,
Twilight, we're here to help Spike!

186
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:13,002
I know, I know!

187
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,075
There's no reason to disrespect
Princess Celestia that way!

188
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:18,564
Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed.

189
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,994
Ready... go!

190
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,821
The winner!

191
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,857
Good old tail wrestling...

192
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:42,109
We can't let little Spikey-wikey
wrestle one of them!

193
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,360
He'll get clobbered!

194
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:44,511
Let's go!

195
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:47,949
I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!

196
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,400
Who's this weirdo?

197
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:51,379
I think he's Crackle's cousin.

198
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,039
That would explain it.

199
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,239
Ready?
Go!

200
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,200
Spike's the winner!

201
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,152
Nice going, little Spike!
Maybe you are a dragon after all!

202
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,021
Yeah! Maybe I am!

203
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:25,254
Rainbow Dash, I can't believe
your silly plan actually worked.

204
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,064
Alright, who's next?

205
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,255
Getting a little cocky, huh?
I like that.

206
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:35,210
So how about you wrestle... him!

207
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:40,927
Go!

208
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:50,150
So Spike, you haven't exactly proven
yourself as a dragon yet, have you?

209
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:52,272
But... I get an A for effort?

210
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:53,551
Huh, maybe.

211
00:12:53,702 --> 00:12:56,362
Let's see how you do
in this next contest.

212
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:05,022
King of the hoard!

213
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:14,751
This is my chance.

214
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,456
Not so fast!

215
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:27,368
King of the ho-whoa!

216
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:34,092
Looks like this is another
fail for you, little Spike.

217
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:37,349
Can't wait to watch you fail
at lava cannonball too.

218
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:47,211
Whoever makes the biggest lava splash
is the ultimate dragon!

219
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,099
Geronimo!

220
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:55,349
Spike's on his own this time.

221
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,265
Cannonball!

222
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:10,399
What's wrong, Spike?

223
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,266
You afraid the lava would hurt
your soft pony hide?

224
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,899
Was I... that bad?

225
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,384
No, dude, that was awesome!

226
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:41,039
Nopony could live through
a belly flop like that!

227
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,609
You're one tough little dragon.

228
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:59,441
Spike, by belly flopping so hard,
you have proven yourself worthy.

229
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:03,578
I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon'.

230
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:06,195
And will now perform
the initiation ritual.

231
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:12,399
Now let's party dragon style!

232
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:22,120
Man, was that a great party.

233
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,909
Great, huh?
Maybe by Ponyville standards.

234
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
Stick with us, Spike.

235
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,777
We still got plenty to teach you
about being a dragon.

236
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,675
I'm not going anywhere.
The way I feel right now,

237
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:34,696
I could hang out with you guys forever.

238
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:36,547
Forever?!

239
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:46,208
Spikey-wikey is going to stay
with these awful dragons? Forever?

240
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,486
Oh no, this is terrible!

241
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:51,445
I should've stopped him back
at the library when I had the chance!

242
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:54,102
No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault!

243
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,132
I encouraged him to go!

244
00:15:56,283 --> 00:16:00,137
Y'know, Spike, I think you just might
be ready for a real dragon raid.

245
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:04,932
There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby,

246
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,832
and we're gonna swipe 'em!

247
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,656
Aren't you totally psyched
to go on this raid?

248
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,847
Oh yeah, I'm excited.

249
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:14,512
I mean, I'm psyched.

250
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:17,181
Alright then. Let's fly!

251
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,932
Sorry guys! Guess I'll meet you
back here at the crater!

252
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,057
After the whole raid thing's over?
We'll totally hang then!

253
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:32,660
Oh no, they took Spike!
We've gotta go after them!

254
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:40,688
Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!

255
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,113
And you're ruining my fabulous costume!

256
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:47,735
I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!

257
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:50,415
Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!

258
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,241
Alright, Spike,
since you're a rookie dragon,

259
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:03,182
you get to lure the parents
away from the nest.

260
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,493
Huh... lucky me...

261
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:07,300
Well go on, then!

262
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:10,432
Hey Mr and Mrs Phoenix!

263
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,723
I was hoping I could have a word with you?

264
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:18,421
I'd like to ask you
some questions actually...

265
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,338
We haven't got all day, Spike!

266
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:25,012
Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!

267
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,750
What the...

268
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:36,132
The eggs have hatched.

269
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,583
What do we do now?

270
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:41,232
We take the hatchlings, of course!

271
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:54,032
Get 'em!

272
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:20,122
Get them!

273
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:36,945
They got away! I hate that!

274
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:43,875
What have we got here?

275
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:47,743
What happened?

276
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:48,894
They got away!

277
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,804
You stole an egg?

278
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:56,182
I guess the raid wasn't
a total waste after all.

279
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,330
Nice going, Spike.

280
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:02,821
Well, what are you
waiting for, Spike?

281
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:03,972
Smash it!

282
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:06,469
- Smash the egg?
- Yeah!

283
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,312
Yeah, throw it on the ground
as hard as you can!

284
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:16,889
Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!
Smash it! Smash it!

285
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:28,206
No! It's just a defenseless egg,
like I was!

286
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:29,782
And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!

287
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,360
- What did you say?
- I said, no!

288
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,292
No one says no to me.

289
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,397
Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!

290
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:46,548
That's right!

291
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:49,383
Fighting's not really my thing,
I'm more into fashion,

292
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:53,582
but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch
one scale on his cute little head!

293
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,859
Ooh, scary!

294
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,510
Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies
your friends?

295
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,632
Yes, they are. And they're better friends
than you could ever be.

296
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,802
Now, if you don't back off,
you'll see what us ponies do

297
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:14,532
when confronted by
a huge group of jerky dragons.

298
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:18,021
Oh yeah?
What's that?

299
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,570
Run away!

300
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,662
That was a close one. Thanks you guys.

301
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:46,532
Of course. What are friends for?

302
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:51,482
You're more than friends.
You're my family.

303
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:56,049
Dear Princess Celestia,

304
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,526
seeing the great dragon migration made me
wonder what it meant to be a dragon.

305
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:05,168
But now I realize that who I am
is not the same as what I am.

306
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,092
I may have been born a dragon,
but Equestria and my pony friends

307
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:12,850
have taught me how to be kind,
loyal, and true!

308
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:17,955
I'm proud to call Ponyville my home,
and to have my pony friends as my family.

309
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,449
Yours truly, Spike.

310
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,350
Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee!

311
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:32,140
Stick with me, I've got plenty
to teach you about being a pony.
