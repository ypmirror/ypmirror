47

Well, you see,
it's the breeze

48
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,003
that activates the
Breezie's magic.

49
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:40,585
And that magic protects the
pollen they're carrying

50
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:41,806
from being destroyed.

51
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:46,731
So no breeze means no magic
means the pollen goes bad?

52
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:47,787
That's right.

53
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:50,450
And they only have two days
to get that pollen back

54
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,987

their home closes.

I had to rescue Seabreeze

I can't help you anymore!

330
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,199
In fact, I wasn't helping
you at all by being nice.

331
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:48,074
But the truth of the matter
is that I must be firm!

332
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:51,867
You must go.
