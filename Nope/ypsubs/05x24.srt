1
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,740
Wow, Applejack!

2
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,350
Are you sure you've never
managed a concert before?

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,480
Well, it turns out
doin' up a concert's

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,020
the same as settin' up a rodeo.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,160
And thanks to Pinkie's
connections organizing

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,690
the Ponypalooza Rock Concert,

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,160
we've got quite a line-up

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,840
for the Helping
Hooves Music Festival.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,900
Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow
Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike!

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,340
Pinkie Pie! Oh, wait,
that's me! EVERYPONY!

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,340
What is it, Pinkie?

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,640
I have the most
amazing news ever!

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,500
It is totally going
to freak your frizz!

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,720
Well, spill it, Pinkie!

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,680
It wasn't easy. In fact,
it was terribly difficult.

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,740
But I have managed to book
the biggest Pony Pop Star

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,160
in all of Equestria
as the main attraction

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,380
of the Helping Hooves
Music Festival!

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,960
Sapphire Shores?

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,590
Sapphire Shores? Please!

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,560
Sapphire Shores is merely the
SECOND biggest Pony Pop Star

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,220
in Equestria!

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,200
I have booked: The One. The
Only. Countess Coloratura!

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,800
OOOOOOOOOO! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,860
Who in the hay is
Countess Coloratura?

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,060
My frizz has been freaked.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:46,360

We have muffins!

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,600
Pinkie Pie, who is this
Countess Coloratura pony?

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,760
I just told you

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,040
that she's the biggest Pony
Pop Star in Equestria!

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,370
How, how, how, how, how
have you not heard of her?

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,060
Don' know. Though I did
know a gal named Coloratura

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,120
when I was just a filly.

34
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,920
Wouldn't it just be the funniest
thing if that Coloratura

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,840
and this Coloratura were
the same Coloratura?

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,440
Do you mean to tell me
that you actually know

37
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,780
Countess Coloratura?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,020
Well, I don't think
it's the same pony

39
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,020
since my friend wasn't any
sort of highfalutin' Countess.

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,580
Do you remember her Cutie Mark?

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,140
Sure do! It had this super
colorful bunch of musical notes

42
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,660
that just shimmered
in the light.

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,640
You mean, like this?

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,600
Well, fancy that! That there's
the very same Cutie Mark!

45
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,860
Do you have any idea the number
of hoops I had to jump through

46
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,520
to get her to perform at the
Festival? A whole lot of hoops!

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,280
That pony is very demanding!

48
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,580
Naw!

49
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,200
Yaaaaw!

50
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,480
I completely understand.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
We artistes require
certain necessities

52
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,520
in order to do our best work.

53
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,000
This was clearly some
sort of misunderstandin',

54
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,560
cause Rara was just
as down home as me!

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,000
Rara?

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,800
Even that big name
was too fancy for her.

57
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,340
So I shortened
ColoRAtuRA to Rara.

58
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,220
<i> We had the best time</i>
<i> at Camp Friendship.</i>

59
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,440
<i> Rara was just so easy goin'.</i>

60
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,520
<i> We were like two apples</i>
<i> from the same branch.</i>

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,220
<i> Rara and I prepared this song</i>
<i> for the Camp Talent Show.</i>

62
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,020
<i> When we performed,</i>
<i> she belted it out,</i>

63
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,520

but then we lost touch.

75
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,720
But Rara always did
want to go to Manehattan

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,770
to try and make it big.

77
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,840
But a demandin' diva?

78
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,600
Just you wait, Pinkie.

79
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,000
Once Rara gets here, you'll see
she's just a plain ol' pony

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,980
like you or me.

81
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,540
I don't have to
wait! She's here!

82
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,720
Really?

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,070
Rara?

84
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,740
AAAAAAH! COUNTESS COLORATURA!

85
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,450
Clear the way. Step back.

86
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,720
Keep your hooves and
tails to yourselves.

87
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,940
No. That can't be her.

88
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,600
Um...Hi. Remember me? We
met at Camp Friendship?

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,000
I gave you the
nickname Rara?

90
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,960
AJ?

91
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,100
Yeah! Howdy, Rara!

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
Hoovsies!

93
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,380
Ooh! You got Hoovsies from
Countess Coloratura! Look!

94
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,720
Ooh! She clearly thinks
you're very special!

95
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,240
Hoovsies! Hoovsies! Hoovsies!

96
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,320
Yeah, real special.

97
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,730
Now that's how you
make an entrance!

98
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,120
Big! Bold! Absolutely stunning!

99
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,800
Though it was muddied a
bit with your interaction

100
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,560
with that dusty farm pony.
Do you actually know her?

101
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,980
Oh, yeah. That's my
childhood filly friend, AJ!

102
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,580
She was the one that
started calling me Rara.

103
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,680
Oh, yes. How cute and common.

104
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,640
Of course, I was the one that
started calling you Countess!

105
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,690
And just look at how
you've moved up

106
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,160
in Equestria since then!

107
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,840
Why, you've gotten everything
you've ever wanted!

108
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,100
Speaking of which...

109
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,080
Where is the pony Pinkie Pie?

110
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,460
Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie
Pie, Mr. Manager, sir!

111
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,060
Do you have the water
imported from Rainbow Falls

112
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,840
that I requested for
Countess Coloratura?

113
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,510
I have twenty glass
containers full right here!

114
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,020
Did I not tell you
to provide straws

115
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,900
in all of Countess
Coloratura's beverages?

116
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,740
I don't think so.

117
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
But lucky for you,

118
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,620
I have the biggest straw
collection in Equestria!

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,300
I call this straw Fernando.

120
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,020
Hmm. Let us confirm that you
acquired the rest of the items

121
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,800
that Countess
Coloratura requested

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,220
before she performs her
run-through, shall we?

123
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,720
Oh, we shall!

124
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,520
Floral arrangements from the
Royal Canterlot Gardens.

125
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,450
Chocolate éclairs made
by Gustave le Grande.

126
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,920
A selection of crystals
from the Crystal Empire.

127
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,720
Freshly picked cherries
from Cherry Jubilee's farm

128
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,550
separated red from yellow?

129
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,740
Absotutely!

130
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,240
Well, by some miracle,

131
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,460
your requests have
been reasonably met.

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,640
So let us move
on...to rehearsal!

133
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,740
See, Applejack? Demanding!

134
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,540
Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara
I knew didn't hide behind a veil

135
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,040
givin' out fake stamp kisses,
sippin' up imported water,

136
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,040
and needin' her
cherries separated.

137
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,040
Oh, I do understand.

138
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,110
Sometimes it's hard to
see our friends change.

139
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,050
She's become a whole other pony!

140
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,620
Trust me, once you see
Countess Coloratura perform,

141
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,720
you simply won't believe it!

Oh, my shining star! Thanks
to the sparkling costumes,

169
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,100
dazzling choreography, and
brilliant vocal effects

170
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,600
that I designed,

171
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,960
your performance
was SPECTACULAR,

172
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,420
Countess Coloratura!

173
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,060
Oh, thank you, Svengallop!

174
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,380
Correct me if
I'm wrong here,

175
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,820
but that feller isn't
actually complimentin' Rara.

176
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,640
He's complimentin' all the bells
and whistles he's piled on

177
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,600
to make her Countess Coloratura.

178
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,400
Oh, no, no, no, no! You
don't understand, Applejack.

179
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,320
Creating all those
elements is a lot of work

180
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,300
and Countess
Coloratura's performance

181
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,970
wouldn't exist without them.

182
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,260
If you ask me, that wouldn't
necessarily be a bad thing.

183
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,200
Oh, if we're all done here,

184
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
I'd love to go back to my
trailer and rest, Svengallop.

185
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,220
Actually, right now
you're scheduled

186
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,200
for your Meet and Greet
with the school ponies!

187
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,600
I can totally get
you out of meeting

188
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,740
with the school
ponies, Countess.

189
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,920
Absolutely not! My
favorite part of any event

190
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,890
is meeting with
the school ponies!

191
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,700
The school ponies'll be so
happy to hear that, Rara.

192
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
Ponyville School Ponies!

193
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
As part of the Helping
Hooves Music Festival,

194
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,180
I'm holding a contest where
some of you will get a chance

195
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,880
to sing with me on stage at the
concert tomorrow! Sound fun?

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,180
All right! Now who
wants more Hoovsies?

197
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,940
Now, that's more like
the Rara I remember.

198
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,990
<i> But I got everything</i>
<i> you requested.</i>

199
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,580
That was for
Countess Coloratura.

200
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,400
This is for me. And what
I want is premium oats.

201
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,340
Oh, well, we have lots of tasty
oats right here in Ponyville.

202
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,240
I would not feed
those to a chicken!

203
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,020
I want top-of-the-line,
Appaloosan Oats.

204
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,560
Next. It appears that we are
surrounded by apple trees.

205
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,660
Bring me 500 pre-peeled,
pre-cored apples.

206
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,200
And I want those
things in 24 hours!

207
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,820
But that's impossible!

208
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,700
Do you want me to pull
Countess Coloratura

209
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,400
from your little podunk
charity show? Because I will.

210
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,600
Applejack! Svengallop just
made all of these new demands

211
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,000
I heard, Pinkie.
But don't you fret.

212
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,480
I'll talk to Rara and
fix things right up.

213
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,180
Did you see, sis? Did you see?

214
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,110
Is this the little sister
you wrote to me about, AJ?

215
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,190
Hold on, Applejack! You wrote to
Countess Coloratura...about me?

216
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,120
AJ said you were the best little
sister ever, Apple Bloom.

217
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,430
All right now, you best
git along, little ponies.

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,660
Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk
to you about your manager?

219
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,110
Sure, what about him?

220
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,180
Well, while you were meetin'
with the school ponies,

221
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,350
he was demandin' all sorts
of stuff from Pinkie Pie.

222
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,240
Svengallop works very
hard as my manager, AJ.

223
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,240
So if he needs some things
when we're on the road,

224
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,040
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

225
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,640
Well, do you see something
wrong with him telling Pinkie

226
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,990
that if she doesn't get
those things by tomorrow,

227
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,190
he'd pull you from
our charity festival?

228
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,600
What? But...he knows how
important charity is to me

229
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,300
and leaving the festival would
completely ruin my image!

230
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't
give a pickled Pippin

231
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,340
about your charity work.

232
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,760
That's not true!

233
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,380
Svengallop has always supported
me in all my interests.

234
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,410
You're just saying those
things because you're jealous.

235
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,300
Jealous of what? A pony who
hides behind a veil so thick

236
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,250
she can't see when
somepony's using her?

237
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,050
No, I'm not jealous
of that, Rara.

238
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,660
I am not Rara! I am
Countess Coloratura!

239
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,290
And while we may have been
friends when we were young,

240
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,860
we have clearly gone in
different directions!

241
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,910
It just ain't right!

242
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,010
He's manipulatin' her and
she's just not seein' it.

243
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,160
Enough stewing! More peeling!

244
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,100
Sorry, Pinkie, but
there is no way

245
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,040
I'm lettin' that
lousy Svengallop

246
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,620
use my friend like that!

247
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,500
Ohhhh.

248
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,260
Countess Coloratura!

249
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,240
Wow, AJ! You said my real name.

250
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,480
I said your new name, but I
saw the real you hangin' out

251
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,970
with those school
ponies yesterday.

252
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,060
And I know somepony
that'd prefer

253
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,200
if you stopped doin'
those little events.

254
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,280
Oh, not this again.

255
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,920
C'mon, now. You just
gotta give me a chance

256
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,210
to prove what I'm
sayin' is true!

257
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,640
And just how are you
going to do that?

258
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,960
Do exactly what I say; we'll
see if that Svengallop

259
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,420
truly has your best
interests at heart.

260
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,020
Svengallop? Svengallop?

261
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,520
Where are you, Svengallop?

262
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
Here I am. Did you
need something?

263
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,260
Yes, I was...considering...

264
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,100
maybe canceling the contest
with the school ponies?

265
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,880
Countess, this is
wonderful!

266
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,980
I've been waiting
forever for you to cancel

267
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,780
that pointless
school pony contest!

268
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,010
You...have?

269
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,540
You do it at every charity event
and it does absolutely nothing

270
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,640
to promote the Countess
Coloratura image that I built!

271
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,260
Consider it CANCELED!

272
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,800
Pinkie Pie!

273
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,220
Yes, Svengallop, sir?

274
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,280
We're making some adjustments
to the show. Follow me!

275
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,060
Cancel the contest
for the fillies

276
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,260
and schedule
me a spa treatment.

277
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,620
Now that I don't have to oversee
a rehearsal with those brats,

278
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,380
I have time for the works.

279
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,820
You know the drill:

280
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,720
deliver, or the diva
ditches your dippy charity.

281
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,900
OK, Countess Coloratura!
All taken care of!

282
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,380
<i> recording plays through PA:</i>
<i> You know the drill:</i>

283
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,060
<i> deliver, or the diva</i>
<i> ditches your dippy charity.</i>

284
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,820
So that's how you've
been managing things?

285
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,740
Yeah, so? What's the problem?

286
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,120
The problem is that
you've been using my name

287
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,300
to intimidate ponies
to get what you want.

288
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,700
But I work incredibly hard for
you! I deserve everything I get!

289
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,960
But not because you scare ponies
into thinking I won't perform

290
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,380
for their charities otherwise!

291
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,840
I would never do
that to my fans.

292
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,700
Which is why you should have
known that I would never

293
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,760
cancel the School
Ponies Contest!

294
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,640
Hmm. All this charity and
school pony contest nonsense

295
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,920
is just remnants of that
boring little Rara

296
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
I met back in Manehattan.

297
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,540
You clearly don't
understand the real me.

298
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,620
That's a joke! I
made you somepony.

299
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,260
What can you even do without me?

300
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,420
Good luck, Countess
Coloratura! Good luck!

301
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,160
Oh, Rara! I'm so sorry.

302
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,730
Are you gonna be OK for
the concert tonight?

303
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,080
Of course. After all,
the show must go on!

304
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,340
Oh, my gosh, Rarity!
Svengallop's right!

305
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,820
This is going to be a disaster!
I'm gonna be terrible!

306
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,480
Can you give us
a minute, Rarity?

307
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,570
Certainly.

308
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,510
Now, why's it gonna
be so terrible?

309
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,860
Because Svengallop was
in charge of everything!

310
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,000
The lights! The
visuals! The sound!

311
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,400
Without Svengallop,
I have nothing!

312
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,480
Now, now. don't go
gettin' yourself

313
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,940
into a tizzy there, Rara.

314
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,260
Svengallop turned you
into Countess Coloratura

315
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,720
and acted like your friend
so he could enjoy the perks

316
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,860
that came with bein' a star.

317
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,700
But the real perk of friendship
is gettin' to see your friend

318
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,400
bein' true to theirself.

319
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,070
And, Rara, when
you're simply yourself,

320
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,380
you're the brightest star
I've ever seen shine!

321
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,040
Good evening, everypony!

322
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,440
Welcome to opening night of The
Helping Hooves Music Festival!

323
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,100
Now it is my great honor
to introduce you to

324
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,340
our headlining act,
Countess Coloratura!

325
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,780
This song may be familiar, but
yet it's totally different.

326
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
Kind of like me: Rara.

Thank you, everypony!

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,620
When I arrived at the Helping
Hooves Music Festival,

358
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,340
I had forgotten
who I really was.

359
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,020
But then an old friend reminded
me what real friendship is about

360
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,430
and she told me that if
I was true to myself,

361
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,400
I couldn't go wrong.

362
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,840
So, I have a very special
surprise for her.

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,980
