1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,040
Five hundred and sixty-six,

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,080
five hundred and sixty-seven...

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,560
five hundred and sixty-eight!

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,140
Phew!

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,640
Look at that, Pound Cake.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,300
I am so close to breaking my
personal cupcake icing record!

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,490
My goodness! I can't believe
what I'm seeing here!

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,740
Pretty impressive,
if I do say so myself.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,420
Pinkie, would you mind
watching the counter

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,700
while I pop to the supply room?

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,360
We've just received
a very special order

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,660
and the ingredients
need to be perfect.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,680
Okie-dokie-lokie.

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,400
Thanks, dear!

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,300
A baby?

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,020
Shining Armor and Princess
Cadance are having A BABY?

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,840
This is the best news ever! I
can't wait to tell Twilight!

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh, and Pinkie? Uh, it's
a Top Secret surprise!

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,460
Shhhhhhhh!

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
A Top Secret Surprise?

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,980
But that means I have to keep
the exciting news...

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,640
... to myself!

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:36,000

We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,000
Even though I
didn't technically

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,500
make a Pinkie Promise
to Mrs. Cake,

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,400
I can't tell Twilight
or anypony the big news.

27
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,660
That would make me a... a...
big ole' surprise ruiner!

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,580
Right, Gummy?

29
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,190
Did you take that
from Pound Cake again?

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't you know it's wrong
to steal from a baby?

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,500
What's all this
about a baby?

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
What? Who? What? Who said
something about a baby?

33
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,400
You did, Miss Pie. Just now.
What were you talking about?

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,920
Great, everypony's here!

35
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,360
Now I don't have
to wait any longer

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,720
to tell you all
the wonderful news.

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,720
Somepony special is
coming to visit Ponyville!

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,740
And I need your help
getting everything ready.

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,180
It's...

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,900
Shining Armor and
Princess Cadance!

41
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,420
Yes, and they're coming--

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,840
Tomorrow!

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,140
Yes, on the--

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,020
Friendship Express rather
than the Crystal Empire train

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,160
so as not to cause
too much of a scene

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,240
when they skip
town to come visit?

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Yes.

48
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,520
Aaaaaand?

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,660
And that's it.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,130
Oh.

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,740
Uh, how did you
know all that?

52
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,060
Hehe, heh, uh... Pinkie sense?

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,380
So, you said you needed
our help with something?

54
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,260
Follow me.

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,540
Sweet posters! Is
that Smash Fortune?

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,880
It sure is.

57
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,180
When Shining Armor said he
wanted to come to the castle

58
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,180
and visit, I started
collecting things he liked

59
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,800
when he was a colt
as a surprise.

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,840
Surprise?

61
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,360
I've been so excited that it's
been hard to keep it to myself.

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,680
I have no idea what that's like.

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,620
Aww, look at the
cute little ant farm.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,380
And check out all
these old comic books!

65
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,360
Be careful; they're
mint in bag.

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,120
What's this?

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,220
This is Brutus Force!

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,630
Shining Armor used to carry
him around like his baby.

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, ha ha, really cute.

70
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,700
It is a bit juvenile
for castle decor,

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,460
but it is very sweet of you.

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm sure Shining
Armor will love it.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,180
Me too. But, there's a few
more things I'd like to add

74
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,960
before he gets here

75
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,920
and I could really use
a hoof collecting them.

76
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,320
Whatever you need, sugar
cube, we'll help Yeah get it.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,420
Thanks, everypony.

78
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,120
I just can't wait till they
walk in and see everything!

79
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,800
Totally understandable. Watching
somepony else be surprised

80
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,180
with something is almost
better than being the one

81
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,580
who's getting the surprise!

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,120
But what if the surprise is
something so incredibly exciting

83
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
that a pony can't
keep it in any longer

84
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,680
and she has to tell the pony
who's standing next to her

85
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,480
what it is or she might explode?

86
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,500
I would say... no.

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,880
The pony who ruins a
surprise for somepony else

88
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,160
has to live with that
guilt... FOREVER!

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,380
Gotta bounce!

90
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,900
So, I know the bar
is set pretty high...

91
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,280
but does anypony
else think Pinkie Pie

92
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,120
was acting weirder than usual?

93
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,660
Phew! That was
close! Too close.

94
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,020
I almost spilled the beans.

95
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,420
Beans that would be
really hard to clean up.

96
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,220
I obviously can't be around
my friends right now...

97
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,100
or anypony for that matter.

98
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,380
Hmm. That's it! If
Shining Armor and Cadance

99
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,760
are coming tomorrow, then all
I have to do is lock myself

100
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,960
in my room away from
everypony until they arrive.

101
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,820
Then I won't ruin anything!

102
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,780
Oh, good. You're back.

103
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,540
Mrs. Cake needs my help but
these deliveries can't wait.

104
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,920
I can't thank you enough

105
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,680
for agreeing to be my backup
delivery pony, Pinkie!

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,560
I did?

107
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,580
Maybe I should hire somepony
to be my backup delivery pony.

108
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,640
I'll do it!

109
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,340
Really?

110
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,680
Sure! There's no possible way
that I could ever have anything

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,220
that might interfere
with doing that task-

112
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,920
like a gigantic,
emotionally-exhausting surprise

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,320
that would make it super hard
to be around other ponies.

114
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,700
Great! You're sure you
won't change your mind?

115
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,140
No way. Cross my heart, hope to
fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!

116
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,720
Oh, yeah. I
Pinkie-promised I'd do it.

117
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,020
And I never break a
Pinkie Promise. Never!

118
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,780
Well? Thanks again.
You're a real cake saver!

119
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,100
Maybe it'll be a quiet day and
I can just avoid everypony.

120
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,980
Hi, Pinkie Pie!

121
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,260
Heard any good
gossip today?

122
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,120
Yeah. We're bored.

123
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
Please say you have
some interesting news!

124
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,820
Nope!

125
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,700
Oof!

126
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,100
Fluttershy! What a surprise!

127
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,200
I mean, not a surprise.

128
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,920
You were in such a rush earlier!

129
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,700
Twilight wanted me to ask you
if you would bring some snacks

130
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,280
to the castle for Shining
Armor and Cadance's visit.

131
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,320
Definitely. Got it! Pinkie
Promise. Yeah. Uh huh.

132
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,860
You know, maybe
some baby carrots...

133
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,640
Ha ha ha! What did you say?

134
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,620
Baby carrots! They're
Shining Armor's favorite.

135
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,300
Mine too! Baby carrots are
like big carrots but smaller,

136
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,580
kinda like how foals are tiny
versions of their parents

137
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,540
but smaller and cuter and...

138
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,200
Albino squirrel!

139
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,740
Where? Is it Albert?

140
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,900
It's time to kick this
operation into hyper hoof.

141
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,560
And avoid all ponies
by any means necessary.

142
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,760
It didn't feel good ignoring
my friends like that.

143
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,520
Maybe I can tell just one
little pony the surprise?

144
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
The pony who ruins a
surprise for somepony else

145
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,380
has to live with that
guilt... FOREVER!

146
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,140
You're right, spooky
reflection of Rarity

147
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,060
that I know is actually
my own imagination!

148
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,960
I can't tell anypony at all.

149
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,000
Then they
would tell Twilight

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,460
and she wouldn't be surprised!
And it would be all my fault!

151
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,040
Finally! I'm all aloney
on my owney.

152
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
Wow, great idea.
I'm starving too!

153
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,160
This apple is delicious.
What are you having, Gummy?

154
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,380
Oh, no!

155
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,000
It's the list that Twilight
helped me make yesterday

156
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,540
so I wouldn't forget all of
my Pinkie Promises today!

157
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,960
And I have three
more things to do.

158
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,840
Four if you count bringing those
snacks to Twilight's castle.

159
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,120
I've been getting liberal with
those Pinkie Promises lately.

160
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,860
Ooo! I want a flamingo!

161
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,700
I want a goldfish!

162
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,200
Surprise me!

163
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,660
Is that a baby bottle?

164
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,130
Aaah! No! It's a...uh...puppy.
Haha. Woof woof! Haha!

165
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,040
Are you sure? Because
it looks like a--

166
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,360
Next!

167
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,660
A baby pony, please.

168
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,200
Unless, of course that
would be a royal pain.

169
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,480
Interesting choice of
words, Featherweight.

170
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,360
Was it?

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,860
I don't know. Was it?

172
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,260
Uh, maybe you'd better
just make me a giraffe.

173
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,180
My! Your friends weren't kidding

174
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,400
when they said you had a
great filing system, Pinkie.

175
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,100
You are Ponyville's
best kept secret!

176
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,440
No, I'm not!

177
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,940
Speaking of secrets...

178
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,880
have you ever known
somepony else's secret?

179
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,160
No.

180
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,620
A surprise that was
so big and exciting

181
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
that it was all you
could think about?

182
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,380
Nope!

183
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh! Me, neither!

184
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,880
Oh, ho ho ho! That's just
what I wanted. Thanks, Pinkie.

185
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,700
You're welcome!

186
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,300
Oh, by the way, could
you help spread the word

187
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,180
about the big crib
sale I'm having?

188
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,400
"Treat your foal like royalty"?

189
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,760
Ha ha ha ha.

190
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,360
Pretty good slogan, huh? I
came up with it all by myself!

191
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,740
Well, I thought it was clever.

192
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,220
Those look yummy,
Pinkie! Let me help you.

193
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,420
But we'd better cover them
up so they don't get spoiled.

194
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
Why would they
get spoiled?

195
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,720
We're all going to
eat them super soon.

196
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,380
Oh, didn't
anypony tell ya?

197
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
Shinin' Armor and
Cadance are held up.

198
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,860
They might not arrive
until Saturday.

199
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,340
WHAT?

200
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,920
You mean... I have... to
wait... another whole day?

201
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,760
I don't know if I can!

202
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,240
Pinkie Pie, do you have
something you need to say?

203
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,540
You seem like you've been
keeping something in.

204
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Aaaahhhh!

205
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,640
We're here to listen.

206
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,900
Well, go on then, sugar cube.

207
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
We're not going to
judge you, darling.

208
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,560
You'll feel so much better once
you get it off your chest!

209
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,260
Come on. Whatever it is. You
can tell us. We're best friends!

210
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:54,660
Friends, friends,
friends. Tell, tell, tell.

211
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,900
Friends, friends,
friends. Tell, tell, tell.

212
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
OK! OK! You win!

213
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,380
SHINING ARMOR AND CADANCE
ARE GOING TO HAVE A--

214
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,880
... an awesome weekend
with the best little sister

215
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,820
in all of Equestria!

216
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,880
Hi, everypony.

217
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
Shining Armor!
Cadance! You're early!

218
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,180
I thought something had come up

219
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,860
and you weren't going to
make it until Saturday!

220
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,340
So did we. Turned out we
weren't needed in Maretonia

221
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,300
until next week.

222
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,780
And the summit we were
supposed to attend today

223
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,420
had to be
rescheduled so...

224
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,960
we got here even
sooner than planned.

225
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,300
Surprise!

226
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,660
It's wonderful to
see you all again.

227
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,060
I'm so glad you're here. I
have a big surprise for you!

228
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,320
Oh, yeah?

229
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,540
Lucky we came
when we did, huh?

230
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm guessing you saw the scroll
we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

231
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,220
Hey, I'm impressed you've been
able to keep our secret this long.

232
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,940
So you're gonna
tell Twilight now?

233
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,820
You're going to have to wait
just a little bit longer.

234
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,420
We have something
special planned.

235
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,580
It'll be worth it, I promise.

236
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,900
It'd better be.

237
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,000
So do ya think Shining
Armor liked his surprise?

238
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,780
Didn't you see him? He
couldn't stop raving about it!

239
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,600
Where did Shining Armor and
Cadance say they'd meet us?

240
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,360
I'm starving.

241
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,460
In the town square.

242
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,540
I wish they'd waited
to walk over with us,

243
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,920
but they said they had something
to take care of first.

244
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,200
They're going to have a lot
more to take care of soon.

245
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,220
What?

246
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,260
Nothing!

247
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,340
That's odd. Usually
they're quite punctual.

248
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,080
Ughhh, I need a hayburger
in my belly right now.

249
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,760
What's this?

250
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,440
What does it say?

251
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,600
A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor
used to set these up for me

252
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,480
when I was a filly.

253
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,300
At the end, there was always
a big prize like a new book,

254
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,940
or several new books, or--

255
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,800
We get the picture!
You like books!

256
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,400
So what's the first clue?

257
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,380
I hope it's something
about eating lunch.

258
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,040
"You've got a scroll,
you're on a roll.

259
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,220
Why don't you take a peek, where
young ones spend their week?

260
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,040
A piece of paper will
continue this caper."

261
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,720
I've got it!

262
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,760
"Where the young ones
spend their week!"

263
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,380
I'm not quite followin'...

264
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,180
It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse!

265
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,040
Good enough for me! Now
where's the next clue?

266
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,780
Ah-choo!

267
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,440
EXTRA! EXTRA! Get your Ponyville
News! Read it in the paper!

268
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,040
EXTRA! EXTRA!

269
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,660
"A piece of paper, will
continue this caper".

270
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,740
It's in the Foal Free Press!

271
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,820
Ooh! Look at that dress
Mayor Mare is wearing

272
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,680
in the social report.
Why, it's stunning!

273
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,100
Uh, didn't you make
that, Rarity?

274
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,920
Yes. What is your point?

275
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,600
FOCUS, EVERYPONY!

276
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,180
You know, there's
really no time limit

277
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,740
on these scavenger
hunts, Pinkie.

278
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,440
AHA! There!

279
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,220
"Though this hall
is rather small,

280
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,440
in it you'll find
files of all kinds.

281
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,960
Take a look on the back, of the
birth certificate of Applejack!"

282
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,340
I don't like where
this is goin'.

283
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,000
Baby! A ROYAL BAA---

284
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,540
Ahem!

285
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,240
Does anypony know where the
birth certificates are kept?

286
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,560
Ooo! I do! I do! Go down that
hall, then you take a left,

287
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,320
and then a right, then another
right, then a slight left,

288
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,580
then it's the third
door from the right.

289
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,240
Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you
knew so much about Town Hall.

290
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,640
There's a lot of
things I know...

291
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,500
that you don't know I know!

292
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,700
Oh, you're so cute!

293
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,660
"This next place is where,
you can buy a table or chair.

294
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,600
Or some comfy beds to
rest little heads."

295
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,800
Gah! Really? None of you?

296
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,600
It's obviously the furniture
store! Go in, go in, go in!

297
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,360
I don't know...

298
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,060
AHHHH! Fine.

299
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
Wow. You're scary good
at this, Pinkie Pie.

300
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,700
"It seems we've saved
the best for last,

301
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,820
we hope that you
have had a blast.

302
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,760
Now it's time to take a break,

303
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,900
where you can get
a slice of cake!"

304
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,000
Sugarcube Corner!

305
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,100
That was an easy one.

306
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,460
Surprise! Twily! Did you
like the scavenger hunt?

307
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,940
It was perfect.

308
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,100
Just like old times, except
even better because this time

309
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,940
I got to share it
with my best friends.

310
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,500
There's just one thing
missing, isn't there?

311
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,380
What's that?

312
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,760
The book prize at the end!

313
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,480
There's still a prize.

314
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,540
But it's a little
different this time.

315
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,300
Oh. I don't understand.

316
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,180
Hee hee hee.

317
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,140
All the places we sent you
today had something in common.

318
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,360
First we went to
the schoolhouse...

319
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
...and then we read
the Foal Free Press.

320
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,860
After that we found Applejack's
birth certificate...

321
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,500
...and then the last
clue was under a crib...

322
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,940
Hmm. School, foal, birth
certificate, and crib...

323
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,280
Can it be? Are you two...

324
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,760
WE'RE HAVING A BABY!

325
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,240
A baby, Twilight!
It's a baby! Woo hoo!

326
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,020
You mean... I'm
going to be an aunt?

327
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,380
This is the best prize ever!

328
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,440
Ooh, I love you guys.

329
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,180
And I can't wait to
meet your little foal!

330
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,700
Neither can we.

331
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,260
I DID IT! I DID IT!
I DID IT! I DID IT!

332
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,460
Go, Pinkie.

333
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,100
You did it, Pinkie Pie!
You kept it a surprise.

334
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,920
Thank you. Was it much trouble?

335
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,340
Piece o' cake!
