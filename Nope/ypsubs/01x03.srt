1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,517
No... nope...

2
00:00:02,632 --> 00:00:04,977
Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out.

3
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:08,845
I bet Big Macintosh I could get all these
Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime.

4
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:14,023
If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup
Street in one of Granny's girdles, heh heh.

5
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,783
No problem at all, Applejack.

6
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:20,387
But I'm glad, the goal is lunchtime.
All this hard work is making me hungry.

7
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:21,832
I know, right?

8
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:27,561
Oh really, Spike? You've been lounging
on my back all morning while we worked.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,845
Exactly! You two were taking
so long, I missed snacktime.

10
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:37,727
I guess be better get some food.

11
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:39,373
Nope... worm...

12
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:41,391
Aha!

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,307
Oh, Spike! That looks delicious...!

14
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,313
Spike!

15
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,999
What?

16
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:57,739
It's a letter from Princess Celestia!

17
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:00,998
Hear ye, hear ye.

18
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:04,592
Her Grand Royal Highness
Princess Celestia of Equestria...

19
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,029
...is pleased to announce
the Grand Galloping Gala...

20
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:11,777
...to be held in the magnificent capital
city of Canterlot on the 21st day of...

21
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,261
...yadda yadda yadda...

22
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:17,809
...cordially extends an invitation
to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest.

23
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:21,160
The Grand Galloping Gala!

24
00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:59,688
The Grand Galloping Gala!

25
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,941
Look! Two tickets!

26
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:12,456
Wow, great! I've never been to the Gala.
Have you, Spike?

27
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:17,949
No and I plan to keep it that way. I don't
want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense.

28
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:21,047
Oh, come on Spike! A dance would be nice.

29
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:24,413
Nice?! It's a hiccup more than just nice!

30
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,060
I'd love to go.

31
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:29,964
Land sakes! If I had an apple stand set up...

32
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:33,494
...ponies would be chewin' our tasty
vittles till the cows came home.

33
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,763
Do you have any idea how much business
I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres?

34
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:42,015
Why, with all that money we could
do a heap of fixin' up round here.

35
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:44,239
We could replace that saggy old roof.

36
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,194
And Big Macintosh could
replace that saggy old plow.

37
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:53,006
And Granny Smith could
replace that saggy old hip!

38
00:02:56,303 --> 00:03:00,137
Wow. I'd give my left hind
leg to go to that Gala.

39
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,894
Oh. Well, in that case, would you like to...

40
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:08,966
Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?

41
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:13,729
Rainbow Dash. You told me you were
too busy to help me harvest apples.

42
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,522
What were you busy doin'? Spyin'?

43
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,250
No. I was busy...

44
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:19,756
...napping.

45
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:24,131
And I just happened to hear
that you have an extra ticket?

46
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:27,252
-Yeah, but...
-Yes! This is so awesome!

47
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:33,239
The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping
Gala every year. I can see it now...

48
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:38,815
Everyone will be watching the sky.
Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts.

49
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:41,395
But then, in would fly...

50
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:43,564
Rainbow Dash!

51
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,825
I would draw their attention
with my Super Speed Strut.

52
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:57,065
Then I would mesmerize them
with my Fantastic Filly Flash.

53
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:04,863
And for my grand finale the Buccaneer Blaze!

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,140
The ponies would go wild!

55
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:16,650
The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature
moves be incorporated into their routine.

56
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:20,930
And then welcome me as their newest member.

57
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:31,724
Don't you see, Twilight? This could be
my one chance to show 'em my stuff.

58
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,533
You gotta take me!

59
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:36,455
Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here.

60
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,516
I asked for that ticket first.

61
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,996
So? That doesn't mean you own it.

62
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:47,304
Oh yeah? Well, I challenge you to
a hoof wrestle. Winner gets the ticket.

63
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:54,707
Girls! These are MY tickets!
I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much.

64
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:58,251
Whoever has the best reason to go,
should get the ticket, don't you think?

65
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:03,413
-Drummin' up business for the farm?
-A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts?

66
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,843
-Money to fix Granny's hip!
-Living the dream!

67
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:10,438
Oh my! Those are all pretty
good reasons, aren't they?

68
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,476
Listen to that. I am starving.

69
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,688
I don't know about you, but I can't make
important decisions on an empty stomach.

70
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:24,748
So I'll think about it over lunch
and get back to you two. Okay?

71
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:26,705
Okay.

72
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:36,877
So who you're gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?

73
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:40,633
I don't know, Spike. But I really
can't think straight when I'm hungry.

74
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:41,956
So where should we eat?

75
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:52,528
Bats! Bats on my face! HELP!

76
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:53,933
Wait! These aren't...!

77
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:57,223
Tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?!

78
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:03,080
It's the most amazing incredible tremendous
super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous
party in all of Equestria!

79
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,449
I've always always ALWAYS wanted to go!

80
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,630
<i>Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!</i>

81
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:11,919
<i>Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!</i>

82
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:15,176
<i>Hip hip hurray,
it's the best place for me!</i>

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,809
<i>For Pinkie!</i>

84
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,135
With decorations and streamers and fairy lights
and pinwheels and piñatas and pincushions...

85
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,416
With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes
and sundaes and sunbeams and sasparilla!

86
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:31,242
And I get to play my favoritest of favorite
fantabulous games like pin the tail on the pony!

87
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:34,801
<i>Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!</i>

88
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,063
<i>Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!</i>

89
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:43,740
<i>Cause it's the most gallerific
superly-teriffic gala ever in the whole Galaxy!</i>

90
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,287
Whee!

91
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,846
Oh thank you, Twilight!
It's the most wonderfulest gift ever!

92
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,837
Um... Actually...

93
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:57,889
Are these what I think they are?

94
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:02,922
Yes, yes, YES! Twilight's taking my to
the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!

95
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,330
The Gala!

96
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:10,165
I design ensembles for the Gala every year,
but I've never had the opportunity to attend.

97
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:15,461
Oh, the society, the culture, the glamor!
It's where I truly belong.

98
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,433
And where I'm destined to meet... HIM!

99
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:19,742
Him...!

100
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:21,589
Who?

101
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:22,651
Him.

102
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:27,859
I would stroll through the Gala
and everyone would wonder...

103
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,711
"Who is that mysterious mare?"

104
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:36,545
They would never guess that I was just
a simple pony from little old Ponyville.

105
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,335
Why, I would cause such a sensation...

106
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:44,229
...that I would be invited for an
audience with Princess Celestia herself!

107
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,962
And the Princess would be so taken
with the style and elegance...

108
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,567
...that she would introduce me to HIM!
Her nephew!

109
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,671
The most handsome, eligible
unicorn stallion in Canterlot!

110
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:00,285
Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt...

111
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:03,602
Our courtship would be magnificent.

112
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:06,926
He would ask for my hoof in marriage
and of course I would say...

113
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,032
YES!!!

114
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:11,503
We would have a royal wedding,
befitting a princess...

115
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,176
...which is what I would
become upon marrying him.

116
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,521
The stallion of my dreams.

117
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:25,956
Twilight! I simply cannot believe you would
invite Pinkie Pie, so she could party...

118
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:30,694
...and prevent me from meeting my true love!
How could you?!

119
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,330
Hey!

120
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,342
Angel! These are perfect!

121
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:45,453
Listen guys, I haven't decided
who to give the extra ticket to.

122
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:46,422
You haven't?!

123
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,908
Um... Excuse me...

124
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:53,153
Twilight, I would just like to ask...
I mean, if it would be all right...

125
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,332
...if you haven't given it to someone else...

126
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:58,747
You?! You want to go to the Gala?

127
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,402
Oh... no.

128
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:06,749
I mean... yes. Or actually, kind of. You see...

129
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,997
It's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala...

130
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:14,400
...as it is the wondrous private gated
garden that surrounds the dance.

131
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,411
The flowers are said the be the most
beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria!

132
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,007
For the night of the Gala and that night
alone will they all be in bloom.

133
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,042
And that's just the flora!
Don't get me started on the fauna.

134
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:31,318
There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my!

135
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,266
Hummingbirds that can really hum!

136
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,496
And buzzards that can really buzz!

137
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:41,143
And blue jays and red jays and green
jays, pink jays and pink flamingos.

138
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,127
Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful.

139
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,852
-Wait just a minute!
-Rainbow Dash!

140
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:51,326
Were you following me?

141
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:55,199
No... I mean, yes... I mean, maybe.
Look, it doesn't matter!

142
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:59,165
I couldn't risk a goody four-shoes like you
giving that ticket away to just anybody.

143
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:03,653
-Wait just another minute!
-Applejack! Were you following me too?

144
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:09,391
No. I was following this one to make
sure she didn't try any funny business.

145
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:12,658
-Still tryin' to take my ticket.
-YOUR ticket?!

146
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,336
But Twilight's taking me!

147
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,265
QUIET!

148
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:32,618
...and then I said "Oatmeal? Are you craz..." Oh.

149
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:35,206
Girls! There's no use in arguing!

150
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,713
But Twilight...!

151
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:40,141
This is my decision and I'm
gonna make it on my own...

152
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:42,599
...and I certainly can't think
straight with all this noise!

153
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:45,180
Not to mention hunger.

154
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:46,887
Now go on! Shoo!

155
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,478
And don't worry, I'll figure this out!

156
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:56,305
Somehow.

157
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,923
Oh Spike. What am I gonna do?

158
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:06,030
All five of my best friends have
really good reasons to go to the Gala.

159
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:11,413
Applejack, Rainbow Dash,
Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy, Rarity...

160
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,570
Oh, who should go with me?

161
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:18,229
Have you made your decision?

162
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:19,838
I CAN'T DECIDE!

163
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:22,448
Twilight, he just wants to take your order.

164
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:26,389
Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.

165
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:27,814
Do you have any rubies?

166
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:32,926
No? Okay, I'll have the hay fries. Extra crispy.

167
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:34,463
What do you think, Spike?

168
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:36,608
I think we have to try another restaurant.

169
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:40,869
I mean, I like grass just fine, but would
it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?

170
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,974
I mean about the Gala
and the ticket and who I should take!

171
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:47,457
-Oh, you're still on THAT?
-Spike, listen!

172
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:51,326
How do I choose? And when I do choose,
will the other four be mad at me?

173
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:53,962
I mean, I could give up
my ticket and give away two...

174
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:56,951
...but that would still leave three
disappointed ponies. What if I...

175
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:58,240
Ah, your food.

176
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:03,660
Oh, thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure
everything will be much clearer once I eat.

177
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,875
Um, Madame? Are you going to
eat your food in ze rain?

178
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,284
It's not raining.

179
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:16,507
What's going on?

180
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,698
Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had?
Enjoying the sunny weather?

181
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:23,335
Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?

182
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:27,882
Whadya mean? I just saw the smartest,
most generous pony about to get rained on...

183
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:30,432
...so I though I'd kick a hole
in the clouds to keep her dry...

184
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,657
...so she can dine at peace. That's all.

185
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:36,682
Rainbow. You're not trying to get extra
consideration for the extra ticket...

186
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,794
...by doing the extra special favors, are you?

187
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,300
Me? No no no, of course not!

188
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:47,283
Seriously, I'd do it for anypony.

189
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:55,731
Rainbow, I am not comfortable
accepting unwanted favors.

190
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:58,590
So I'd appreciate if you closed up
that rain cloud right now.

191
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,725
Fine.

192
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:03,504
That's better.

193
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:14,722
-Twilight! It's raining.
-No. Really?

194
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:16,971
Come with me before you catch a cold!

195
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:25,003
Oops. Sorry.

196
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,707
Oh no! It's quite all right.

197
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:33,129
After all, we are THE BEST OF FRIENDS,
are we not?

198
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:36,320
And you know what the best of friends do?

199
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:38,885
Makeover!

200
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:41,180
Ugh... Rarity...

201
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:52,034
There! Oh, you're simply darling!

202
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:55,426
Yeah... It is kinda pretty, isn't it?

203
00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:01,633
And you! Oh, Spike. I have a dandy
little outfit for the dashing gent.

204
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,537
-Oh, Spike.
-Now you just need a hat!

205
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:16,358
I told you! I don't want any part of this girly
gala gunk. See you back at the library!

206
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,470
Oh, who needs him anyway?
This is all about you!

207
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,902
And how fabulous you'll look
at the Grand Galloping Gala.

208
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:27,177
Wait. The Grand...

209
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,655
And, oh my goodness, what a coincidence!

210
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:34,978
I happen to have an ensemble
of my own that matches yours to a tee.

211
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:40,051
We would be the belles of the ball, you and I.
Everyone would be clamoring for our attention.

212
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:44,182
All eyes would be on us. And then everyone
would finally know, the most beautiful...

213
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,200
...most talented, most sophisticated
pony in all of Equestria...

214
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,780
...is Rarity the Unicorn!

215
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:55,093
And Twilight Sparkle, of course.

216
00:14:56,407 --> 00:15:00,117
I see what's going on. You're just
buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket.

217
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:01,645
Well, it's not gonna work!

218
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:04,585
You're going to have to wait for my
decision just like everyone else.

219
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:08,533
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been
trying all day just to get some lunch!

220
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:10,756
Did somepony say lunch?

221
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,966
You've got to be kidding me!

222
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:20,037
I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts,
apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumbles...

223
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,782
...aaand apple Brown Betty!

224
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,296
The dessert. Not my auntie.

225
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:27,701
What'd ya say there, best friend?

226
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,581
Is that a yes?

227
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,503
No! NO!

228
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:35,582
I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to!

229
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,417
And all these favors aren't
making it any easier to decide.

230
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:42,929
In fact, I'm less sure now
than I was this morning! Aaargh!

231
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,828
So... that's a maybe?

232
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:51,751
I never thought being showered with
favors would be so aggravating.

233
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,457
Fluttershy! Not you too...

234
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,679
Oh! Well, hello, Twilight.

235
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:07,816
I hope you don't mind but we're all
doing a little spring cleaning for you.

236
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:08,865
It's summer.

237
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:12,247
Oh. Well... better late than never, right?

238
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,499
It was Angel's idea.

239
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:19,318
You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?

240
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:25,459
Oh, no! I'm doing this because you're
my very best friend! Right, Angel?

241
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:30,307
Yes. We are just doing this for the ticket.

242
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:34,116
No no NO!

243
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,405
Well, this is all very nice of you and Angel...

244
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:39,588
...but I'm not accepting any extra favors
until I've made my final decision.

245
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,409
So I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

246
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,334
SURPRISE!

247
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:47,410
<i>Twilight is my bestest friend, whoopee! Whoopee!</i>
-Pinkie...

248
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:50,584
<i>She's the cutest, smartest, all-around best pony! Pony!</i>
-Pinkie...!

249
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:53,756
<i>I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party! Party!</i>
-Pinkie!

250
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:59,078
<i>She'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to meee!</i>
-PINKIEEE!!!

251
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:02,611
Yes, Twilight?

252
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:07,243
At least the other ponies *try*
to be subtle about the ticket!

253
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:10,766
-Wait... What ticket? What gala?
-Oh, you didn't know?

254
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,454
Twilight has an extra ticket
to the Grand Galloping Gala!

255
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:16,278
THE GRAND GALLOPING GALA?!

256
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:18,454
Have I ever told you how much
I love your mane?

257
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:19,612
I'll wash your dishes!

258
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:23,930
-Would you like any help with your gardening?
-I have a cartload of extra carrots.

259
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,160
What are we gonna do?

260
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:32,093
We're... gonna... RUUUUN!!!

261
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:22,614
Warn me next time you're gonna do that.

262
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:25,953
I didn't even know it was gonna happen!
Not quick, lock the doors!

263
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,199
I can't decide, I just can't decide!

264
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:41,532
It's important to all of you and I just
can't stand to disappoint any of you...

265
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:44,019
...and giving me gifts and doing me
favors won't make any difference.

266
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:49,333
Because you're all my friends and I wanna
make you all happy and I can't! I JUST CAN'T!

267
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:53,053
Twilight, sugar... I didn't mean to
put so much pressure on you.

268
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:58,310
And if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore.
You can give it to somepony else.

269
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,415
I won't feel bad, I promise.

270
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:05,087
Me too. I feel just awful
that I made you feel so awful.

271
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:08,284
And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends!

272
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,863
Twilight, it was unfair of me
to try to force you as I did.

273
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,417
YES! That means, the ticket is mine!

274
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:19,019
I've got the ticket, I've got the ticket...

275
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:26,512
You know... I haven't perfected my signature
moves for the Wonderbolts anyway.

276
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,732
I don't need that ticket either.

277
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,499
We all got so gung-ho about
going to the Gala...

278
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,735
...that we couldn't see how
ungung-ho we were makin' you.

279
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:37,100
We're sorry, Twilight!

280
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,264
Spike, take down a note.

281
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:44,694
Dear Princess Celestia. I've learned that one of
the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings.

282
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,171
But when it's not enough
blessings to go around...

283
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:50,195
...having more than your friends
can make you feel pretty awful.

284
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,906
So, though I appreciate the invitation...

285
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:56,054
...I will be returning both tickets
to the Grand Galloping Gala.

286
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,005
WHAT?!

287
00:19:57,104 --> 00:20:00,540
If my friends can't all go,
I don't wanna go either.

288
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:04,228
Twilight, you don't have to do that!

289
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:07,950
Nope, I've made up my mind.
Spike, you can send the letter now.

290
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:13,733
Now you won't get to go to the Gala either.

291
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,384
It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy
myself without my best friends there with me.

292
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,943
So I'd rather not go at all.

293
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,734
Well, wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like
a boy. Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.

294
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,363
Whoah, Nelly!

295
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:36,502
A letter from the Princess? That was fast!

296
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:41,703
My faithful student Twilight.
Why didn't you just say so in the first place?

297
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:45,343
Six tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala!

298
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,021
Now we can all go!

299
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,030
Allow us to treat you to dinner.

300
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,474
What a great way to apologise!

301
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:03,252
And to celebrate! Come on, everyone!
