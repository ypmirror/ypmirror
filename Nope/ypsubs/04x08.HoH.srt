<i>You're a life saver!</i>

158
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,677
Whew! I made it!

159
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:46,739
And with seconds to spare.

160
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,916
Hello, everypony!

161
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,295
Pleased to meet you all.

162
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,948
Rarity, I presume?

163
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:56,922
You must be Prim Hemline,
the host of this grand event.

164
00:07:57,674 --> 00:07:58,240
How do you--

165
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,677
Miss Rarity, how is it
that all your competitors

166
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,294
are here half an hour early,

167
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:04,817
and yet you arrive
seconds before we begin?

168
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,746
Oh, um, heh heh.
Just lucky I guess.

169
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:13,531
Once we're done here, you're
to finish setting up backstage,

170
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:16,152
so you'll be ready for your
run-through appointment.

171
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,323
You'll show your
designs last.

172
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,185
We keep to a precise schedule

173
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:23,030
so let's try to be more than
a few seconds early, hmm?

174
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:25,824
Tomorrow is the contest
to see which one of you

175
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:29,391
gets to stay to meet top
designers all across the city.

176
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,933
The rest of you
must go home early.

177
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,178
So sad.

178
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,551
Dismissed.

179
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,414
I'm so glad you
made it, Rarity.

180
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:43,211
Me too, but everything just
seems to keep working out.

181
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,981
Don't you remember me?

182
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:48,400
Suri Polomare, from the
Ponyville Knitter's League?

183
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:50,909
Oh! Yes of course, of course!

184
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:53,742
I thought you looked familiar
but I couldn't place it.

185
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:55,557
You haven't been
back in years.

186
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:59,851
Because I moved here to make it
in the big city. (laugh) OK?

187
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,721
Oh! Good for you, Suri!

188
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,817
It's so good to see you.

189
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,741
And now here we are...

190
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,032
Competing. (laugh) OK.

191
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,224
Yes, yes.

192
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:11,278
Well, good luck.

193
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:12,663
Oh, I don't need luck.

194
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,425
Would you like a hoof
with your things?

195

Why thank you so much.

196
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:20,208
My, your collection is gorgeous!

197
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:23,680
Oh now, I'm sure your
collection is equally lovely

198
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:24,745
if not more so.

199

It's all right, but
nothing like this!

200
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,262
Take my culottes, for example.

201
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,520
They are simply crying out
for just the right accent

202
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,166
but I haven't the
slightest notion where--

fabric could be perfect with it.

205

if I took a swatch?

Positive.

210
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:49,326
Well, it's been wonderful
getting caught up

211
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,786
and I... I don't wish to be rude,

212
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,320
but I need to finish
my preparations

213
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:54,618
and I am a bit late
as it... is?

214
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,700
Hello, I'm here
half an hour early

215

extra time to--

Quiet!

238
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:58,392
I pay an assistant to sew and
get coffee, not talk. OK?

(sob) How could this happen?

Aw sweetie, don't
blame yourself.

241
