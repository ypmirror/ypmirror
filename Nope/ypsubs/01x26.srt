1
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:09,003
I... can't... believe... the Grand...
Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:13,345
Pinkie! Please stop shouting.
I'm trying to concentrate.

3
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:17,053
Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now.

4
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:20,655
It's time to prepare for the Gala and I refuse to
let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.

5
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:27,129
What's Twilight doing?

6
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:30,251
She's got an awesome magic spell
she's been working on for the Gala.

7
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,310
Where are the others? It's getting late.

8
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,342
Hold your horses, girl. We're here.

9
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,440
Perfect! I'm ready.

10
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:37,449
For what?

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,603
All right, Spike.

12
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:40,267
An apple!

13
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:41,531
Are we having pie?

14
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,120
Shh! Watch!

15
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:53,814
Thanks. But that's just the start.

16
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:55,953
Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?

17
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:56,832
Yes.

18
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,909
Will they be safe, Twilight?

19
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,345
You have my word.

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,159
Ta-da!

21
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:16,582
Neat, huh? And don't worry.
They'll be mice again at midnight.

22
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,875
Opalescence, no!

23
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:23,142
Wait! Come back!

24
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:27,142
Those horses were supposed to
pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?

25
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,810
What ever shall we do?

26
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,818
Uh... ahem. Excuse me.

27
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,939
Uh, would you boys mind
pulling our carriage to the Gala?

28
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:41,595
Oh. Yeah.

29
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,989
Right.

30
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,560
Come on, you guys.

31
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:29,938
Let me in!

32
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:31,166
Sure thing, Spike.

33
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:33,505
Heavens no! We're getting dressed.

34
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:38,055
Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh...
we don't normally wear clothes.

35
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:43,906
I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.

36
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,597
I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight.

37
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:47,717
Our home town, Twilight!

38
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:51,721
And he best part is that we all get to
hang out together all night long!

39
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:53,890
Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.

40
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:57,767
We'll just have to see.

41
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:02,072
We're gonna be a mite busy.

42
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:05,006
Busy having fun!

43
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:08,686
Oh. Okay.

44
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:12,810
Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to
spend some time together.

45
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,014
Great!

46
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:17,349
Cause I planned out my
insider's tour of Canterlot.

47
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:21,260
I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels.
And Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree.

48
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:23,917
And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.

49
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,988
Then let's get moving! Hyah!

50
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,700
Excuse me!?

51
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,474
Um... I...

52
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:37,246
If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity...

53
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:03,287
Wow!

54
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,502
You all look...

55
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:08,554
...amazing!

56
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:11,277
I can't believe we're finally here!

57
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:15,048
With all that we've imagined, the reality
of this night is sure to make this...

58
00:04:15,193 --> 00:04:17,067
...the best night ever!

59
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,144
<i>At the Gala!
(At the Gala!)</i>

60
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:21,232
<i>At the Gala
In the garden</i>

61
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,320
<i>I'm going to see them all</i>

62
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,674
<i>All the creatures
I'll befriend them at the Gala</i>

63
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:27,541
<i>At the Gala!</i>

64
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,583
<i>All the birdies
And the critters</i>

65
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:31,775
<i>They will love me, big and small</i>

66
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:33,975
<i>We'll become good friends forever</i>

67
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:36,353
<i>Right here at the Gala</i>

68
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:38,360
<i>All our dreams will come true</i>

69
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,204
<i>Right here at the Gala! At the Gala!</i>

70
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:44,397
<i>At the Gala (It's amazing!)
I will sell them (Better hurry!)</i>

71
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:46,448
<i>All my appletastic treats (Yummy, yummy!)</i>

72
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,533
<i>Hungry ponies (They'll be snacking!)
They will buy them (Bringing money!)</i>

73
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,643
<i>Caramel apples, apple sweets (Give me some!)</i>

74
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,665
<i>And I'll earn a lot of money</i>

75
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,190
<i>For the Apple family</i>

76
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:59,172
<i>All our dreams and our hopes
From now until hereafter</i>

77
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:05,102
<i>All that we've been wishing for
Will happen at the Gala! At the Gala!</i>

78
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:07,354
<i>At the Gala
All the royals</i>

79
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:09,423
<i>They will meet fair Rarity</i>

80
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:12,599
<i>They will see I'm just as regal at the Gala</i>

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,523
<i>At the Gala!</i>

82
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:15,550
<i>I will find him
My Prince Charming</i>

83
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,792
<i>And how gallant he will be</i>

84
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:20,068
<i>He will treat me like a lady</i>

85
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,337
<i>Tonight at the Gala</i>

86
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:26,267
<i>This is what we've waited for
To have the best night ever</i>

87
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:32,283
<i>Each of us will live our dreams
Tonight at the Gala! At the Gala!</i>

88
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:40,159
<i>I've been dreaming
I've been waiting</i>

89
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,340
<i>To fly with those great ponies</i>

90
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,542
<i>The Wonderbolts
Their daring tricks</i>

91
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,498
<i>Spinning round and having kicks</i>

92
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,501
<i>Perform for crowds of thousands</i>

93
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:50,544
<i>They'll shower us with diamonds</i>

94
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:54,672
<i>The Wonderbolts will see me
Right here at the Gala</i>

95
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:58,677
<i>All we've come for, all we've dreamed
Our "happy ever after"</i>

96
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:04,557
<i>Finally they'll all come true
Right here at the Grand Gala! At the Gala!</i>

97
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,713
<i>I am here at the Grand Gala</i>

98
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,718
<i>For it is the best party</i>

99
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,694
<i>But the one thing it was missing</i>

100
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:12,880
<i>Was a pony named Pinkie</i>

101
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,960
<i>For I am the best at parties</i>

102
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:17,012
<i>All the ponies will agree</i>

103
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:19,348
<i>Ponies playing, ponies dancing</i>

104
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,757
<i>With me at the Grand Gala</i>

105
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:25,441
<i>Happiness and laughter at the Gala! At the Gala!</i>

106
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:31,811
<i>At the Gala (At the Gala!)
With the Princess (With the Princess!)</i>

107
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:33,926
<i>Is where I'm going to be (She will be!)</i>

108
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,013
<i>We will talk all about magic</i>

109
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:38,220
<i>And what I've learned and seen (She will see!)</i>

110
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,168
<i>It is going to be so special</i>

111
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,568
<i>As she takes time just for me</i>

112
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,624
<i>This will be the best night ever!</i>

113
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,800
<i>Into the Gala we must go
We're ready, now we're all aglow</i>

114
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:55,172
<i>Into the Gala let's go in
And have the best night ever</i>

115
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:59,181
<i>Into the Gala, now's the time
We're ready and we look divine</i>

116
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:01,343
<i>Into the Gala
Meet new friends</i>

117
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:03,498
<i>Into the Gala
Sell some apples</i>

118
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,456
<i>Into the Gala
Find my prince</i>

119
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,427
<i>Prove I'm great
As the Wonderbolt is</i>

120
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,670
<i>To meet, to sell, to find, to prove, to whoop, to talk</i>

121
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:15,110
<i>Into the Gala!
Into the Gala!</i>

122
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:22,119
<i>And we'll have the best night ever!</i>

123
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:25,071
<i>At the Gala!</i>

124
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,005
Yeah! This is gonna be the best night ever.

125
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:30,753
You know why? Cause we're all gonna
spend time at the Gala to...

126
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:33,994
...gether.

127
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:35,842
Or not.

128
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,232
Princess Celestia!

129
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,356
Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.

130
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:53,419
Oh, I'm so excited to be here!

131
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,319
We have so much to catch up on.

132
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,261
Well, I want you right by
my side the entire evening...

133
00:07:58,262 --> 00:07:59,913
...so we'll have plenty of time together.

134
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,291
That's just what I was hoping you'd say.

135
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:14,795
Hurry, Rarity...

136
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:15,915
Oh, but not too fast.

137
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,223
But don't wanna lose him...

138
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:17,877
WAIT!

139
00:08:17,878 --> 00:08:19,188
Have to play it cool.

140
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:20,570
Oh, but don't be cold!

141
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:23,467
I can't lose him, I can't!
He's everything I imagined!

142
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:28,623
Even better than I imagined.

143
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:37,614
Oh my! A meadowlark!

144
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:43,654
I think she's calling to me.

145
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,111
It's exactly what I wished for!

146
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:00,690
Howdy, partner! You hungry?

147
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:02,363
As a horse!

148
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:04,284
Well, what's you're hungering for?

149
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,011
Caramel apple? Apple pie?
Apple fritter? Apple fries?

150
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:09,538
I'll take that big apple pie!

151
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:11,401
Well, thank you kindly, sir!

152
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:14,332
Yeehaw! In the first minute.

153
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,855
I made my first sale. Just like I expected.

154
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,667
Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin'?

155
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,837
Yeah!

156
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:30,115
Mmmyyy pppiiieee!

157
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,395
You saved it! Thanks.

158
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,190
Hey, no prob.

159
00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:39,647
Hey! I know you.

160
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,545
You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale
and won The Best Flyer Competition.

161
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:46,160
Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.

162
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:49,723
Well, Rainbow Dash.
Looks like your skills saved us again.

163
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:52,600
Oh, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie.

164
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,109
Yeah...

165
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:57,698
Wanna come hang out with us?

166
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,078
Sure. Why not?

167
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,311
I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts!

168
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,388
The shiny dance floor...

169
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:14,513
The pretty party ponies...

170
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,217
The fancy band...

171
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:19,276
Shiny! Pretty! Fancy!

172
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:22,417
GOTTA DANCE!

173
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,661
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala</i>

174
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:29,182
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping Gaalaaa!</i>

175
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:30,778
<i>It's all I ever dreamed</i>

176
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:34,311
<i>It's all I ever dreamed! Woohoo!
It's all I ever dreamed! Yippee!</i>

177
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:38,643
<i>I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaAAAA!</i>

178
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,247
It's all I've ever... dreamed?

179
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:51,317
Well, hello.

180
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,774
I am Prince Blueblood.

181
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:56,029
I am... Rarity.

182
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,538
Oh my, what a lovely rose.

183
00:10:58,539 --> 00:10:59,411
You mean...

184
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,633
...this rose?

185
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:07,028
Thank you. It goes with my eyes.

186
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,684
My little meadowlark is right around this bend!

187
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,243
Was that you?

188
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:24,019
Yep! I love whistlin' while I work.

189
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,365
Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.

190
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:31,845
Oh!

191
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:35,511
I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey!

192
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:38,163
And, oh! Is that a wallaroo?

193
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,076
Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.

194
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,039
Hey, Spitfire!

195
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,909
You ever done a rain cloud double backflip?

196
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,660
You ever soared past lighting? It's awesome!

197
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:12,133
Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.

198
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:16,007
Princess! I've been so excited
to spend time with you and...

199
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:18,449
Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening!

200
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,621
Welcome to the Gala.

201
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:21,922
...which is why I...

202
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,902
Ladies! Lovely to see you again.

203
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:32,227
Looks like getting a chance to talk to
the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.

204
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:36,136
First minute, first sale.

205
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:37,805
Second...

206
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:39,116
Fourth...

207
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:40,515
Sixth...

208
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:43,160
Sixtieth minute... no sales.

209
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:46,444
This ain't what I expected at all.

210
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:51,484
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala...

211
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:54,563
...and it's not what I dreamed.

212
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:01,223
This isn't at all what I imagined.

213
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,765
This isn't what I hoped.

214
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:14,061
This isn't hanging out.

215
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,845
This isn't what I wished for.

216
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:20,494
No!

217
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,165
I waited all my life...

218
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,177
...for this moment.

219
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,689
And I'm not going to...

220
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,783
...let it slip by.

221
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:27,822
If it's the last thing I do...

222
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:29,453
...I'm gonna make this...

223
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:32,073
...the best night ever!

224
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,966
I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.

225
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,912
I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends!

226
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:47,370
But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!

227
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:51,939
Gotcha!

228
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,135
It's okay. I promise not to hurt you.
I just wanna be your...

229
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:58,237
...friend?

230
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,225
Mmm... Sounds good to me.

231
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:05,857
Come on, Rainbow!

232
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,718
If they don't notice you,
you gotta make them notice you.

233
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:34,119
Just give him a chance, Rarity.

234
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,955
His princely side is sure to come out
if you're just patient.

235
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,858
Miss Rarity! Stop!

236
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:40,470
Oh.

237
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,623
Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.

238
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,196
One would hate to slip.

239
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:47,431
Yes. "One" certainly would.

240
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,954
One's cloak should take care of the problem.

241
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,765
Oh, of course it will.

242
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,834
Come on everypony!

243
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:17,539
I know what will make you
shake those groove-thangs!

244
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:23,077
<i>You reach your right hoof in
You reach your right hoof out</i>

245
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:26,712
<i>You reach your right hoof in
And you shake it all about</i>

246
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:30,518
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Meeting lots of folks with clout</i>

247
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:33,184
<i>That's what I'm talking about</i>

248
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:37,688
<i>You step your left hoof in
You pull it right back out</i>

249
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:41,165
<i>You step your left hoof in
But you better help him out</i>

250
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,998
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
But you'd find a different route</i>

251
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,602
<i>That's what it's all about</i>

252
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:52,196
<i>You kick your back leg in
You pull your back leg out</i>

253
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:55,851
<i>You reach your back leg in
Just be brave and have no doubt</i>

254
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:59,600
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Feeling like you're gonna pout</i>

255
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:02,274
<i>That's what I'm singing about</i>

256
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:06,780
<i>You tilt your head in
You tilt your head out</i>

257
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:10,340
<i>You tilt your head in
Then you shake it all about</i>

258
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:14,000
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
Even though your date's a lout</i>

259
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:16,653
<i>You're better off without</i>

260
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:21,398
<i>You stomp your whole self in
You stomp your whole self out</i>

261
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,939
<i>You stomp your whole self in
And you stomp yourself about</i>

262
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,143
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
And you give a little shout</i>

263
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:28,989
COME OUT!

264
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,349
<i>That's what I'm talking about</i>

265
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:35,771
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey</i>

266
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:40,526
<i>You do the Pony Pokey
And that's what it's all about</i>

267
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:41,603
YEAH!

268
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:45,463
Young lady, this is not *that* kind of partay.

269
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:49,253
Ooooooh...

270
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:50,723
They don't want a party.

271
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:53,911
These ponies want a paaartaaay!

272
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,223
Two apple fritters, please.

273
00:16:57,534 --> 00:16:59,549
Two apple fritters comin' right up.

274
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,547
That'll be four bits.

275
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:08,929
I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?

276
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:10,426
It's okay, Rarity.

277
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:11,472
I got you covered.

278
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:16,885
Thank you, Applejack. At least
somepony here has good manners.

279
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:21,521
Oh!

280
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:24,669
Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples!

281
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,985
My royal lips have touched common carnival fare!

282
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:31,279
I'm going to the buffet for
some... hors d'oeuvres.

283
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:35,038
Well, no wonder nopony wants my food.

284
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,599
They're fillin' up on all those
fancy-schmancy vittles.

285
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,817
Well, my down-home apples are
plenty good enough for this crowd.

286
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:43,322
I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.

287
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,946
I'll catch you yet, my pretties.

288
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:53,339
Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds
or monkeys or bears touches this net...

289
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,786
...you'll be MINE! MINE!!!

290
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:06,730
Come on, everypony!

291
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:08,953
You wanted a partay?

292
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,096
Now it's paaartaaay!

293
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,838
Yeah!

294
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,623
Now that's a beat, yeah!

295
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:16,139
C'mon, dance!

296
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:19,415
Yeah, woohoo!

297
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:22,902
Okay, all you high-class ponies.

298
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:28,026
Here's a highfalutin apple cake for
all your hoity-toity taste buds.

299
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,547
STAGE DIVE!

300
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:43,839
You, sir, are the most UNCHARMING
prince I have EVER MET!

301
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,079
Seems like the only thing royal about you
is that you are a ROYAL PAIN!

302
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,626
Ewww...!

303
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,688
Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!

304
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:53,122
Afraid to get DIRTY?!

305
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:01,487
This is my chance!

306
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,073
Yes!

307
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,527
Well... it can't get any worse.

308
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:36,738
You're... going to LOVE ME!!!

309
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:44,845
Run.

310
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,361
Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper!

311
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,355
Now your prince is sure to find you.

312
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,588
No!

313
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:03,072
Let's go!

314
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:08,764
Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.

315
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:10,433
Don't you think you've had enough?

316
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:13,007
Another donut! Extra sprinkles!

317
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,077
Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha.

318
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:18,387
Long time no see.

319
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:21,295
Hey, how was the Gala?
How was your best night ever?

320
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:25,119
That sounds like the worst night ever!

321
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,620
It was!

322
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:33,435
I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset
at us for ruining the Gala.

323
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,168
That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!

324
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:39,058
Princess Celestia?!

325
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:40,975
Pardon me, Princess...

326
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,754
...but tonight was just awful.

327
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:47,570
Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala
is always awful.

328
00:20:47,754 --> 00:20:48,680
It is?

329
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:51,161
That is why I was thrilled you were all attending.

330
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,615
I was hoping you could liven things up a bit.

331
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:56,336
And while the evening may not
have gone as you planned...

332
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:58,424
...I'm sure you'll agree that in the end...

333
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,703
...it didn't turn out so bad
for this group of friends.

334
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:02,288
You're right, Princess.

335
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:06,676
Friends have a way of making even the worst
of times into something pretty great.

336
00:21:06,677 --> 00:21:08,556
Yeah! Hanging out with friends!

337
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,750
-Talking!
-Laughing!

338
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:14,551
You mean doing exactly what
I wanted to do the whole time?

339
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:16,548
Yes, Spike. You were right.

340
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:18,841
As horrible as our night was...

341
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,603
...being together here has made it all better.

342
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:23,598
In fact, it's made it...

343
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,004
...the best night ever!

344
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,530
