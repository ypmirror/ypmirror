1
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,109
Hear ye! Hear ye!

2
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:15,114
The Ponyville Foal and Filly
Fair is almost ready to begin!

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,220
Whee! Ha ha!

4
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:23,180
Ha ha!

5
00:00:23,194 --> 00:00:23,978
Hee hee hee!

6
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:28,314
Just because the
attendees are young,

7
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:31,412
doesn't mean they don't deserve
my very best creative work.

8
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,906
Why, this puppet theatre
is going to be the talk

9
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:35,724
of the Foal and Filly Fair.

10
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:38,138
How could it not be?

11
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:40,216
You're the one making it.

12
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:43,110
Oh, but I couldn't have
done it without the help

13
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:45,822
of one of my dearest and
most supportive friends.

14
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,911
You are my favorite dragon.

15
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:51,225
Your favorite dragon?

16
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,700
Aw, gee.

17
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,813
The hours have been long, the
work taxing beyond compare,

18
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:58,940
but it will all be
worth it when we hear

19
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,604
those three little words--

20
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,080
<i>This is awful!</i>

21
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:04,050
Awful?

22
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:07,166
Completely unusable.

23
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,239
Hmmm.

24
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,306
It doesn't travel!

25
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:15,414
There's no room for my puppets!

26
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,613
It appears I won't have a
travelling puppet theatre

27
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,644
to use after all.

28
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,736
I don't know what that
guy was talking about.

29
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:30,476
This thing is perfect.

30
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,766
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu</i>

31
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,953
<i>This is terrible.</i>
<i>Simply terrible!</i>

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,084
So that puppeteer didn't like
your exquisitely crafted,

33
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:23,065
best puppet theatre in the
history of puppet theatres

34
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:23,884
puppet theatre.

35
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:27,065
You can just contribute
something else

36
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:28,429
to the Foal and Filly Fair.

37
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,520
I suppose I could.

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,247
Forget it, Spike.

39
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:36,640
I'd never have something
finished in time.

40
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:46,608
I wanted to leave my
creative mark on the fair

41
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:47,742
and I have failed.

42
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,549
Mmm.

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,805
Miserably.

44
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:55,824
And that makes me miserable.

45
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:08,745
There's gotta be something
in here somewhere.

46
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:09,738
Hoo!

47
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:12,085
It's not who, it's what.

48
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,402
Like what can help Rarity make
something in time for the fair?

49
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:19,377
She really, really, really wants
to make a creative contribution.

50
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,434
She said I'm her
favourite dragon.

51
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:23,959
So it's up to me to come through
for her in her time of need.

52
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,779
There's gotta be some kind of
spell that'll do the trick.

53
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:30,597
<i>Hoo!</i>

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,071
Come on, help a dragon out!

55
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:35,149
Hoo!

56
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:37,920
Hoo!

57
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:41,732
Hoo!

58
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:42,768
Agh!

59
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:44,236
It's not for me!

60
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,143
It's for Rarity.

61
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,697
The one who made you that
bow tie you liked so much.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,932
Hoo hoo!

63
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,020
OK. I get it.

64
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:54,663
You don't think we
should use magi--

65
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,441
What is that?

66
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,568
Hoo! Hoo!

67
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,062
Hoo! Hoo!

68
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,230
Hoo! Hoo!

69
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:31,332
What?

70
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:34,259
If I wasn't supposed to have it,
it wouldn't be so easy to get.

71
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:37,010
And it's covered
in spikes, like me!

72
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:38,720
Hoooo!

73
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:42,710
Hooo!

74
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,843
"Inspiration Manifestation,
instantly brings ideas to life."

75
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:52,780
I'm liking the
looks of this one!

76
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,179
Hmm.

77
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,211
Rarity!

78
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,026
Leave me be!

79
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,274
Can't you see how
distraught, disappointed

80
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,978
and downtrodden I still am?

81
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,936
But I brought you something.

82
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,282
Unless it's another carton
of Vanilla Oat Swirl

83
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:24,897
or word that the festival
has been cancelled,

84
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,555
I don't think I'm interested.

85
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,715
It's magic.

86
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,867
Spike, Precious Scales,
I already have magic.

87
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:38,247
But not the kind that can
help you create something

88
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:39,865
in time for the fair.

89
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,555
This can!

90
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,043
I suppose it's worth a try.

91
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:48,427
From in the head to
out in the world.

92
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,454
Every thought to action.

93
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,886
Hold close this book,
and through its spell,

94
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,927
you'll start a chain reaction.

95
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:59,432
Projecting forth
whatever beauty you see.

96
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:04,593
Only when true words are spoken,
will you finally be set free.

97
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:06,339
Did it work?

98
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:08,940
There's only one
way to find out.

99
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:16,167
Oh my!

100
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,110
I thought about making this a
much more beautiful spell book

101
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,741
and I have!

102
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:28,928
Dear, dear, Spike, here
I was about to give up,

103
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:33,145
but like a true friend, you've
come through with flying colors.

104
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,430
Come! We must find the
puppeteer right away

105
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,923
so that I may provide him with
the most fabulous theatre

106
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,447
he's ever imagined.

107
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:47,038
Or should I say that
I've ever imagined.

108
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:00,290
Ah, Miss Rarity, come to
see the show, I presume.

109
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:04,938
You'll notice I had to make
do in light of your recent

110
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,959
failure to produce a
functioning theatre.

111
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:16,364
Oh, but I think you'll find
the new one I've created

112
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:18,671
will be much more
to your liking.

113
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:27,639
Hmm yeah well, it is gorgeous,

114
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,836
but that was never the
problem now, was it?

115
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,473
Oh, well this one
does seem to travel.

116
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:41,040
Plenty of room for my puppets.

117
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:43,863
I say, Miss Rarity, I don't
know how you managed to do so

118
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:45,744
in such a short amount of time,

119
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:48,776
but you seem to have
redeemed yourself.

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,809
How did you manage to do
so in such a short time?

121
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:55,695
As a matter of fact,
she used a sp-

122
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,476
A good designer never
reveals her tricks.

123
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,498
Thank you again, Spike, for
being such a dear friend

124
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,631
and finding this book for me.

125
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,453
My pleasure.

126
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,119
Well, guess I can return it
now that the fair is over.

127
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:15,223
Yes, of course.

128
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:18,027
I've made my creative
contribution as I'd hoped to do,

129
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,221
and all is well.

130
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:28,409
Then again, perhaps I should
keep it just a skotch longer.

131
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:29,966
You don't mind do you, Spike?

132
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,282
Of course not!

133
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:34,390
See you tomorrow.

134
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:38,677
What?

135
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,360
She'll keep it for
a few more hours.

136
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,580
No harm in that.

137
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:52,339
Rarity?

138
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,556
Wha!

139
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:00,101
Spike! I'm so glad
you're here!

140
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,222
Whoa!

141
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:11,566
Are you OK?

142
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:13,438
Oh! I've never been better.

143
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,744
This book you've
given me is amazing!

144
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,737
Why, I've been up all night
just creating and creating

145
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,089
and creating and creating!

146
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:24,066
I've completed my fall line
for the next fifteen seasons!

147
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:25,184
Wow!

148
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:28,039
But then I started
thinking, why stop there?

149
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,835
Oh, Spike, I've always
thought this town of ours

150
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,616
could use a few
beautifying upgrades.

151
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,676
And with this book, I can make
that happen with such ease.

152
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,675
You will support me in this
endeavor by letting me

153
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,569
keep the book just
a little longer?

154
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,305
Of course I will!

155
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,444
Hoo!

156
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:55,194
What do you say we get a little
breakfast before we get started?

157
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,439
No time for breakfast.

158
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,363
I want to get
started right away.

159
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,766
Technically, we do have time

160
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,103
because with that
book held close

161
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,260
you can just
make things--

162
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:06,132
Rarity?

163
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:12,844
Now this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

164
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,592
Why that cart hasn't an
ounce of stylish flair.

165
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,400
My eyes playin'
tricks on me again?

166
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,730
What in rhubarb
pie just happened?

167
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,611
Isn't it gorgeous?

168
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,106
It's amazing!

169
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,852
You should ask Applejack
if she wants you

170
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:39,059
to give all the Apple
family carts a makeover!

171
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:42,427
Oh, I don't really think I need
to ask permission, darling.

172
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,638
Everyone loves surprises.

173
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,985
Especially when they're
gorgeous ones.

174
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,101
You're right!

175
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,132
Everypony does love surprises!

176
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,847
We shouldn't even tell
anypony that it's me

177
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:56,136
who is behind all the fabulous
changes I'll be making.

178
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,057
Won't that be a
fun little secret

179
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,561
for the three of
us to share?

180
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,990
The... three of us?

181
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:07,982
You, me, and the
book, of course.

182
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,071
My marvellous,
marvellous book.

183
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:15,955
Of course.

184
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:18,989
Promise me you won't
say a word to anypony?

185
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:21,455
You got it!

186
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,906
I knew I could
count on you, Spike.

187
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:26,485
And I also know just
what I want to do next.

188
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:29,929
Take that!

189
00:11:30,183 --> 00:11:31,235
And that!

190
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:33,367
Ha ha.

191
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:35,486
What in the--

192
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:39,258
Get. It. Off. Of. Me!

193
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:42,405
I've always thought
Rainbow Dash

194
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:43,941
could use a little more glamour.

195
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:45,319
And now look at her!

196
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,332
Cloud-busting with style!

197
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,841
Moving on!

198
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,425
She'll be fine.

199
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:53,631
It's just a dress.

200
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:56,202
Wait for your favorite dragon!

201
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,093
<i>♪ La la la la la la </i>

202
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,867
There you go, Mr. Robin.

203
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,492
Don't you look so content
in your little house.

204
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,756
Oh my goodness!

205
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:20,653
You're lost?

206
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,180
No. Not that way.

207
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,640
That looks like that's
a door to a bedroom.

208
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:27,176
Try that one over there.

209
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,211
No. No.

210
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:30,374
That leads to a...

211
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,520
shoe closet?

212
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:33,551
Oh dear.

213
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,253
Maybe try the staircase?

214
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,617
No. No. No. The
other staircase.

215
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:39,463
Isn't it gorgeous?

216
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:42,844
It's probably the most beautiful
bird house ever created...

217
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:43,625
Go on.

218
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:46,606
I'm just not sure how
the bird feels about it.

219
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:50,979
Pfft. What does a bird know
about architectural design?

220
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,819
What matters is what you
think, Spike, and you love it.

221
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,792
Don't you?

222
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:58,271
Of course I do!

223
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,750
It's so... "Rarity".

224
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,566
It is, isn't it.

225
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,361
Oooh!

226
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,310
Oh, adorable!

227
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,438
But it could use a touch
of class, don't you think?

228
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,957
Oh. Yeah. Definitely!

229
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,410
This party doesn't even
seem to have a proper theme.

230
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,243
Let's do something
about that, shall we?

231
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,024
You've already made things
look really, really great.

232
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:51,580
Maybe you should stop
while you're ahead?

233
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,123
You're right, Spike.

234
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,477
There's so much
to do elsewhere.

235
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:56,448
Right.

236
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,916
Elsewhere.

237
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,575
Just one more little
thing before we go.

238
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:08,241
Why, this party is certain
to make the society page now.

239
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:11,613
Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased?

240
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:14,907
Happy happy day to--huh?

241
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:21,348
I am simply buzzing with ideas.

242
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:22,647
Simply buzzing!

243
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:25,588
That's great!

244
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,581
But, uh, you've been at
this for a while now.

245
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:29,904
How about you take a break?

246
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,170
Give that brilliant
mind of yours a rest.

247
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:33,112
<i>Don't be silly.</i>

248
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,225
I'm not going to stop now.

249
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:38,323
Why, I won't stop until
every inch of Ponyville

250
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,245
has benefited from
my creative vision.

251
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,580
Starting with you, Spike!

252
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:52,887
You.

253
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:53,562
Look.

254
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:54,842
Fabulous!

255
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:57,371
All because of you!

256
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:01,738
Anything for my favorite dragon
and most supportive friend.

257
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:04,439
Come! There's so
much more to do!

258
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:09,506
Oh, no!

259
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:10,720
Not you, too.

260
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,776
What do you mean "not me, too"?

261
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:18,163
Oh, judging by that outfit, I
thought for sure you'd--

262
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,284
What? This?

263
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,934
I just wanted to
try out a new look.

264
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,040
You like?

265
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:25,371
Hmm.

266
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:28,999
Well, in that case, have you
seen anypony suspicious around?

267
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:30,731
Uh, nope.

268
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:35,978
Princess Twilight!

269
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,136
The gazebo has been
turned into solid crystal

270
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,807
and two ponies are now
trapped inside its walls!

271
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:48,325
Hoo!

272
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,074
No! I made a promise to Rarity
to keep this to myself.

273
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:53,104
Hoo!

274
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:57,274
But you're right
Owlowiscious, I have to tell.

275
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,010
And once I do, I can forget
Rarity thinking of me

276
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,755
as her most supportive friend.

277
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,486
I can forget Rarity thinking
of me as a friend at all.

278
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,008
I can't do it.

279
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:22,589
I promised I'd keep all of
this between the three of us.

280
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,191
Hoo!

281
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,026
Of course, it's weird
that she meant me, her,

282
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:28,150
and the spell book, but--

283
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,065
The spell book! Of course!

284
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:32,675
If I can get it away from her,

285
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,891
I bet she won't be able
to use its magic anymore.

286
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,360
<i>Oh, come on! It's</i>
<i>the perfect plan.</i>

287
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:41,890
I just have to figure
out which way she went.

288
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:43,340
<i>I can't see!</i>

289
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,543
I'm thinking she's
headed this way.

290
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:09,566
What do you think
you're doing?

291
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:15,112
Me? I was just uh, basking
in your creative radiance.

292
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:19,810
Oh, Spike, you do say
the nicest things!

293
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:21,174
Thanks.

294
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:23,449
Now where was I?

295
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,105
Oh, yes!

296
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:31,680
Gold-plated roof-tops
for everypony!

297
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,048
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

298
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:40,803
Spike!

299
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,864
I have just had the
most marvellous idea!

300
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:53,125
Of course you have;
you're Rarity.

301
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,669
My work here in Ponyville
is nearly complete.

302
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:59,947
Don't you think it's time
the rest of Equestria

303
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:01,840
benefited from my
creative vision?

304
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,781
Absolutely!

305
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm thinking we go by chariot.

306
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,803
Or as everyone will soon
be calling them, "Rariot".

307
00:18:13,006 --> 00:18:15,342
Oh, yeah! We should
definitely go by--

308
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,714
How...how did you do that?

309
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,960
Why, whatever do you mean?

310
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:28,232
The book. It's... I
mean... you don't...

311
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,000
It's gone.

312
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,240
The book is gone.

313
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:32,115
Gone?

314
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,424
Why it's right there.

315
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,106
I need my book, Spike!

316
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,026
What have you done
with my book?

317
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,807
Why would I do anything
with your book?

318
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,029
We're friends.

319
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:46,720
It was probably the owl!

320
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:48,872
Hoo!

321
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:53,459
But, wait, I don't seem
to need it anymore, do I?

322
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:56,087
Yes! Yes!

323
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,469
I can feel its magic
flowing within me now.

324
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,024
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!

325
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:04,798
I'm so scared.

326
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,647
<i>Oh, the places</i>
<i>we'll go, Spike.</i>

327
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:07,935
Manehattan.

328
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:09,063
Phillydelphia.

329
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,107
Canterlot.

330
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:12,448
And there you'll
be by my side.

331
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,499
Just as you've always
been here in Ponyville.

332
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,157
Your constant praise and
adoration driving me

333
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:18,349
to even greater heights

334
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,265
until there isn't an
inch of Equestria

335
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:22,115
that hasn't been
utterly transformed

336
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,326
by my creative genius!

337
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:32,325
No!

338
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:34,868
What did you say?

339
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,206
I said, "No!"

340
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:37,828
You've been changing things,

341
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:39,182
but you haven't been
making them better.

342
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,964
I should have told you the
truth at the very beginning,

343
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:42,626
but I didn't

344
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,579
because I was trying to be
a supportive friend.

345
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:50,124
But instead I let you
become something awful.

346
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,208
Awful?

347
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:05,326
What happened?

348
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,892
Rarity, you're OK?

349
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:10,569
I...I think so.

350
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:14,788
Though by the looks of it,
something quite terrifying

351
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,552
has happened to Ponyville.

352
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:18,760
You happened.

353
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:20,144
Me?

354
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:23,564
The last part of the spell!

355
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:26,846
"Only when true
words are spoken,

356
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:29,539
will you finally be set free."

357
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,228
The spell took over you

358
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:34,195
and you wanted to change
everything in Equestria.

359
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,399
I was afraid to tell you
how I really felt about it,

360
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,462
but then I, I told
you the truth.

361
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:45,034
Dearest Spike, you should never
be afraid to tell me the truth.

362
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:46,944
We're friends, remember?

363
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:52,597
<i>Today I learned how important it is</i>

364
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,009
<i>to be honest with your friends</i>

365
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,283
<i>when they're doing something</i>

366
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,708
<i>that you don't think is right.</i>

367
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,190
A true friend knows
that you're speaking up

368
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,612
because you care about them.

369
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,304
Spike!

370
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,246
Never, ever, ever take another
book out of the library

371
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,453
at the Castle without asking.

372
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:11,229
Princess Cadance
and Princess Luna

373
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:14,005
have much better things to do
than help me clean up Ponyville.

374
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,565
Do you have any idea how
hard it was to reverse

375
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:19,910
that much dark magic?

376
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,451
You don't look so good.

377
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:25,592
What?

378
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:27,010
I'm just being honest.

379
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,682
It's what good friends do.
