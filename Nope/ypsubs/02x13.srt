1
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:11,621
Can you believe the new baby is finally here?

2
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:14,922
Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!

3
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:17,281
I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?

4
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:22,448
I wanna see the new baby pony!
I wanna see! Which one is it?!

5
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,481
Meet our son, Pound Cake.

6
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:35,553
And our daughter, Pumpkin Cake.

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,958
Two new foals for me to play with?

8
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:43,551
That's two, two, two times the fun!

9
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:45,503
This is the greatest day ever!

10
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,329
We need to celebrate your birthday, babies!

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,646
'Cause you were just born today!

12
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:54,859
Shhh. The babies are trying to sleep.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,764
- But I was just...
- Shhh.

14
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,274
- But...
- Shhh!

15
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,038
Happy happy birthday,
to you and you today!

16
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:12,467
Now, how in thunderation is one of them twins a pegasus...

17
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:14,596
...and the other one a unicorn?

18
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:18,383
Easy. My great great great great
grandfather was a unicorn.

19
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:22,583
And Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin
twice removed was a pegasus.

20
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:23,973
That makes sense, right?

21
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:26,991
Aw yeah, just you wait!

22
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:28,866
Once little Pound Cake gets his wings going...

23
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,801
...he'll be all over the place!

24
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:32,924
And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.

25
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:36,375
Baby unicorns get strange magic
surges that come and go.

26
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:39,111
Quick! Make a wish and
blow out your candles!

27
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:40,875
Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles!

28
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:44,403
- You are zero years old, after all!
- Shhh!

29

30
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:34,776
Happy monthiversary
to you and you today!

31
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:36,725
I can't believe you're already
a month old time sure flies...

32
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:38,323
...it seems like only yesterday you weren't born!

33
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,645
But now you're a month old today, hey!

34
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,625
Are you ready for your favoritest
game in the whole wide world?

35
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:56,377
Where's Pinkie Pie...?

36
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:57,858
Here I am!

37
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:00,535
Where's Pinkie Pie...?

38
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,053
Here I am!

39
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:05,478
Where's Pinkie Pie...?
Here I am!

40
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:07,991
Here I am!

41
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,328
Here I am!

42
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,844
Here I am!

43
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:14,320
Everything okay in there?

44
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,734
Who needs a diaper change?

45
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:19,258
Don't worry, they're fine!

46
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,482
I mean...

47
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:24,824
I got it.

48
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,024
Is anypony hungry?

49
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,517
No thanks.
I just had a big breakfast.

50
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:46,696
I'm on it.

51
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:05,360
You're making funny faces!
I have one!

52
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:10,161
No, you see, Pinkie, the babies need to be burped.

53
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,085
All set now?
Everything good?

54
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:19,381
Okay, who wants to play again?

55
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:29,148
Pound Cake, no pounding things.

56
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:38,048
We don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake.

57
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:39,443
Except food.

58
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:43,527
Food! Great cinnamon sticks,
I completely forgot!

59
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:45,717
No, you just fed them bottles, remember?

60
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,778
Not the babies' food!

61
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:51,784
The food for the enormously big catering
order we have to deliver today!

62
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:55,347
With the new twins, we've been so distracted!

63
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:56,506
Quick, honeybun!

64
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:59,972
We need to find a babysitter to watch
the foals while we take care of this.

65
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,965
I could do it!
I wanna do it!

66
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,095
The babies love playing with me, I'll do it!

67
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,492
Wonder who would be available
on such short notice...

68
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:10,903
Me! Me!
Pick me!

69
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:16,169
I would love to babysit!

70
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,333
But I can't today, sorry.

71
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,679
I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic.

72
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,605
You understand, don't you?

73
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,358
You're not mad at me, are you?
Please don't be mad at me!

74
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,111
I'll do it!
Pick me!

75
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,340
I have to finish this report for the Princess...

76
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:36,221
...summarizing all my other reports to the Princess.

77
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,507
I wanna babysit!
Pick me!

78
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,196
Babysit?
Now?

79
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:49,077
When there's a swarm a' hungry
caterpillars headed this way?

80
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:52,523
I gotta get all these apples picked
before they get swarmed on!

81
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:58,331
I wanna do it!

82
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,226
I got tickets to the Wonderbolts
airshow this afternoon.

83
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:04,427
Gotta dash!

84
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:10,502
Ask me!
Mememememememememe!

85
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,267
Moi?
Babysit?

86
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:18,260
Nononononono.

87
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:21,693
I'm flattered that you would think about me though.

88
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:33,977
Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us.

89
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:37,784
I dunno.
I'll have to check my schedule.

90
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:47,612
Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand

91
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,662
the responsibility of watching over two babies?

92
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:54,935
I can be responsible.
Why, responsibility is my middle name.

93
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,070
Pinkie Responsibility Pie!

94
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,963
But this time you need to take care of them.

95
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,923
Not just play with them.

96
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:04,397
You have to be responsible.

97
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:08,225
Yes, I know.
I will, I am.

98
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,105
Here you are, dearie.

99
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:16,110
All your responsibilities are on this list.

100
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:20,687
That's a lot of responsi...
Consider it done.

101
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:24,154
We'll frost it when we get there!

102
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:26,441
C'mon, sugarplum, tick tick!

103
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,634
Take good care of our two precious little ginger snaps!

104
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:33,244
No problemo, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

105
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,516
Everything is under control.

106
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,808
Don't cry, little friends!
Look, look!

107
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,714
Where's Pinkie Pie?
Where's Pinkie Pie?

108
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:06,477
Oh no... I'm right here, see!

109
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,376
Think, think, think...

110
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,228
Hey guys, watch this!

111
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:25,312
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight!

112
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:26,513
Where y'all from?

113
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,219
Well, that's great.

114
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,839
Y'know, I used to have an ant farm,
but I had to get rid of it...

115
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,172
...because I couldn't find tractors that small!

116
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,778
Get it?

117
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,628
Tractors that small?

118
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:48,089
The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog.

119
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,065
And now I can't find him!

120
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,740
Gee, tough crowd.

121
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:59,693
Tell me about it.

122
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:04,131
Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper...

123
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:08,085
...but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!

124
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:11,606
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

125
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,565
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

126
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,425
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

127
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,269
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

128
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,094
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

129
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,880
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

130
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:22,571
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

131
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,351
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

132
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:25,924
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

133
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:27,584
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

134
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:29,123
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

135
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:30,765
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

136
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,250
There, see?

137
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,860
Nothing to this babysitting business!

138
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,696
Snack time.
That's easy enough.

139
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,801
Okie dokie!

140
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,250
Eat up!

141
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,816
Like this!

142
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:14,820
No, Pumpkin Cake.
We eat food, not tablecloths.

143
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:25,483
Hey guys, look at me!

144
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,515
Yeah.... I think I can see
where this is going.

145
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:56,327
Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!

146
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:58,382
Stop it...

147
00:10:58,683 --> 00:10:59,683
Stop it...

148
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:01,535
Stop it!

149
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,785
Look guys, bubbles!

150
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:42,851
Don't cry, look, look, floating things!

151
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,422
Don't make me do it, guys.

152
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:12,387
You know what happens when you
mix flour and water, don't you?

153
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:37,569
Smells like somepony needs me
to changie-wangie their...

154
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,703
...diaper-wiper right now-ow-ow!

155
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:53,711
Easy... easy...

156
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,859
Stand still, I've almost...

157
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:27,475
You've gotta be kidding me.

158
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:30,170
Thank goodness they're home!

159
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,411
Hi!
I finished up the work I had to do...

160
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,999
...so I thought I'd stop by and
see if you needed any help.

161
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:40,478
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for coming!

162
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,477
I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like...

163
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:44,811
...I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason!

164
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:48,268
And don't even get me started on
their taste in stand-up comedy.

165
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:51,696
It's okay, Pinkie.
I figured you'd need some help.

166
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,163
That's why I stopped by.

167
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,984
Excuse me?!

168
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:57,103
Babies take a lot of work.

169
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:00,794
And some ponies are just not cut out
to handle the responsibility.

170
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,404
Is that so?

171
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:06,622
Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight.

172
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,214
Sorry, I don't have time to visit.

173
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:11,917
I'm very very busy with
my 'responsibilities' here.

174
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,518
I'm happy to help!
It's no trouble.

175
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:20,148
Well, she thinks I can't handle things on my own!

176
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:24,032
Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own.

177
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:28,769
Well, I can handle things on my own!

178
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:41,830
Pound Cake.

179
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,634
This is a crib.

180
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,470
It is only to be used for napping, sleeping...

181
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:46,690
...and on occasion with permission...

182
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,493
...as a pretend old-timey Western fort.

183
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:49,852
It is not a trampoline.

184
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:52,258
So stop your jumping right now, mister!

185
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,070
And you, young filly.

186
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,481
We do not put anything in our mouth...

187
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,783
...that we cannot safely and properly digest.

188
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:02,590
So stop slobbering on that toy, this instant!

189
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:09,753
Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon...

190
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:12,557
...and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap.

191
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:15,045
So, fall asleep!

192
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,030
Sleep tight.

193
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:39,543
Now that's what I call handling things.

194
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,258
Oh, nononono.

195
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,659
Not good, not good, not good!

196
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:55,993
Pound? Pumpkin?
Where are you?

197
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:59,418
Come out, wherever you are!

198
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:14,862
You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin...

199
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:17,914
...and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!

200
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:34,786
Pound Cake?

201
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,773
Here, Pound Cake!

202
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,271
Pound Cake?

203
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:12,084
You can fly?!

204
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:20,566
Get down here, this instant, young colt!

205
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,886
I'm responsible for you!

206
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:58,976
No no no, Pumpkin.

207
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:03,792
No no.

208
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,612
No.

209
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:11,688
I am the responsible one, and I said no.

210
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,386
That goes for you too, Pound Cake!

211
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,365
Gotcha!

212
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,230
I think?

213
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:41,882
Mhh, raspberry.

214
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:48,555
I'm not letting go!
I'm responsible!

215
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:06,767
Oh, not you too!

216
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:18,222
There!
Now who's the responsible one?

217
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:09,934
Y'know, you're right.
That is funny.

218
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,297
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

219
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,715
"I've always had fun playing with little kids..."

220
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:22,965
"...and I thought babysitting
meant just more playtime, right?"

221
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,166
"Wrong!"

222
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:27,190
"Being a caregiver is way more responsibility..."

223
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,068
"...than just being a playmate."

224
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:33,101
"And today I learned that sometimes,
our desire for responsibility..."

225
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:36,092
"...can outrun our actual ability to handle it."

226
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:38,689
Pinkie Pie!
We're back!

227
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,334
How did everything go?

228
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:46,983
Are we in the right place?

229
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,284
Shhh!

230
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,350
Pinkie!
This is just... just...

231
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:00,620
...amazing, is what it is!

232
00:21:00,621 --> 00:21:04,535
We had no idea how responsible you really are.

233
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:11,235
Would you be interested in becoming our
go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?

234
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:14,907
Let me check my schedule!

235
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:18,733
I should be available a week from... never!

236
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,846
- Pinkie...
- Pie...

237
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:31,457
I have some free time next Tuesday.
