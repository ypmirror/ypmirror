Two more minutes, Twilight?

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,085
I'm just getting to
the really good part.

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,480
The Mane-iac is about to--

5
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:17,600
The Mane-iac?

6
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,419
The Power Ponies'
most evil nemesis.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,474
She was the power-mad owner
of a hair-care product company.

8
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:26,640
A tragic accident at her shampoo
factory in Maretropolis

9
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:28,940
not only gave her mane
strange new powers,

10
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:31,305
but also caused her to go...

11
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:34,724
...completely insane!

12
00:00:34,732 --> 00:00:37,461
She and her henchponies
are planning to break into

13
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:40,724
the Maretropolis Museum
and steal the Electro-Orb

14
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,376
so she can use it to power
up her doomsday device.

15
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:45,797
Of course, the Mane-iac
wouldn't have even known

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,309
if Hum Drum hadn't slipped
up and told her all about it.

17
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:50,880
Hum Drum?

18
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:53,823
Guy in the blue boots
and pointless red cape.

19
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:57,246
The Power Ponies' bumbling
and totally useless side-kick.

20
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:59,494
The Power Ponies have
to stop the Mane-iac

21
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:02,602
or Mare-tropolis is doomed!

Mare-tropolis bakery

And I hope you realize

399
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,050
that just because we don't
always need your help,

400
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,310
it doesn't mean that we
don't think you're helpful.

401
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,880
And that you don't have
to have super powers

402
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,300
to be a super friend.

403
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,510
But I do have one question.

404
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,170
Where exactly did you
get that comic book?

405
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,080
This one I got in Canterlot at
The House of Enchanted Comics.

406
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,940
Well, I didn't know it meant
they were literally enchanted.

407
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,780
I thought it just meant like,
the comics they sold there

408
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,450
had really enchanting
story lines.

409
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,760
Hey wait up! I'm an important
part of this team; remember?
