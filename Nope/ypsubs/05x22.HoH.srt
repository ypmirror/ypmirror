I recall it being a large stick

176
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,224
that looked like a hose
that in turn did in fact

177
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:28,284
resemble a snake.

178
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:30,476
Point is WE galloped away!

179
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,580
And it chased after us!

180
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:35,248
The hose? A snake? A stick?

181
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:35,804
A snake!

182
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:36,524
A hose!

183
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:37,124
A stick!

184
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:42,076
We literally trotted for our
lives. Isn't that hilarious?

185
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,180
I guess you had to be there.

186
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,532
I DO need to be there.

187
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,656
But you weren't.

188

And it's already happened.
Oooh. Are you suggesting--

189
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,920
Time Travel?

190
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:57,944
Absolutely not! Time travel is
not something to be messed with.

191
00:09:58,092 --> 00:09:59,948
We simply need to
recreate everything

192

Oh! What a brilliant idea!

194
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:07,420
Shall we begin with the
lunch date that kicked off

195
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:10,644
the glorious weekend
you missed out on?

196

Are you sure it was this table?

197
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,748
Uh, does it really matter?

When it comes to science,
everything matters.

sat down at the table

Oh, well first, I
expressed my displeasure

of the menu and--

Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, but
I've just noticed something.

Yes?

208
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,916
The tablecloth. It
isn't the same color

209

used on the day in question.

He's right. The
tablecloth was red.

212
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:56,020
I remember because it clashed
with the font on the menus.

213

I don't suppose that
means we're gonna need

little more right.

about the rest of you,

exhaustive in our attempts

other chances for you to share

else going on here, Spike.

laugh at what happened,

Maybe it's my own
fault for staying in

350
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,304
and having a booksortacation
when I could have been

351
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,920
making jokes and memories
with my friends.

352
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:50,000
But I didn't do that,
did I? You all did.

353
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,360
You were all there but--

354
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,584
[sigh]

355
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:56,680
I wasn't there. I missed out.

356
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:00,384
And seeing you having all
these jokes I wasn't a part of

357
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:01,912
and couldn't
understand made me...

358
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,920
Jealous?

359
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:06,972
No. The Princess of
Friendship can't get jealous.

360
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:08,860
Sure you can, Twilight. And
none of us begrudge you for it.

361
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:14,492
We're sorry if we made
you feel left out.

362
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:16,808
You didn't do anything wrong.

363
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,832
You're allowed to share
things that don't include me.

364
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:23,320
And you're allowed to feel
a little jealous about it.

365
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,956
You just have to be able to
admit that's what you're feeling

366
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,328
so you can let it go.

367
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:30,832
And, you know, not try to
make us recreate everything

368
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,620
that happened when
you weren't around.

369
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,092
Of course, none of this
would have happened

370
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,472
if I hadn't encouraged everypony
not to invite you this weekend.

371
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:42,156
They wanted me to be there?

372
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,864
And you convinced
them to not invite me?

373
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:47,824
Well, I didn't think that
they should interrupt you.

374
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:53,996
But now I see that we should
have. Oh, I feel just terrible.

375
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:58,288
You don't look like
you feel terrible.

376
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:00,800
Better?

377
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:02,920
Applejack: Wait a minute.

378
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,356
You didn't suggest
not inviting Twilight

379
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:08,400
cause you wanted to make
her feel left out, did you?

380
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:09,408
Of course not!

381
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,680
That whole jealousy thing
was just a happy accident.

382
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,804
Certainly we can all agree
that Princess Twilight

383
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,776
learned a valuable lesson here.

384
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:21,840
That even she can have
feelings of jealousy.

385
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:24,556
That she should
recognize said feelings

386
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:28,280
rather than try to pretend
that she doesn't have them?

387
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:31,920
Did I get the tiniest bit
of glee out of watching her

388
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:35,336
try to recreate our weekend of
fun in the name of "science"?

389
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:38,888
Oh, most definitely.

390
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:43,612
But what's important here is
that it was never my intent

391
00:19:43,664 --> 00:19:45,096
to make Twilight feel jealous.

392
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,684
That's something the old
me would have tried to do.

393
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,804
Orange you glad I've changed?

394
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,636
I said "Orange you
glad I've changed?"

395
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:06,048
[cough]

396
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:09,644
Orange! Like the ones
at the Applejack farm.

397
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:11,568
From this weekend.

398
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:16,192
No? Nothing? Really?

399
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,272
I thought you'd find
this hisss-sterical.

400
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,072
[rattle]

401
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:26,884
Yes, no. Discord, I think these
jokes have run their course.

402
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,064
Only way we'd find
them funny now is

403
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:31,304
if you put us all under
some kind of spell.

404
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:34,644
Come on! You'd have to
be a complete crazy pony

405
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,240
to think he'd do
something like that.

406
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,148
What are you going
to say next, Pinkie?

407
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:41,068
That we'd all have to drink some
weird potion to break the spell?

408
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:43,796
[laughter]

409
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,868
What's so funny?

410
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:50,920
Come on, Discord, do we really
have to spell it out for you?

411
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:56,584
[laughter]

412
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:57,940
I don't get it.

413
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,668
Somepony want to tell me
what's so hilarious? Anypony?

414
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:08,396
Hello? I'm talking to
you! You and you, you!

415
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,184
Well, what's funny about spells?

416
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:16,328
I don't get it; I feel left out
and I feel really bad about it.

417
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,348
Sorry, buddy. Guess
you had to be there.

418
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,004
[POOF]

419
00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:30,848
[laughter]
