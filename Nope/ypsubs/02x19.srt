1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,350
Lunch time!

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,250
Who's hungry?

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,951
Plenty for everypony.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,214
Slow down, sweetie.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,860
Here you go, Angel bunny.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,631
Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win.

7
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:34,638
Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum yum yum!

8
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,043
What? But--

9
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:43,910
Then, what will you eat?

10
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:50,445
I'm not sure I can even make that.

11
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:54,500
Well, I don't want you to starve...

12
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,913
Are you sure I can't tempt you
with a nice crisp piece of--

13
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:01,909
I'll make your special recipe.

17
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:43,950
Hmm, let's see.
Asparagus.

18
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:53,065
Excuse me... I think you just
stepped in front of me...?

19
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,246
Excuse me, I think you made a mistake?

20
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:57,247
You see I was actually here first and--

21
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:59,136
Sorry, didn't notice you there.

22
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:01,155
I know.

23
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:04,267
Pardon me, sir.

24
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:06,042
Yes, what?

25
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:08,253
I think you just cut in front of me.

26
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:12,190
A cut of celery?
But, this is the asparagus stand!

27
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:16,086
I said, I think you just cut
in front of me.

28
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,773
No need, dearie, I'm already in front!

29
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:21,853
I noticed.

30
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:23,392
Hey!

31
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:26,134
Would you mind moving back?
You're in my personal space.

32
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:28,575
But--

33
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:30,833
Seriously, do you need
your asparagus so badly?

34
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,876
Get a life.

35
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:35,197
Oh, okay. There's no rush.

36
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,756
Fluttershy!

37
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,276
You mustn't let them treat you that way.

38
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,626
It's really no big deal...

39
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:44,227
It's bigger than big, it's double big.

40
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:46,476
You are a pony with a problem.

41
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:47,777
What problem?

42
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:55,045
Go right ahead Pinkie Pie, you first.

43
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:57,398
Right there! That's the problem.

44
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,816
You've got to stop being such a doormat.

45
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,525
A doormat?

46
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:03,905
A pushover, darling.

47
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:05,879
You've got to stand up for yourself.

48
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:06,780
Promise us.

49
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:09,286
Okay. I promise.

50
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,487
Oh, good!

51
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:14,430
That's okay, I don't mind.

52
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:16,262
Watch and learn.

53
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:17,186
Hold it right there,

54
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,994
mister small and handsome!

55
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:20,996
Who, me?

56
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,634
Of course, you.

57
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,526
Nopony ever called you handsome before?

58
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,590
That'd be a big no.

59
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,905
Well they should!

60
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:32,807
How about flexing
some of your muscles for me?

61
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:36,702
Oh my heavens!

62
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:40,614
Do you think a strong, handsome stallion
such as yourself

63
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,936
could give my friend the last asparagus?

64
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,531
See, that's not so hard, is it?

65
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,955
I guess not...

66
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,653
Alright then! What else is on your list?

67
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:56,683
Let's see... I also need tomatoes.

68
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:00,196
Here you go.

69
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:04,434
That'll be two bits. Not one.

70
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:06,565
But last week it was only one bit.

71
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:08,206
That was then, this is now.

72
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:09,479
Okay.

73
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,315
I don't wanna argue about it.

74
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:13,023
What do you think you're doing?

75
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:15,744
Mindin' my own business,
maybe you should try it.

76
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:17,556
Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous.

77
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:19,459
One bit is the right price.

78
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,382
I say it's two bits.

79
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:23,421
One bit.

80
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:24,920
Two bits!

81
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:25,921
One bit!

82
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:27,743
- Two bits!
- One bit!

83
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:28,744
Two bits!

84
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,520
- Two bits!
- One bit!

85
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,921
- Two bits!
- One bit!

86
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:34,076
I insist, it's two bits or nothing!

87
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:36,079
One bit and that's my final offer!

88
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,486
Have it your way, one bit it is!

89
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,588
See? Asserting yourself can be fun!

90
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,139
I guess you're right!

91
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,129
So, Fluttershy,
do you feel like giving it a try?

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,962
Um... okay.

93
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,786
I need that cherry.

94
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:56,576
Am I glad you have one cherry left.

95
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:59,145
You see, I'm making this special meal
for my bunny Angel

96
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:02,464
he's a very picky eater,
and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.

97
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:04,454
Here you go.

98
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:05,728
So,

99
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,580
you say you need
this cherry very badly.

100
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:10,949
Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,476
Then it'll be ten bits!

102
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:13,777
Ten?!

103
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:19,828
Oh, hey, mister handsome.

104
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,956
I know you wanna do the right thing,
because you're handsome and strong

105
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:27,069
and big, handsome, strong guys
are always nice to everypony, right?

106
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,056
Ten bits for the cherry.

107
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,256
Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous!

108
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:38,426
I insist on paying you... eleven bits!

109
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:39,477
Eleven bits?

110
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:41,206
I mean, nine bits!

111
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:42,636
Now wait a minute...

112
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:45,479
Okay, twelve bits,
but that's my final offer!

113
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:47,076
I think you're confused.

114
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,238
It's twelve bits, take it or leave it.

115
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,590
Okay, I'll take it.

116
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,076
Don't give him your money!

117
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,373
One cherry is not worth twelve bits!

118
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:56,966
But... I was only doing what you did.

119
00:05:57,117 --> 00:05:59,606
It was a valiant effort,
but you should refuse to give him

120
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:01,376
your business and just walk away.

121
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,696
But... I can't let Angel starve!

122
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:06,426
He won't eat it unless
I make it just right!

123
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:09,086
I need that cherry
no matter what it costs!

124
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:11,526
In that case, twenty bits!

125
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:15,546
Twenty?!
Oh, but I don't have that much.

126
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:17,376
Then why're you wasting my time?

127
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,166
I'll give you two bits for that cherry!

128
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:19,867
Sold!

129
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:23,226
That's a break, kid.
Next time, don't be such a doormat.

130
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,005
Here you go, Angel.

131
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:34,976
Sorry there's no cherry on top,

132
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:37,376
but the rest of it is exactly
what you wanted.

133
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:40,249
Angel?

134
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:47,476
Look at me... I really am a doormat.

135
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:50,596
The incredible Iron Will

136
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,145
turns doormats into dynamos.

137
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:56,155
Assertiveness seminar today,
hedge maze centre.

138
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,101
As Celestia is my witness,

139
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:03,230
I'm never gonna be a pushover again!

140
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,888
Excuse me!

141
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:52,988
Welcome, friends! My name is Iron Will.

142
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,306
And today is the first day
of your new life!

143
00:07:56,447 --> 00:08:00,134
I wanna hear you stomp
if you're tired of being a pushover!

144
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:06,688
Stomp if you're tired of being a doormat!

145
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:12,059
Stomp if you wanna pay nothing
for this seminar!

146
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,220
That's no joke, friends.

147
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:27,338
Iron Will is so confident that you will be
one hundred percent satisfied

148
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,822
with Iron Will's assertiveness techniques,

149
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:35,140
that if you are not one hundred percent
satisfied, you... pay... nothing.

150
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:38,738
But I pity the fool who doubts
Iron Will's methods.

151
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:40,339
You don't doubt me, do you?

152
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:42,668
Uh-uh, no sir...

153
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:45,234
That, my friends, is your first lesson.

154
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:48,068
"Don't be shy, look 'em in the eye."

155
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,609
Now, to demonstrate that

156
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:55,284
Iron Will's techniques
will work for anypony,

157
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,488
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

158
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,428
You, in the back row!

159
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,621
Who, me?

160
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:15,458
Yes, you! Iron Will wants you onstage!

161
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,648
Uh, well...

162
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:19,048
Now!

163
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,449
Okay...

164
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,938
He’s blocking your path.

165
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:31,310
What are you gonna do about it?

166
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,452
Um, politely walk around him?

167
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:34,483
No.

168
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:36,291
Gingerly tip-toe around him?

169
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:37,288
No.

170
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,829
Go back home, and try again tomorrow?

171
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,830
No!

172
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:44,179
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

173
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:48,936
Oh! Sorry.

174
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,058
Don’t be sorry, be assertive!

175
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:54,638
"Never apologize, when you can criticize."

176
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:57,750
Why don’t you watch where you’re going!?

177
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,251
Now, you try.

178
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:06,868
Next time, get out of the way before...
I bump into you.

179
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:11,534
Because...
I totally won’t be sorry when I do!

180
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:15,664
You see my friends!?

181
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:18,338
If my techniques can work
for this shy, little pony,

182
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:21,525
then they can work for anypony!

183
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,688
Okay, I feel good.

184
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:31,538
I feel ready to "attack the day",

185
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:32,882
as Iron Will says.

186
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:39,108
Excuse me, Mr. Greenhooves,

187
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,701
but I think you might be
over-watering my petunias...

188
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:43,902
again...

189
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,285
Let the professional handle it.

190
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:54,064
"Treat me like a pushover,
and you'll get the once over."

191
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,893
Perhaps that is enough water.

192
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:07,994
Thank you.

193
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,504
I can't believe it worked!

194
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,238
Showpony business is tough.

195
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,014
Go ahead, try one of your jokes out on me.

196
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,315
I laugh at everything.

197
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:20,316
Okay, okay, okay.

198
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:24,316
A donkey and a mule
are stuck on a desert island...

199
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:26,208
Excuse me?

200
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,438
Would you mind moving your carts,
so I can pass?

201
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,908
Yeah yeah, in a minute,
I just wanna finish up this story.

202
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,594
And so the donkey says to the mule--

203
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:37,148
Can you move, you're blocking my path.

204
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:40,146
Yeah yeah, in a minute!
So the donkey says to the mule...

205
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:43,718
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

206
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,138
Easy does it, lady. We're moving, okay?

207
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:53,339
Good!

208
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,339
Who's next, please, and what

209
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:00,740
can I get for you today?

210
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:03,667
What do you think you're doing?

211
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:04,868
Didn't you see me?

212
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,608
Uh, I guess maybe.

213
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,482
"Maybe"?
"Maybes are for babies!"

214
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,568
Now go to the back of the line,

215
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:14,128
where you belong!

216
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,439
Hey, look at you!

217
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:26,369
Your attitude is so feisty.

218
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,770
It's fabulous.

219
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:30,012
Looks like that monster's workshop
really paid off!

220
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,894
Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur.

221
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,922
And a true inspiration.

222
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:36,442
His techniques really work.

223
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:39,703
Well, they've certainly made a difference
in the way you carry yourself.

224
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:42,273
You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.

225
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:45,188
Yes, I am.
And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked

226
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,042
about new Fluttershy.

227
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:49,966
Well, old Pinkie Pie feels
really proud of new Fluttershy.

228
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,109
Proud as pink punch.

229
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:53,854
Want some?

230
00:12:57,211 --> 00:13:00,818
"You laugh at me, I wrath at you!"

231
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,383
Bye, girls.

232
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,004
What a day.

233
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:10,558
Taxi!

234
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:16,396
Oh no you don't.

235
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,886
"Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!"

236
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,335
Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around!

237
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:28,487
NOPONY!

238
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,993
Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure

239
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:35,102
new Fluttershy is such
a good idea after all.

240
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:36,987
Old Rarity agrees.

241
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,592
You got this, new Fluttershy!

242
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:43,379
This day is yours!

243
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:45,489
And nopony's gonna take it away from you!

244
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:48,189
Am I right?!

245
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:49,762
Right!

246
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:54,772
What?! He's delivered
the wrong mail, again!

247
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,313
And new Fluttershy does not want
the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.

248
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:06,958
Did I mix them up again?

249
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,822
Sorry about that.

250
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:12,016
"You apologize, I penalize!"

251
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:25,326
Excuse me, do you know how
to get to the Ponyville tower?

252
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:26,993
Sure, you just--

253
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,826
That's a shame.

254
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:35,796
"You make me lose, I blow my fuse!"

255
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:43,282
Fluttershy! What are you doing?!

256
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:45,038
That's no way to behave.

257
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,467
Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy?

258
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:50,522
And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!

259
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:54,276
No, sweetie, he didn't.
We saw the whole thing.

260
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:57,077
We think that you've taken
your assertiveness training

261
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:58,378
a little too far.

262
00:14:58,982 --> 00:14:59,679
What?!

263
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:03,622
You just want new Fluttershy
to be a doormat like old Fluttershy!

264
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:06,565
But old Fluttershy is GONE!

265
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:09,518
New Fluttershy... old Fluttershy...!?

266
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,766
What happened to nice Fluttershy?

267
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,246
We want that Fluttershy back.

268
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:17,782
No, you want wimp Fluttershy.
You want pushover Fluttershy.

269
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:21,422
You want do-anything-to-her
and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!

270
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:26,052
Too many Fluttershies to keep track of!
Make it stop!

271
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:29,813
Things getting too complicated for
your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?

272
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,122
Now, stop right there!

273
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,932
Let's not let things descend
into petty insults!

274
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,622
Why not? I thought "petty"
was what you're all about, Rarity.

275
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:41,742
With your "petty" concerns about fashion.

276
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:46,195
Hey, leave her alone!
Fashion is her passion!

277
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,649
Oh, and what are you passionate about?
Birthday cake? Party hats?

278
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:53,796
I can't believe that the two most
frivolous ponies in Ponyville

279
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:56,604
are trying to tell new Fluttershy
how to live her life

280
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:59,772
when they are throwing their own lives
away on pointless pursuits,

281
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:03,105
that nopony else gives
a flying feather about!

282
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,301
Looks like nasty Fluttershy
is here to stay!

283
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:12,153
I cannot believe what that monster,
Iron Will, has done to you!

284
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:18,969
Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!

285
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,066
...I'm the monster.

286
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,550
Fluttershy, are you in there?

287
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,767
It's Pinkie Pie, and Rarity!

288
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,813
Go away! Go away before
nasty Fluttershy strikes again!

289
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:52,074
Oh, sweetie,
we all said things that we regret.

290
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:53,175
We did?

291
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:56,022
Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame.

292
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,322
But don't worry, I'm never
coming out of my house again.

293
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:03,760
Everypony will be a lot safer with me
and my mean mouth locked away.

294
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,750
Sweetie,

295
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,727
Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you,
nor do I.

296
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:10,762
You just received some bad advice
from that Iron Will character.

297
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:14,430
Yeah! He's the one that
made you act super-duper nasty.

298
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:16,217
What I mean is,

299
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:19,872
there are other ways to assert yourself
besides yelling at everypony.

300
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:20,445
Yes!

301
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:24,088
You can stand up for yourself
without being unpleasant about it.

302
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:26,322
I'm not sure I can.

303
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:27,923
I'm too far gone.

304
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:29,189
Whenever I try to assert myself,

305
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,975
I become a monster.

306
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:35,792
Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.

307
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:37,098
No, but he is.

308
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:41,993
Iron Will's my name,
training ponies is my game.

309
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:46,249
What a darling little catchphrase.

310
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,518
Your friend Fluttershy loved
Iron Will's catchphrases.

311
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:53,056
Word on the street is that
she doesn't take no duff from nopony!

312
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:57,114
So, Iron Will is here
to collect Iron Will's fee.

313
00:17:57,265 --> 00:18:00,099
Fluttershy's in no shape
to deal with that creep!

314
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,772
I'm sure a big, brave,
powerful and rich monster--

315
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:07,344
I mean, minotaur, like you,

316
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:09,431
doesn't need that money right away.

317
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,876
You can afford to come back later.

318
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:13,562
Are you kidding?
Fluttershy is overdue as it is.

319
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,897
Iron Will collects now.

320
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,568
Do something!

321
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:22,692
We're not even sure
Fluttershy is home right now.

322
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:25,409
She might be off frolicking
with some woodland creatures.

323
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,535
Why don't you give us some time
to track her down for ya?

324
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,712
Iron Will does have some
grocery shopping to do.

325
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,907
Iron Will will come back this afternoon.

326
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:36,522
But that's only half a day.

327
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:38,572
We need one full day at least.

328
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:41,700
Iron Will will delay for half a day
and no longer!

329
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,721
A full day!

330
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:43,722
Half day!

331
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:44,423
Full day!

332
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:45,424
Half day!

333
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:46,425
Half day!

334
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:47,372
Full day!

335
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:49,822
We need half a day and no more!

336
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:52,318
You'll get a full day and no less!

337
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,393
Okie dokie. See you tomorrow.

338
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:55,294
Wait, what?

339
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:59,873
Sounds like the search
won't be necessary.

340
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,435
Iron Will collects now.

341
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:05,431
But we had an agreement!
You gotta come back tomorrow!

342
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:09,542
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

343
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:17,529
Your payment is overdue, Fluttershy!

344
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,690
You were nothing but a doormat!

345
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:31,888
And Iron Will turned you into a lean,
mean, assertive machine!

346
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:36,562
Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will!

347
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:38,859
Um, no.

348
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,639
What did you say?

349
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,640
No.

350
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:47,556
I'd hate to be you right now.

351
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:50,758
Because Iron Will is gonna
rain down a world of hurt

352
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:54,285
unless Iron Will gets his money pronto!

353
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:58,251
As I recall, during your workshop,
you promised

354
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:00,553
one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed

355
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:01,594
or you pay nothing.

356
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,842
Well, I'm not satisfied.

357
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:05,872
What do you mean, you're not satisfied?!

358
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:08,422
Everypony has always been satisfied!

359
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:10,327
Well I guess I'm the first then.

360
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:11,420
But since I'm not satisfied,

361
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,800
I refuse to pay.

362
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,927
It's as simple as that.

363
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:26,372
Are you sure you're not
just a little bit satisfied?

364
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,525
Because maybe... we could, cut a deal...

365
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:31,400
I mean, we're both reasonable creatures,
aren't we?

366
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,437
I'm sorry, but no means no.

367
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:36,515
No means no, huh?

368
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,847
Nopony's ever said that to me before.

369
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:40,998
I gotta remember that one.

370
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:44,042
That's a good catchphrase
for my next workshop.

371
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:47,022
You're amazing, Fluttershy!

372
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,152
You totally stood up to that monster!

373
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:50,664
In fact, you didn't change at all!

374
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:54,154
You were the same old Fluttershy
that we've always loved!

375
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:55,959
The one we missed!

376
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,568
Don't worry,
old Fluttershy's back for good.

377
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:01,649
I'm sorry I took the whole
assertiveness thing too far.

378
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,950
Friends?

379
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:06,512
Friends!

380
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:10,049
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

381
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,215
<i>Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony
like me to stand up for myself.</i>

382
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:15,464
<i>And when I first tried it,</i>

383
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,322
<i>I didn't like the pony I became.</i>

384
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,310
<i>But I've learned that standing up
for yourself isn't the same</i>

385
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,124
<i>as changing who you are.</i>

386
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:27,092
<i>Now I know how to put my hoof down,
without being unpleasant, or mean.</i>
