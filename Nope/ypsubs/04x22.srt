1
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:06,495
<i>Yes!</i>

2
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:08,052
<i>Best day ever!</i>

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:11,443
<i>We're all going to the Rainbow</i>
<i>Falls Traders Exchange.</i>

4
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:16,146
And not just going.

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,974
We're accompanying a princess
on an official royal duty.

6
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:22,645
Please. It's not that
big of a deal.

7
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:25,713
There always has to be a
princess at the Exchange.

8
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:27,687
Last year it was
Princess Cadance.

9
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:28,901
This year it's me.

10
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:30,624
It's just a formality.

11
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,347
I'm sure none of
the other ponies

12
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:33,652
will even notice I'm here.

13
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:34,946
<i>Look over there!</i>

14
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:36,148
<i>The Princess!</i>

15
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:38,076
<i>This is amazing!</i>

16
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,794
Could be wrong, but I think
they might've noticed.

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,350
<i>Subtitles by YayPonies
http://yayponies.eu</i>

18
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,952
Oh my goodness!

19
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:29,951
<i>You said it!</i>

20
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:32,967
The Rainbow Falls Traders
Exchange is simply divine.

21
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:35,123
You can get anything
you want here.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,449
If'n you got the
goods to trade for it.

23
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:41,471
Whoa!

24
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,416
No!

25
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:46,950
Thanks, Twilight. Phew!

26
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:50,357
One ding, nick or dent and this
Power Ponies comic book

27
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,279
wouldn't be in perfect mint
condition anymore.

28
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:54,819
And if you want to
trade for a mint comic,

29
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,663
you've gotta have a mint comic.

30
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:05,143
I guess a pony who's here on
official princess business

31
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,681
has to expect a little fussin'.

32
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,160
But all I'm supposed to do
is settle disagreements

33
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,974
over whether a trade
is fair or not.

34
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:13,871
<i>And since the rule is</i>
<i>that a trade is fair</i>

35
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,683
<i>as long as both ponies</i>
<i>get what they want,</i>

36
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:17,393
<i>there's never been a</i>
<i>disagreement.</i>

37
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,514
So there's really no
reason for anypony

38
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,120
to treat me as
anything special.

39
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,200
Hi, can I help you?

40
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,106
There's a pony here who's got
a signed, first edition

41
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:33,545
of Daring Do and the Quest
of the Sapphire Statue.

42
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,112
And I'm gonna get it!

43
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,201
I've been able to get first
editions of all the

44
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:39,057
Daring Do books except this one.

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,281
No pony's ever put
together a whole set.

46
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,237
And I'm gonna be the first!

47
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:44,928
If it hasn't been traded yet.

48
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:46,913
It's the only one
in all of Equestria.

49
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:50,620
Oh no! I'd really hate to
see you disappointed.

50
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,092
<i>I did want to trade this</i>
<i>bear call I brought</i>

51
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:54,485
<i>for a bird whistle.</i>

52
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,235
But getting that book
seems so important to you.

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,447
So if you need me
to help you first...

54
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,309
Normally, I'd say I
don't need any help.

55
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,719
But you're right: This
is really important.

56
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,410
I've gotta get that book!

57
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,800
Well, I'm off to take a gander
at some of the vintage stalls.

58
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,726
Did you say vintage?

59
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:16,829
Why, old and rare items
are so in style right now.

60
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:19,036
I'm hoping to get a
vintage item as well.

61
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,912
I just hope I brought
enough to trade.

62
00:03:22,187 --> 00:03:23,607
I know what you mean, Rarity.

63
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:27,615
Hey, why don't we pool
our trade stashes?

64
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:28,536
Pool?

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,231
That way, if one of us finds
something real valuable

66
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,497
she can't live without...

67
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,761
She'll definitely
be able to get it.

68
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:38,491
Who could say no to
exchanging a single object

69
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,400
for such a huge
assortment of items?

70
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:43,313
Oh, yes, that is
absolutely brilliant.

71
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,070
I'm so glad I have a
friend like you, Applejack.

72
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,935
I feel the same way.

73
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,729
Then let's go shopping!

74
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,799
Um, shouldn't Your
Princessness be heading

75
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,211
to the royal box seats?

76
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:02,702
I may be the princess on duty,
but I don't think that means

77
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:04,971
I have to sit up there
all alone doing nothing.

78
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:08,197
Ever since I became a princess,
Celestia has been sending me

79
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,639
more books to read than ever.

80
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,309
<i>The library is overflowing.</i>

81
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,006
So I figured
while we're here.

82
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,719
I might as well trade away some
books I don't need any more.

83
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,860
Mm hm!

84
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:21,693
There it is!

85
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:24,800
The first edition of Daring
Do and the Sapphire Statue!

86
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,643
It hasn't been traded yet!

87
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,400
Lucky for you.

88
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:30,995
Because I've brought my
most valuable possession

89
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,247
to trade for it:

90
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,449
<i>My lucky horse shoe.</i>

91
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't want it.

92
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:38,932
What?

93
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,149
It's just a rusty
old horse shoe.

94
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:43,121
That's not worth
anything to me.

95
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:47,904
But how is Rainbow Dash going to
get the book she really wants?

96
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,732
Well, she's not.

97
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,511
Unless ...

98
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:54,958
she can get me that.

99
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:01,449
Ooh, an Orthros.

100
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,852
<i>How cute.</i>

101
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,138
The pony running the
Ancient Beast Stall

102
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:07,822
doesn't want
anything I got.

103
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,985
But if you can get
me the Orthros,

104
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:13,200
I'll trade you
the book for it.

105
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,099
You got it!

106
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:21,504
I don't know how, but somehow
we're gonna get that Orthros.

107
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:28,476
Oh, Applejack!

108
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,333
I am so glad I found you.

109
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,372
Me, too. You're not
gonna believe it.

110
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,131
I found a super valuable vintage
item I just have to have.

111
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:36,993
And all it's going to
cost is all our stuff!

112
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,718
Uh-oh.

113
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:44,749
So where is this
valuable vintage item

114
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:47,129
you want to trade
everything we have for?

115
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:48,405
There.

116
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:51,004
Where?

117
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:52,064
Right there.

118
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,093
But that's a dented
old pie tin.

119
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:58,534
A dented vintage pie tin.

120
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,295
The metal they used to fashion
this one helps cook the pies

121
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:03,100
up to five seconds faster.

122
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:05,024
<i>They don't make 'em</i>
<i>like this anymore.</i>

123
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:08,595
I am so glad you showed
that to me, darling.

124
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:11,440
Because once you
see what I found,

125
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,898
you won't want to waste
our trade goods on that.

126
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:18,158
<i>Just look at this</i>
<i>gorgeous vintage brooch.</i>

127
00:06:18,398 --> 00:06:19,879
It's one of a kind.

128
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:24,837
It looks exactly like the
one you're already wearing.

129
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:27,079
Well, yes, they
may look the same.

130
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,323
But I know it's older.

131
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,505
That's what makes it
so much more divine.

132
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,690
But that doesn't
make a lick of sense.

133
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,739
Why I wager if I
switched 'em up,

134
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,540
you wouldn't even
know the difference.

135
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,600
Oh, don't be silly;
of course I would.

136
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,759
So which is the vintage one?

137
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,756
That one, of course.

138
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:54,156
Ha! You're bluffin'.

139
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:55,471
Am I?

140
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:56,762
How can you tell?

141
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:58,487
Well, because...

142
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,427
Agh! I can't.

143
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:02,710
'Cause the one you want to
waste our whole stash on

144
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:05,028
is exactly the same as
the one you already got.

145
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:07,477
There's no way anypony
would notice the difference.

146
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:10,954
I'd say it's a lot more
likely they'd notice that

147
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,186
than some dented tin
that cooked a pie

148
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,278
a whole two
seconds faster.

149
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,668
It's five
seconds faster!

150
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:39,508
Yes, such a good
two-headed boy.

151
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:40,760
Yes you are.

152
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:43,754
Stop that!

153
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:45,970
Come on! Don't you
start now, too.

154
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:52,411
OK, I can see you're busy, so
I'll give it to you straight.

155
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:55,406
I need to trade this
horse shoe for ...that.

156
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,336
Nope.

157
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:00,544
Down boy!

158
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:01,750
Watch out for the lamp.

159
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,853
Well, I could use
another lamp.

160
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,726
<i>A whole stand filled with</i>
<i>Discord-shaped lamps?</i>

161
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,235
Seriously?

162
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:19,137
They really do have everything
at the Traders Exchange.

163
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,098
Will you trade a lamp
for my horse shoe,

164
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,960
so I can trade it for an
Orthros and get my book?

165
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:24,212
No.

166
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,701
But I'd trade it for
an antique chicken.

167
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,710
Great!

168
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,898
What's an antique chicken?

169
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:36,374
Oh, I got all kinds of
antique chicken statues:

170
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,711
I got your Blue Hens,
Speckled Greys, your...

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,417
OK, cool.

172
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,241
So will you trade
one for a horse shoe,

173
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,349
so I can trade it for a lamp and
<i>then trade it for an Orthros</i>

174
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,514
<i>so I can get my book?</i>

175
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:48,934
Well, let me think.

176
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:50,640
Uh, no.

177
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,775
But I'd gladly trade one of my
chickens for a crystal chalice.

178
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:00,033
Hang on a sec.

179
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,346
<i>We need a crystal chalice</i>
<i>to trade for a chicken</i>

180
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:05,313
<i>to trade for a lamp to</i>
<i>trade for an Orthros.</i>

181
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,598
So what are you
willing to trade for?

182
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,986
I'm guessing it's gotta
be some crazy thing

183
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:11,880
way across the Exchange.

184
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:15,342
Actually, I could use a
slightly rusty old horse shoe.

185
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:18,571
Yeah, but where am
I gonna find...wait!

186
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:19,935
I've got one of those!

187
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,407
Now that we've got the chalice,
this is gonna be a cinch.

188
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:25,640
Do you really think so?

189
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,062
All we gotta do is bring this
thing to the chicken stand

190
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,055
and we are--

191
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:37,779
You want me to trade all
my books for a broken pen?

192
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,460
All right fine, you got
yourself a dea--

193
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,974
Stop! What are you doing?

194
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:47,336
I was trying to get rid of all
the books I don't need anymore.

195
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,421
For that?

196
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:51,619
Do you really want that?

197
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,074
Well, not really.

198
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,526
But I'm running out of
library space, so-

199
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,949
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!

200
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,172
I can't believe that
almost happened.

201
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,940
But luckily it didn't happen.

202
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:01,699
Thanks to me.

203
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:02,950
What are you talking about?

204
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,381
According to the
rules of the Exchange,

205
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:07,309
a trade is only fair
if both ponies end up

206
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,370
with something they want.

207
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:10,540
You can't break
the rules.

208
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,604
Did anypony see you do it?

209
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:13,644
I don't think anypony saw.

210
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,167
But you're not going to
say anything, are you?

211
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:19,342
Just kidding.

212
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,234
Or am I?

213
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:21,637
Sometimes I can't
even tell...

214
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,600
You know, if you
want to go check out

215
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,080
the rest of the Exchange and
trade whatever you brought...

216
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,452
Nope. I just came
to pony watch.

217
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,058
I'm not going anywhere.

218
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,216
I won't let you make a
mistake like that again.

219
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,394
Hey, Everypony!

220
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,260
Step right up.

221
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:40,206
Do not walk.

222
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,324
Gallop over here for your
chance to trade for authentic,

223
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:46,413
one-of-a-kind, official
princess merchandise!

224
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,630
Well, that took forever.

225
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:56,630
I just hope it looks OK.

226
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,319
This is perfect!

227
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:09,028
Perfect for the broken
chalice mosaic I'm making.

228
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,296
All right, so what kind of
antique chicken do you want?

229
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,942
<i>I got speckled, brown, grey...</i>

230
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:15,625
Oh, no!

231
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,824
The pony we're supposed to
trade the chicken statue to

232
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,274
didn't tell us what
kind he wanted.

233
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,340
OK, look, I'm fast.

234
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,262
I'll fly over to the
lamp stand and find out

235
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:24,218
what kind of
chicken he wants.

236
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,279
Just don't let anypony trade for
any chicken while I'm gone, OK?

237
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:30,538
Um, well, OK.

238
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:31,951
Um, I can do that.

239
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:32,696
I think.

240
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:39,157
Uh, well, maybe you
shouldn't get one of those.

241
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:43,157
You know, unless
you really want to.

242
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,594
Beat it!

243
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,243
You go.

244
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:53,096
I'll stay here.

245
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,412
Well, since we can't
both get what we want,

246
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:58,958
I will be the
better friend.

247
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:01,791
You take our trade goods
and get what you want.

248
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:03,553
I'm an amazin' friend.

249
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:06,005
So even though it's fer
somethin' that don't seem

250
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,532
valuable at all,
you take our stash.

251
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,575
How dare you let
me get what I want?

252
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,530
What kind of friend
do you think I am?

253
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,444
You're going to
get what you want.

254
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:15,644
No, you are.

255
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,815
No, you are.

256
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:20,999
Hello?

257
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:25,239
We got the kind of
chicken you asked for.

258
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:26,257
<i>Hello?</i>

259
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,375
<i>Where's the pony</i>
<i>running this joint?</i>

260
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,479
On break?

261
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:37,970
These books made Twilight
the princess she is.

262
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,990
Before that, she was nothing.

263
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,079
Big fat zero.

264
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:41,763
Hey!

265
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:44,111
Then she read these
books and voila!

266
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,707
Princess!

267
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:48,037
So who wants to
start the bidding?

268
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:48,858
Me!

269
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:50,653
Me first!

270
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,539
Just a moment, please.

271
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:57,112
Pinkie, I appreciate
your help and all.

272
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:59,252
But I'm not sure I'm
comfortable with this.

273
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,065
No pony should
trade for my books

274
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:02,538
just because I'm a princess.

275
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,819
<i>I'm not better</i>
<i>than anypony else.</i>

276
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:08,444
I know you're not
better than everypony.

277
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:09,836
Just leave this to me.

278
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:13,293
Did I mention that Princess
Twilight got these books

279
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:15,959
from Princess Celestia?

280
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,309
Whoa, wait!

281
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,359
You don't mean?

282
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:22,117
Oh, that's right:
double Princess.

283
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,385
There he is!

284
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,020
Look, I know it's
your break and all,

285
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:38,419
but you've got to
open your stand

286
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:39,748
so we can trade
you for a lamp.

287
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,539
Sorry, girls.

288
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,786
Been trading all day.

289
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:47,588
My belly's telling me it's
time to eat an oat burger.

290
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:49,400
Oh, come on.

291
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:50,899
Please?

292
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,425
Pretty, pretty please?

293
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,489
Sorry. Belly
says "no."

294
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,146
But the Exchange
ends at sundown.

295
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:01,346
No!

296
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,040
I've got an idea.

297
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:14,439
Next.

298
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:26,140
Next!

299
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:28,005
Next!

300
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:29,880
Next!

301
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:31,668
Next!

302
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,731
We're home free!

303
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,271
As long as this thing
doesn't drown us in slobber.

304
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:51,763
Oh, he's just an affectionate
little two-headed fellow,

305
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:53,285
aren't you, little boy?

306
00:14:57,408 --> 00:15:00,476
No, I insist you go
fetch what you want.

307
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,849
Cause that's the kind of
tried-and-true friend I am.

308
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,522
Well! I am way too generous to
let you out-friend me like that.

309
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:18,304
We've got to hurry.

310
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,715
We're never going to get
to the Daring Do stand

311
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:34,995
through this crowd in time.

312
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:46,739
Come on!

313
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,584
My bear call.

314
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:54,156
We've got to go.

315
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:56,641
Of course.

316
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:57,945
It's just a bear call.

317
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,841
There's nothing I
could've traded it for

318
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:02,021
that's more valuable
to me than you.

319
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:10,039
OK, the Exchange is almost
over, but we did it.

320
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:13,363
We traded a crystal chalice
for an antique chicken.

321
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:15,172
And the chicken for a lamp.

322
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:18,872
And the lamp for an Orthros,
just like you asked.

323
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:21,531
So here you go.

324
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:22,839
Now where's my book?

325
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:29,149
Yeah, you know, the thing is, I
don't want an Orthros anymore.

326
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:31,859
But...

327
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:33,886
What do we do now?

328
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:43,789
Oh goodness.
Oh goodness!

329
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:45,270
Agh!

330
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:48,858
Good boys.

331
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:52,160
Hey! You said you
wanted an Orthros!

332
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:55,248
I've been watching that thing
over in the Ancient Beast Booth.

333
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:58,565
It's crazy. I don't
want one in my house.

334
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:02,778
There, there; that's
a good Orthros.

335
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:04,782
You just have to know
how to treat them.

336
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:07,744
With a little patient training
and a big slobber mop,

337
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:10,240
they can be a wonderful
household pet.

338
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,458
All right, all right.

339
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:17,812
I'll trade you.

340
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:20,755
Yes!

341
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,184
<i>If she comes and stays</i>
<i>with us in Manehattan</i>

342
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,419
<i>until it's trained.</i>

343
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:31,873
Gosh. Training an Orthros
takes a long time.

344
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,466
I'll probably be gone
from Ponyville for...

345
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,778
I don't even know
how many moons.

346
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:42,466
But if that is what
you really want.

347
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:44,277
So we got a fair deal?

348
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,761
Of course, it's a deal!

349
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,790
Yeah ha ha!

350
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,488
I did it! I did it!

351
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,039
Fluttershy, can you
believe it?

352
00:17:58,985 --> 00:17:59,795
Oh, no!

353
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:01,840
What did I do?

354
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,751
<i>Who's got something</i>
<i>valuable enough to trade</i>

355
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,172
for Princess Twilight's
princess books

356
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:09,313
that she got from
Princess Celestia?

357
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,376
Did I say princess?

358
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,331
Over here,
over here!

359
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,569
Oh, come on.

360
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,338
These are the books the princess
would sit up with all night,

361
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:20,766
with nothing to read by but
the light of her own horn.

362
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:23,080
Ooh, now that looks fun.

363
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:24,130
But not fun enough.

364
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:27,998
These are the books that made
Twilight the princess she is.

365
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,233
<i>So who's got what it</i>
<i>takes to trade for them?</i>

366
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,717
When you put it
like that...

367
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,200
Wait! Stop.
Come back!

368
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,776
These books aren't that great.

369
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:40,255
Oh, yes they are.

370
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,089
But I thought you wanted
to get rid of them.

371
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,499
None of those ponies had
anything valuable enough

372
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:45,720
to trade for my books.

373
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:48,247
Not because these books
belonged to a princess.

374
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,500
But because they helped make me
who I am, just like you said.

375
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,349
This is the one I was
so absorbed in

376
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:57,182
the day Spike decided he
owed Applejack a life debt.

377
00:18:57,982 --> 00:19:00,249
And this one reminds
me of the day I got it,

378
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,830
which was the day I met you.

379
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,431
I may not ever need
to read these again,

380
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:06,641
but that doesn't mean
they don't have value.

381
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:09,754
I realize that now,
thanks to you, Pinkie.

382
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:11,914
I told you I'd take
care of everything.

383
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:12,757
Twilight!

384
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:14,499
I need you to say a
trade wasn't fair.

385
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:15,492
Fast!

386
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:18,727
I've heard what you
both have to say.

387
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,398
<i>And I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.</i>

388
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,001
But my hooves are tied.

389
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:23,773
You said it was a fair trade.

390
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,337
Yeah, I said it.

391
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,939
But I was wrong.

392
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:30,035
I did want that book. A lot.

393
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,052
I said I wanted it
more than anything

394
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,268
<i>in all of Equestria.</i>

395
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:36,979
But there's no thing that's
worth as much to me as a friend.

396
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:42,046
I might've forgotten that for
a little bit, but it's true.

397
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:45,315
Which means there's no way
this trade can be fair.

398
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:48,212
Oh, come on; that's...

399
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:52,515
the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

400
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,541
OK, the trade's off.

401
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:05,354
And with that, I
declare this trial

402
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:09,131
and this year's Rainbow Falls
Traders Exchange over.

403
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:11,412
Whoo hoo!

404
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:29,079
<i>I know it's not the pie tin</i>
<i>you were after.</i>

405
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,655
But I hope you like it.

406
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,486
It's the rustiest piece
of junk I could get.

407
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,799
Well, I took my half of
our stash and got you this.

408
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,528
Ooooh!

409
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:42,253
<i>And I know you're</i>
<i>gonna love it</i>

410
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,752
cause you already
have a bunch a ones

411
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,069
that look exactly the same

412
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,476
sittin' in a drawer
doin' nothing.

413
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,416
So that should settle
once and for all

414
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:51,014
which of us is the
better friend.

415
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:52,376
Oh, come on!

416
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:55,660
You both gave up what you wanted
to do something for each other.

417
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:57,978
That's the coolest
thing a friend can do.

418
00:20:58,163 --> 00:20:59,551
Trust me, I know.

419
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:02,977
Hey, where's your
double doggie?

420
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:05,746
I traded it for
something way better.

421
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:12,913
Well, what do you know?

422
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:15,758
My copy of Daring Do
and the Sapphire Statue.

423
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,042
It's just a beat
up old paperback,

424
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,491
not a one-of-a-kind
first edition.

425
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:22,464
Even better!

426
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:26,704
Because I can read this
one with all my friends.
