174
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:34,929
What?! NO! Look around us!
Henchponies. Caballeron!

175
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,701
The jungle it took forever to
get to! This is the real deal!

176
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:42,873
Right. We're ACTUALLY being
held captive by Caballeron.

177
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:46,073
Please. This guy's accent
is all over the place.

178
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,483
No offense.

179
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:48,344
I....

180
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,249
So, what's the setup,
here? You've kidnapped us

181
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,461
and taken us to the middle
of nowhere because....?

182
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:58,260
The Temple of Chicomoztoc is
somewhere in this jungle!

183
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,516
When I find it, the Seven-Sided
Chest is as good as mine!

184
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:06,393
I just need the Amulet of
Culhuacan to unlock it!

185
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:09,126
Uh-huh. And Daring
Do has the Amulet,

186
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:11,618
so you came up with this
overcomplicated plot

187
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,947
to lure her into the jungle
and exchange it for us?

188
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:18,387
I wouldn't call it
overcomplicated, but yes.

189
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,443
OK, we're done here. Great work.

190
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,076
Seriously. Very believable.

191
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,566
[slap and shout]

192
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,627
Listen pal, you can keep
her money, but I'm not --

193
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,510
Going anywhere.

194
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,040
You may not approve of my plan,
but I'm the mastermind here.

195
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,009
Debatable.

196
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:42,455
AND I SAY you will remain
here until Daring Do

197
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:45,993
comes to rescue you. And if she
wants you back in one piece,

198
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,966
she will give me the
Amulet! Tie them up.

199
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,396
The Griffon's Lock!

200
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:54,732
You know of it!

201
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,120
Further proof that you
are an agent of Daring Do.

202
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:58,996
Or an avid reader.

203
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:04,043
And now I will continue
my search for the Temple.

204
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:10,436
Don't go anywhere. [evil laugh]

205
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,353
Listen, if I pretend to
believe this nonsense is real,

206
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:17,224
will you call off the henchpony
repertory theater over there?

207
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:20,904
They're not going to listen
to me. They abducted us BOTH!

208
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,715
Oh, wow. So you're going
to stick with that script?

209
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:27,027
Oh, OK fine. We're in
a Daring Do adventure.

210
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:31,858
What was that?

211
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,621
DARING DO! THANK
GOODNESS! WE'RE OVER HERE!

212
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:40,190
Fan out! We can't let
Daring Do rescue these two.

213
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:46,203
All four? I mean, shouldn't at
least one of them stay behind

214
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,664
to guard us? Oh-oh
wait, no because then

215
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,409
it wouldn't be a terrible
Daring Do adventure!

216
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,126
It doesn't matter.

217
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,735
We'll never solve the Griffon's
Lock before they get back.

218
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,701
OK, that was pretty good.

219
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,304
Quick! We've got to get out
of here and warn Daring Do!

220
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,944
No way. Just point
me to the hotel

221
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,307
and you can play fanpony

222
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,301
and hunt treasure
out here all day long.

223
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,329
Fine. Let's say this IS a
Daring Do Adventu-cation.

224
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:18,609
The only way to get back to the
convention is to go through it.

225
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,366
So just follow me and
I'll lead you out. Deal?

226
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,436
Ugh. Fine.

227
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,449
Maybe if I just leave you in
the jungle, it'll convince you.

228
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,744
Which would make Daring Do left-
hoofed, which we KNOW is false!

229
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:35,618
And THAT is everything
that's wrong with Daring Do

230
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:37,335
and the Trek to the
Terrifying Tower.

231
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,784
Now the problems with
the next book are even --

232
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,796
Oh, right. What Daring Do
adventure would be complete

233
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,286
without the precarious
rope bridge?

234
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:55,170
Look, I'm all for making things
feel as real as possible

235
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:59,040
but are these adventu-cation
ponies sure this thing is safe?

236
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,686
Is it too "realistic" for you?

237
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:04,492
Wouldn't want THAT on a
Daring Do adventure, would we?

238
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,726
If this were really a
Daring Do adventure,

239
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,092
I'm sure I'd step on the wrong
plank at exactly the wrong mo-

Won't I? You've led
me to the temple.

273
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:52,713
And Daring Do is too noble to
let harm befall her companions

so the amulet is
as good as mine.

00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,833
The way out is
totally covered!

344
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:31,476
How are we gonna
get out of here?

345
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:33,390
There!

346
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,775
Seriously, do you
ever NOT escape

347
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,147
out of the top of a temple?

348
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,883
We'll have to carry mister
adventure critic out with us.

349
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:44,387
We won't be fast enough!
We'll never make it!

350
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:45,144
Guys!

351
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:49,218
I think Rainbow Dash
and I have this covered.

352
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:55,624
♪♪

353
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:58,633
Go around! You
can't go over him!

354
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:01,218
Go over him? Are you crazy?

355
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:04,658
If Quibble says go
over him, go over him!

356
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:07,975
[scream]

357
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:12,990
You two are insane!

358
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,193
You SAID go over him!

359
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,532
I SAID go around him!

360
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,384
And I said be quiet!

361
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:21,655
This way! I heard them!

362
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:25,378
OK, I've got it. Let's
create a fake treasure

363
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:28,504
out of mud and rocks, give THAT
to Caballeron and then when--

364
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:32,098
Not EVERY Daring Do plan
has to be super complicated.

365
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:36,486
I swear I heard them!

366
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:38,375
[crash]

367
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:40,073
[roar]

368
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:41,267
[scream]

369
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:45,064
I'll get you Daring Doooooooo!

370
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,015
Uh. Not particularly original
or inspired, but it worked.

371
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:52,646
Who are you again?

372
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:53,624
He's a fan.

373
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:57,655
Uh-huh. There's some stairs on
the other side of the temple

374
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,033
that lead out of
the ravine.

375
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:01,741
I suggest you two take
them and head west.

376
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:02,720
What about you?

377
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:06,196
I've got to get this to a
museum. Thanks for your help.

378
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,390
I couldn't have done it
without you. Both of you.

379
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,667
So?

380
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,920
So. Maybe the later books
ARE slightly more realistic

381
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,406
than I gave them credit for.
I still don't like them.

382
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,104
What? How can you--

383
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,683
Wait! Hold on! Before
we get in another fight,

384
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:28,744
I think I finally
figured it out!

385
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,910
I love the Daring Do that solves
puzzles and uses her brain

386
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,227
to get out of tough situations.

387
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:36,818
And she did WAY more of that
in the original trilogy.

388
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,233
YOU love the Daring Do
that is brave and awesome

389
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:42,652
and comes out on top no
matter what the odds.

390
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,584
OK.

391
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:46,221
And that's OK!

392
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:49,058
We might never agree on
what makes Daring Do cool.

393
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:52,313
But YOU are definitely cool.

394
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:56,301
I mean the way you saved
me on the bridge? Wow.

395
00:20:56,646 --> 00:21:01,741
And escaping from the temple!
You, Rainbow Dash, are AWESOME.

396
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:06,516
Well. I'm not the one
who can locate a treasure

397
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:08,849
in half the time Daring Do can.

398
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,058
You may have terrible
taste in books,

399
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,544
but you're pretty
awesome yourself.

400
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,027
In a brainy egghead puzzle-
solving kind of way.

401
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,283
I guess we don't have to agree
on everything to get along.

402
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:21,470
Friends?

403
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:23,243
DEFINITELY friends.

404
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:27,790
Do you think AK
Yearling would consider

405
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,286
letting ME write the next book?

406
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:30,492
I mean, think I could

407
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:31,981
make things way clearer.

408
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,073
I mean for instance, in
the second adventure

409
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,984
there's a side
character;

410
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:36,935
I don't want to kind
of name it right now,

411
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,738
because it's sort of
this thing that I've

412
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,320
already written a lot
of fan fiction on.

413
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:40,947
I don't want you know...

414
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,270
Not that I'm saying that
you would steal it;

415
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:45,015
but I am saying that this
would totally go along,

416
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:47,163
my whole thing about
puzzle solving.

417
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:49,323
Except what if each
puzzle that was solved

418
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,255
unlocked a new karate move?

419
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:52,670
Think of it that way, right?

420
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:54,781
I'm kind of a Yearlite myself,

421
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,461
so I'm sure she'd be open to--

422
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:57,963
Rainbow Dash: Uh, Quibble?

423
00:21:58,393 --> 00:21:58,892
Sorry!
