you're here!

167
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,222
Whoa!

168
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:11,566
Are you OK?

169
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:13,438
Oh! I've never been better.

170
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,744
This book you've
given me is amazing!

171
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,737
Why, I've been up all night
just creating and creating

Wow!

But then I started
thinking, why stop there?

176
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,835
Oh, Spike, I've always
thought this town of ours

177
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,616
could use a few
beautifying upgrades.

178
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,676
And with this book, I can make
that happen with such ease.

179
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,675
You will support me in this
endeavor by letting me

180
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,569
keep the book just
a little longer?

181
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,305
Of course I will!

182
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,444
Hoo!

183
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:55,194
What do you say we get a little
breakfast before we get started?

184
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,439
No time for breakfast.

185
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,363
I want to get
started right away.

Technically, we do have time

If I can get it away from her,

330
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,891
I bet she won't be able
to use its magic anymore.

331

<i>Oh, come on! It's</i>
<i>the perfect plan.</i>

332
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:41,890
I just have to figure
out which way she went.

333
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:43,340
<i>I can't see!</i>

334

<i>(screams)</i>

335
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,543
I'm thinking she's
headed this way.

<i>(evil cackle)</i>

What do you think
you're doing?

338
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:15,112
Me? I was just uh, basking
in your creative radiance.

339
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:19,810
Oh, Spike, you do say
the nicest things!

340
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:21,174
Thanks.

341
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:23,449
Now where was I?

342
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,105
Oh, yes!

343
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:31,680
Gold-plated roof-tops
for everypony!

344
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,048
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:40,803

Of course you have;
you're Rarity.

00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,669
My work here in Ponyville
is nearly complete.

352
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:59,947
Don't you think it's time
the rest of Equestria

353
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:01,840
benefited from my
creative vision?

354
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,781
Absolutely!

355
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm thinking we go by chariot.

356
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,803
Or as everyone will soon
be calling them, "Rariot".

The book is gone.

Gone?

366
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,424

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,026
What have you done
with my book?

370

We're friends.

373

It was probably the owl!

Hoo!

00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:53,459
But, wait, I don't seem
to need it anymore, do I?

Yes! Yes!

<i>Oh, the places</i>

Manehattan.

Phillydelphia.

383
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,107
Canterlot.

384
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:12,448
And there you'll
be by my side.

385
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,499
Just as you've always
been here in Ponyville.

386
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,157
Your constant praise and
adoration driving me

387
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:18,349
to even greater heights

388
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,265
until there isn't an
inch of Equestria

389
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:22,115
that hasn't been
utterly transformed

390
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,326
by my creative genius!

No!

What did you say?

394
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,206
I said, "No!"

395
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:37,828
You've been changing things,

396
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:39,182
but you haven't been
making them better.

397
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,964
I should have told you the
truth at the very beginning,

398
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:42,626
but I didn't

399
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,579
because I was trying to be
a supportive friend.

400
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:50,124
But instead I let you
become something awful.

401
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,208
Awful?

402
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:05,326
What happened?

403
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,892
Rarity, you're OK?

404
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:10,569
I...I think so.

405
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:14,788
Though by the looks of it,
something quite terrifying

406
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,552
has happened to Ponyville.

407
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:18,760
You happened.

408
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:20,144
Me?

409
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:23,564
The last part of the spell!

410
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:26,846
"Only when true
words are spoken,

411

will you finally be set free."

412
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,228
The spell took over you

413
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:34,195
and you wanted to change
everything in Equestria.

414
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,399
I was afraid to tell you
how I really felt about it,

415
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,462
but then I, I told
you the truth.

416
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:45,034
Dearest Spike, you should never
be afraid to tell me the truth.

417

Never, ever, ever take another

Princess Cadance

429
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:14,005
have much better things to do
than help me clean up Ponyville.

430
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,565
Do you have any idea how
hard it was to reverse

431
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:19,910
that much dark magic?

432
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,451
You don't look so good.

433
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:25,592
What?

434
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:27,010
I'm just being honest.

435
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,682
It's what good friends do.
