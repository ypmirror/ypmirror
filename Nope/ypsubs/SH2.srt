00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,460
Rainbow Dash, I simply don't understand
why you can't just play the guitar you have.

2
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,050
Now I understand.

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,550
- How about this one?
- No.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,800
- Lookie here!
- No.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,840
- Super groovy!
- No, Pinkie.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,560
- Well, whatcha looking for?
- That's the problem!

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,390
I need something that looks as awesome
as I'm gonna make it sound.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,110
Hands off my guitar, Trixie!

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,740
I touched it first, Rainbow Dash!

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,950
Sounds to me like this is
a makin' for a nice, friendly competition.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,580
All right!
Let's see who plays best!

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,080
A shred-off?

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,960
Shred on.

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,380
Check me out!

15
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,800
Uh, she can have it.

16
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,510
Turns out this is the one
that really speaks to me.

17
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,560
The Great and Powerful Trixie
always wins in the end!

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,480
I doubt it.

19
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,700
Twelve-thousand dollars?!

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,750
You'll pay for this,
Rainbow Dash!

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,210
No, silly!
If you want it, you have to pay for it.
