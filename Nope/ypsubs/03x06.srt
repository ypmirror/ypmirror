1
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,250
Nice moves, kid.

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,990
Nice moves?
Rainbow Dash thinks I've got--

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,440
nice moves!

7
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,530
...then, all of a sudden,
I'm airborne!

8
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,950
And Rainbow Dash looks over,
and is like "Nice moves, kid".

9
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,630
She really said that?

10
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,840
I mean, it's like she practically told me
she wanted to take me under her wing,

11
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,890
teach me everything she knows,
and become like my big sister!

12
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,430
I dunno about all that.

13
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,270
It was a really nice
compliment and all, but...

14
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,810
I know, I know.

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,730
But all that stuff I said
could happen, right?

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,730
- Sure
- Absolutely.

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,500
I just need to find a way
to spend some time with her,

18
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,690
y'know, so she can see
more of my awesomeness!

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,040
Applejack and I are supposed
to be camping up

20
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,720
at Winsome Falls
this weekend.

21
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,880
Maybe I could get my big sis

22
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,630
to invite Rainbow Dash,
and then you could come too!

23
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,280
- Really?
- Sure!

24
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,030
I wanna go...

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,630
Well, duh...
of course you can go!

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,790
And I'll get Rarity to come too!

27
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,920
Rarity loves camping!

28
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,080
I despise camping!

29
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,640
All of that... nature.

30
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,280
Applejack's going
with her little sister!

31
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,490
But, y'know,

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,380
if you don't wanna
spend time with me...

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,490
All right!

34
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,900
Ooh! Of course,
I will need to find an outfit

35
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,120
more appropriate
for 'roughing it'.

36
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,280
See?
Told you she'd wanna go.

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,731
- You packed bug spray?
- Yup.

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,370
- You got the canteens?
- Yup.

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,440
Looks like we're all set then.

40
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,430
Hey!

41
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,980
Gee Rarity,
did you remember to pack?

42
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,880
Well, let's see
who gets the last laugh

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,830
when you're absolutely desparate
to curl your lashes,

44
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,510
and you realize you didn't bring
your eyelash curler.

45
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,430
Well, looks like
we're all set now.

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,580
But what about Rainbow Dash?
Isn't Rainbow Dash coming?

47
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,230
'Course she is, sugarcube.

48
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,430
She's gonna meet us up
at our first campsite.

49
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,950
Alright, y'all,
let's move 'em out!

50
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,290
Oh, are we there yet?

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,580
The last thousand times
you asked that,

52
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,080
the answer was no.

53
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,880
This time, it's actually yes.

54
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,840
There's Rainbow Dash
up there right now.

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Alright, Scootaloo,
just play it cool.

56
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,380
Hey, Rai--

57
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,570
Hey, Rainbow Dash!
What's up?

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,200
What took you guys so long?

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,730
Well, some of us didn't pack
as light as the others.

60
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,650
So we were slowed down a bit.

61
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,010
Looks like you'll be sharing
a tent with me, huh?

62
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
If that's okay with you.

63
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,530
Sure! As long as you don't snore.

64
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,330
You don't snore, do you?

65
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,030
Nope. No way. Not me!

66
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,630
Never snored a day
or a night in my life.

67
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,600
Then you and I are
gonna get along just fine.

68
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,430
You've got to be kidding me...

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,450
Sweetie Belle,

70
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,410
do be a dear and see if you can find
some fresh flowers for my bedside vase.

71
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,410
Hey, Scootaloo,

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,760
do be a sweetheart and see
if you can gather some firewood.

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,880
Seriously though.

74
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,630
Can you get us
some wood for the fire?

75
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,260
Of course!

76
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,300
Okay, everybody get comfortable.

77
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,980
'Cause I'm about to tell you
the best story you ever heard.

78
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,880
Is it about the time
when Rarity had wings,

79
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,030
and then they got ruined,

80
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,830
and then you saved her
from plummeting to her doom?

81
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,570
Okay, maybe it's the second
best story you ever heard.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,420
But probably still the scariest.

83
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,830
You like scary stories, right?

84
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,530
It all happened on a night,

85
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,020
just like this one.

86
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,617
In a forest,

87
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,499
just like this.

88
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,420
...and then,
the olden pony asked,

89
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,140
<i>"Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"</i>

90
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,790
Not me!

91
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,830
You do!

92
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,230
Something in my throat.
I wasn't scared at all!

93
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,650
Good story!

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,490
Knew you wouldn't be scared.

95
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,990
The way you jumped
that cart the other day...

96
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,530
you were like me, fearless.

97
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
Yeah. Fearless.

98
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,200
Don't worry, Rarity is here
to keep you safe and sound.

99
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,230
Think it's about time for me
to hit the straw.

100
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,550
Don't you worry, little sis.

101
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,800
There's no 'olden pony' in our tent.

102
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,740
That sure was funny, wasn't it!

103
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,220
How they were all afraid
of the olden pony...

104
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,900
but not me!

105
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,230
That's because you're tough,
just like I was when I was your age!

106
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,880
I'm hitting the sack.

107
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,630
Come in whenever you feel like it.

108
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,670
It's, it's nothing...
Just my imagination...

109
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,290
And that isn't the thundering
stamp of the olden pony...

110
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,600
I-Is anyone out there?

111
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,460
Who's got my rusty horseshoe?

112
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,750
Who's got my rusty horseshoe?

113
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,940
Rainbow Da--?

114
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,360
You do!

115
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,730
What's that noise?

116
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,670
Is there a bug in here?

117
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,430
I dunno about you,
but I slept like a filly.

118
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,900
Best night ever!

119
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,860
Glad you're rested up, because
we've got a long trek ahead.

120
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,060
Totally gonna be worth it
when we get to Winsome Falls.

121
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,670
Yeah... Totally...

122
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,500
Am I sweating?
I think I'm sweating!

123
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,670
But it's absolutely worth it to get
to spend time with my little sister.

124
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,170
It just feels like this cart
is getting heavier all the time!

125
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,420
I don't care if that cart
is heavy as a pack of mules.

126
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,560
If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark
before we get to the campsite!

127
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,810
Dark?!

128
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,860
I'll just ride ahead
to make sure the path is clear.

129
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,820
Now we don't wanna be
out here after dark, right?

130
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,260
Doesn't matter to me.

131
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,310
Well, y'know...

132
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,610
it's for the scaredy-ponies.

133
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,020
Don't fall asleep now...

134
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,370
I've got to get to
that campsite before dark...

135
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,780
Don't come this way!

136
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,970
Take the path!
It's... aheh...

137
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,900
way better than going
through the bushes.

138
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,480
You're more nervous
than a worm in an apple

139
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,870
on cider making day.

140
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,340
What gives, Scootaloo?

141
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,020
Nothing!
Just thought I heard something.

142
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,580
You sure you're okay?
'Cause you seem a little jumpy.

143
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,180
Just getting my exercise!

144
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,720
You know how important it is
to stretch out those hindquarters

145
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,600
every so often!

146
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,610
Uh, do you need a little help?

147
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,160
That's so sweet, thank you.

148
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,920
What are friends for?

149
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,300
No need for tents tonight, y'all.

150
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,490
We'll just take shelter in that cave.

151
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,460
All right!
A deep, dark cave!

152
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,830
Perfect for the story
I've got for tonight.

153
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,920
All we need is a campfire,
and we're good to go.

154
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,310
Uh, of course...

155
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,570
I'll be right back with loads
of firewood from the deep,

156
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,220
dark, not-scary-at-all forest!

157
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,370
Thanks!

158
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,880
Okay. I can do this.

159
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,280
On the count of three,
I get those branches.

160
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,250
One... two... three!

161
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,210
Here, branches branches branches...

162
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,220
It's colder than
a timberwolf's toenail.

163
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,550
Where's that Scootaloo?

164
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
Here you go!

165
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,820
That's it?

166
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,820
It's all I could find,
'cause, y'know...

167
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,070
there aren't that
many trees around here!

168
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
It's all we need.

169
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,830
Why don't you sit with
Rainbow Dash for a while?

170
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,480
Now, where was I?
Oh yeah!

171
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,590
The scary part...

172
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,710
Hey, I have an idea!

173
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,820
How about I tell tonight's story?

174
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,310
Alright, just make sure
it's a horrible one.

175
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,560
There once was
a really really nice pony

176
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,980
who lived in a bright
and sunny land,

177
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,980
where there are
rainbows every day,

178
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,960
and lots and lots
of happy friends, and--

179
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,070
No offense, but,

180
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,870
it's not a real campfire story
unless somepony's shaking.

181
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,290
I've been told that
these very woods are haunted...

182
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,920
by the headless horse!

183
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,380
It gallops only at night.

184
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,640
If he doesn't have a head,

185
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,020
then how in tarnation does
this pony know where it's goin'?

186
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,440
It's headless, not brainless.

187
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,320
...looking for little lost ponies.

188
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,200
So where is its brain?

189
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,350
Fear was dripping from the air...

190
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,080
...and they were never heard from
ever again!

191
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,880
Never?

192
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,880
Never.

193
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,330
Don't worry, you'll be safe
with me tonight.

194
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,830
- It's not time for bed yet, is it?
- 'Fraid so, Scootaloo.

195
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,460
Uh, but we haven't sung
any campfire songs yet!

196
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,590
You don't have to ask me twice!

197
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,220
Ninety-nine buckets of oats
on the wall,

198
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,260
ninety-nine buckets of oats!

199
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,770
Take one down,
pass it around,

200
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,270
you got eighty-one
buckets of oats on the wall!

201
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,350
Forty-one buckets of oats!

202
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,230
Take one down,
pass it around,

203
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,320
you got forty...
buckets of oats on the wall!

204
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,470
Take one down,
pass it around,

205
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,973
you've got zero buckets of oats
on the waaaallll!!

206
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,970
- Good night, y'all.
- Good night, y'all.

207
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,370
Sleep tight.

208
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,330
Oh, just one more song!

209
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,000
Anyone?

210
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,750
How about a dance contest?

211
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,970
I know you love to cut a rug,

212
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,770
so how 'bout
we mess up a cave floor?

213
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,720
I have a brilliant idea!

214
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,400
Hide and seek, who's with me?

215
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,970
Maybe tomorrow.

216
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,070
Seems like you don't really
wanna go to sleep tonight.

217
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,650
Is there some reason why?

218
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,540
Pfft, of course not!

219
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,090
I just love camping and hanging out
with Rainbow Dash so much

220
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,060
that I don't wanna waste
a single minute with sleep!

221
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,080
Silly sleep.

222
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,130
That's cool and all, Scoot.

223
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,510
But this pony needs her shut-eye
and she needs it now!

224
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,400
This is so unfair...

225
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,420
I'm falling asleep...

226
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,420
If the headless horse catches me,

227
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm never gonna be heard from again!

228
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,210
And I wanna be heard from!

229
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,140
It's all over!

230
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,930
A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo.

231
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,450
Princess Luna!

232
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,480
I thought you were
the headless horse!

233
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,160
You were mistaken,
but I hope not disappointed.

234
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,380
You are so, so much better
than the headless horse!

235
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,170
But what are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?

236
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,440
I am the princess of the night.

237
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,160
Thus it is my duty
to come into your dreams.

238
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,370
Oh yeah... wait.

239
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,010
This is just a dream?

240
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,820
But it feels so real!

241
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,030
I assure you that you are asleep.

242
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,610
But when you awake,

243
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,090
the thing that frightens you most
will still exist.

244
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,100
The headless horse?

245
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,740
Is the headless horse really
what frightens you the most?

246
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,010
I'm afraid Rainbow Dash
will find out I'm not as tough

247
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,820
as she thinks I am.

248
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,250
Everypony has fears, Scootaloo.

249
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,620
Everypony must face them
in their own way.

250
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,450
But they must be faced,
or the nightmares will continue.

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,540
Face your fears!

252
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,560
Princess Luna?!

253
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,050
It was just a dream.

254
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,760
But the headless horse isn't!

255
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,440
Rainbow Dash said it lives here,
in these very woods!

256
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,650
It's the wicked whinny
of the headless horse!

257
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,420
So, it's a horse without a head...

258
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,580
which means
it doesn't have a mouth...

259
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,920
and if it doesn't have a mouth,
then...

260
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,250
it's not a horsey pony
but a horse...

261
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,110
but still...

262
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,840
it's a horse... without a head!

263
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,210
Hello?!
Is anyone out there?

264
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
Anyone except the headless horse?

265
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,830
Heellllp!

266
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,880
I gotcha!

267
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,960
Rainbow Dash! Is that you?
Thank you, thank you!

268
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,810
What were you doing out here
in the middle of the night?!

269
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,350
It is time for you to face
your real fear, Scootaloo!

270
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,840
I'm so, so sorry,
Rainbow Dash,

271
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,490
I just wanted you to hang out
with me and see how cool I was

272
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,120
so you'd take me under your wing
and teach me everything you know

273
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,330
and become like my big sister!

274
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,750
But then you started telling
those spooky stories and I got scared!

275
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,860
I thought I heard the headless horse
so I ran out here by myself, and...

276
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,680
Well, I guess you know the rest.

277
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,100
Hey, I'm gonna tell you something,
but if you ever tell anypony else,

278
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,540
I'm gonna deny it.

279
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,340
First time I heard those stories...

280
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,150
I was scared too.

281
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,230
- You were?
- Sure!

282
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,540
I mean, I got over it
because I realized pretty quick

283
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,820
that if there was such thing
as a headless horse,

284
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,700
I could totally take it on!

285
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,040
So, you're looking for somepony
to take you under their wing, huh?

286
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,290
Yeah, I might be up
for something like that.

287
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,580
Really?

288
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,900
As long as you don't go falling

289
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,490
into any more rivers
in the middle of the night.

290
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,020
It's a deal.

291
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,140
I call sister teams!

292
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,810
Last pair to make it to the falls
is a mouldy carrot!

293
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,540
Ugh, if you insist.

294
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,820
It is so on!

295
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,820
They think they can beat
the two of us?

296
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,470
Who's got my rusty horseshoe?

297
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,220
Here it is, for pony's sake.

298
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,750
Now take it and stop
all your moaning.

299
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,360
Thank you, and have a nice day.
