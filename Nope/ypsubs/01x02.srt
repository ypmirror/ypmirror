1
00:00:03,288 --> 00:00:06,447
Elements of Harmony...
See: Mare in the Moon?

2
00:00:06,463 --> 00:00:08,041
But that's just an old ponies' tale!

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,133
She will bring about nighttime eternal!

4
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:12,711
It's imperative that
the Princess is told right away.

5
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:15,902
See? I knew she would wanna
take immediate action.

6
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:20,127
My dear Twilight. There is more to
a young pony's life than studying.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,761
Make some friends!

8
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:26,329
All the ponies in this town are CRAZY!

9
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:29,317
I hope the Princess was right.

10
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,091
She's gone!

11
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:34,419
Oh no. Nightmare Moon!

12
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:21,075
Seize her! Only she knows
where the Princess is!

13
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:23,991
Stand back, you foals!

14
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:32,645
Come back here!

15
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:37,412
Nighttime? Forever?

16
00:01:39,694 --> 00:01:41,101
Where's she going?

17
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:46,167
We gotta stop Nightmare...!

18
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:53,460
You've been up all night, Spike.
You are a baby dragon after all.

19
00:01:57,973 --> 00:01:59,638
Elements, elements, elements...

20
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:03,345
How can I stop Nightmare Moon
without the Elements of Harmony?!

21
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,894
And just what are the Elements of Harmony?!

22
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,341
And how did you know about
Nightmare Moon, huh?

23
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:09,742
Are you a spy?

24
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:14,597
Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy.

25
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:18,943
But she sure knows what's going on.
Don't you, Twilight?

26
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,252
I read all about the
prediction of Nightmare Moon.

27
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:28,590
Some mysterious objects called the Elements of
Harmony are the only things that can stop her.

28
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:33,010
But I don't know what they are. Where to
find them. I don't even know what they do!

29
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,423
The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide.

30
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:37,478
How did you find that?!

31
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,436
IT WAS UNDER "E"!

32
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:47,482
"There are six Elements of Harmony,
but only five are known..."

33
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,010
"Kindness, Laughter, Generosity,
Honesty and Loyalty."

34
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,617
"The sixth is a complete mystery."

35
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:56,847
"It is said, the last known
location of the five Elements..."

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,708
"...was in the ancient castle of the royal
pony sisters. It is located in what is now..."

37
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,615
The Everfree Forest!

38
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,605
Whee! Let's go!

39
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:14,294
Not so fast!

40
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:19,717
Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd
really rather do this on my own.

41
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:25,037
No can do, sugar cube. We sure ain't lettin' any
friend of ours goin' to that creepy place alone.

42
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,309
We're stickin' to you like
caramel to candy apple.

43
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:32,429
Especially if there's candy apples in there.

44
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,259
What? Those things are good!

45
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:45,298
So none of you have been in here before?

46
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:50,260
Heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful!

47
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:54,713
And it ain't natural. Folk say
it don't work the same as Equestria.

48
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,178
What's that supposed to mean?

49
00:03:56,372 --> 00:04:00,937
Nopony knows. You know why?

50
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,397
Rainbow! Quit it!

51
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:04,950
Cause everypony who's ever come in...

52
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:08,188
...has never... come... OUT!

53
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:11,886
Fluttershy! Quick!

54
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:13,239
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...

55
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,794
Hold on! I'm a-comin'!

56
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,010
Applejack! What do I do?!

57
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:33,439
Let go.

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,457
-Are you crazy?!
-No, I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.

59
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,835
That's not true!

60
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:43,002
Now listen here. What I'm sayin'
to you is the honest truth.

61
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,316
Let go and you'll be safe.

62
00:04:55,504 --> 00:05:00,111
Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding
anything more than a bunny or two.

63
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:13,659
And once Pinkie and Rarity
were saved, WHOA...

64
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:18,775
Me and Fluttershy loop-de-looped around and WHAM!
Got you right in a nick of time.

65
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,928
Yes, Rainbow, I was there.
And I'm very grateful, but we gotta...

66
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,810
A manticore!

67
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,493
We've gotta get past him!

68
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,572
Take that, you ruffian!

69
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:36,728
MY HAIR!

70
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:39,757
Wait...

71
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:44,853
YEEHAW! Get along, little doggie!

72
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,917
Wait...

73
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,751
-All yours, partner.
-I'm on it!

74
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:52,865
Wait...!

75
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:58,335
Rainbow!

76
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,004
WAIT!!!

77
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:16,343
Shhh... It's okay.

78
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:24,523
Oh, you poor, poor little baby.

79
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,195
Little?

80
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:29,416
Now this might hurt for juuust a second.

81
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,795
Fluttershy!

82
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:42,076
Are you just a little baby kitty, aren't you?
Yesh you are, yesh you are.

83
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:45,379
How did you know about the thorn?

84
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,689
I didn't. Sometimes we all just
need to be shown a little kindness.

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,135
My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck.

86
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,244
Well, I didn't mean that literally.

87
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,782
That ancient ruin could be right in front
of our faces and we wouldn't even know it!

88
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,009
Oh wait. I think I stepped in somethin'.

89
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,161
It's just mud.

90
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:44,923
Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!

91
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,244
Oh, girls. Don't you see...?

92
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:53,516
<i>When I was a little filly and
the sun was going dooown...</i>

93
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,573
Tell me she's not...

94
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:59,991
<i>The darkness and the shadows, they
would always make me frooown...</i>

95
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,151
She is.

96
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:05,233
<i>I'd hide under my pillow
from what I thought I saw,</i>

97
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:09,715
<i>But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
to deal with fears at aaall!</i>

98
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:10,568
Then what is?

99
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:15,458
<i>She said: Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall,
learn to face your fears.</i>

100
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:20,316
<i>You'll see that they can't hurt you,
just laugh to make them disappear.</i>

101
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:27,899
<i>Sooo, giggle at the ghostly!</i>

102
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,995
<i>Guffaw at the grossly!</i>

103
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,411
<i>Crack up at the creepy!</i>

104
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,299
<i>Whoop it up with the weepy!</i>

105
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:36,533
<i>Chortle at the cooky!</i>

106
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,967
<i>Snortle at the spooky!</i>

107
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:41,252
And tell that big dumb scary face
to take a hike and leave you alone...

108
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:45,752
Andifhethinkshecanscareyouthenhesgotanotherthink
comingandtheveryideaofsuchathingjustmakesyouwanna...

109
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:54,213
<i>LAAAUGH!</i>

110
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:10,180
Where are we gonna cross *this*?

111
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,872
What a world, what a world...!

112
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,648
Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?

113
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:28,215
Well, I don't know. I was just sitting
here, minding my own business...

114
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:32,804
...when this tacky little cloud of
purple smoke just whisked past me...

115
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,515
...and tore a half of my beloved mustache...

116
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:37,349
...CLEAN OFF!

117
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:41,177
And now I look simply horrid!

118
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:48,030
-Oh, gimme a break!
-That's what all the fuss is about?

119
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:52,735
Why, of course it is!
How can you be so insensitive?

120
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:57,845
Oh, just look at him.
Such lovely luminescent scales...!

121
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,080
I know.

122
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,702
...and your expertly coiffed mane...!

123
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,360
Oh, I know, I know.

124
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:07,911
...your fabulous manicure...!

125
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:10,323
It's so true!

126
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:13,610
All ruined without your beautiful mustache!

127
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,680
It's true, I'm hideous!

128
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:21,811
I simply cannot let such a crime
against fabulosity go uncorrected!

129
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:26,067
What did you do that for?!

130
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,542
Rarity, what are you...

131
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,836
My mustache! How wonderful!

132
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:51,836
You look smashing!

133
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:54,651
Oh, Rarity! Your beautiful tail!

134
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:59,042
Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are
in the season.

135
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:01,438
Besides, it'll grow back.

136
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,517
So would the mustache...

137
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,176
We can cross now! Let's go...!

138
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,078
Allow me.

139
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:23,303
There it is! The ruin that holds
the Elements of Harmony! We made it!

140
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,515
Twilight! Wait for us!

141
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,691
We're almost there!

142
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:35,046
What's with you and falling off cliffs today?

143
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,275
Now what?!

144
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,802
-Duh!
-Oh yeah!

145
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:50,860
-Rainbow...! Rainbow...!
-Who's there?

146
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,051
I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!

147
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:59,103
We've been eagerly awaiting the arrival
of the best flyer in Equestria.

148
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:02,897
-Who?
-Why you, of course!

149
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,962
Really?! I mean... Oh yeah! Me!

150
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:09,462
Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling
the Wonderbolts that, would ya?

151
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,865
'Cos I've been trying to get
into that group for, like, ever!

152
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:16,475
No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us!

153
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:18,173
The Shadowbolts!

154
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:21,775
We're the greatest aerial
team in the Everfree Forest.

155
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:25,370
And soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria.

156
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,669
But first, we need a captain.

157
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,956
-The most magnificent...
-Yep!

158
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:34,430
-...swiftest...
-Yes!

159
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,366
-...bravest flyer in all the land!
-Yes! It's all true!

160
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:39,586
We need...

161
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:41,243
...you!

162
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,694
Sign me up!

163
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:46,417
Just let me tie this bridge real
quick and then we have a deal.

164
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,836
No! It's them or us!

165
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:52,973
Rainbow! What's taking so long?

166
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:54,126
Oh no.

167
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:56,410
Rainbow!

168
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:00,749
Don't listen to them!

169
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:04,017
Well...?

170
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,330
You...

171
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:08,979
Thank you! For the offer, I mean.

172
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,411
But... I'm afraid I have to say no.

173
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:26,765
See? I'd never leave my friends hanging!

174
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,439
Wow.

175
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,130
Come on, Twilight! Isn't this
what you've been waitin' for?

176
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:41,283
The Elements of Harmony! We've found them!

177
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,663
Careful... Careful...!

178
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,343
One, two, three, four...

179
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:50,903
There's only five!

180
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:52,599
Where's the sixth?

181
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:55,307
The book said: "When the five are present..."

182
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:58,069
"...a spark will cause
the sixth Element to be revealed."

183
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,400
What in the hay is that supposed to mean?

184
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:02,255
I'm not sure, but I have an idea.

185
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,714
Stand back. I don't know what will happen.

186
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,651
Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.

187
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,855
Twilight!

188
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,341
The Elements!

189
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:40,473
-Twilight! Where are you?!
-Look!

190
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,051
Come on!

191
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:59,455
You're kidding. You're kidding, right?

192
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,048
Just one spark...

193
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:18,180
Come on, come on!

194
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,844
No! No!

195
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:37,970
But... where's the sixth Element?!

196
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:47,576
You little foal! Thinking you could defeat me!?

197
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:52,108
Now you will never see your Princess.
Or your sun!

198
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:56,030
THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER!

199
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:10,752
You think you can destroy
the Elements of Harmony just like that?

200
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:12,454
Well, you're wrong.

201
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:16,694
Because the spirits of
the Elements of Harmony are right HERE!

202
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:20,611
What?

203
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:24,615
Applejack, who reassured me when I was
in doubt represents the spirit of...

204
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:26,138
Honesty!

205
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,908
Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with
her compassion represents the spirit of...

206
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,480
Kindness!

207
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:39,100
Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in
the face of danger represents the spirit of...

208
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:40,682
Laughter!

209
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:47,773
Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with
a meaningful gift represents the spirit of...

210
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,364
Generosity!

211
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:55,348
And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon
her friends for her own heart's desire
represents the spirit of...

212
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:57,037
Loyalty!

213
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:02,005
The spirits of these five ponies got us
through every challenge you threw at us!

214
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,309
You still don't have the sixth Element!
The spark didn't work!

215
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,999
But it did. A different kind of spark.

216
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,039
I felt it the very moment I realized how
happy I was to hear you... To see you...

217
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:16,021
How much I cared about you!

218
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:20,738
The spark ignited inside me
when I realized that you all...

219
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:23,251
...are my friends!

220
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:35,060
You see, Nightmare Moon, when those
Elements are ignited by the...

221
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:38,557
...the spark that resides in the heart of us all...

222
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:41,150
...it creates the sixth Element: The Element of...

223
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:42,732
Magic!

224
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:59,386
NOOOOOO!!!

225
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:17,500
My head...

226
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,914
Everypony okay?

227
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:21,722
Oh, thank goodness!

228
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:24,760
Why Rarity, it's so lovely!

229
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:27,951
I know! I'll never part with it again!

230
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:32,835
No. Your necklace. It looks
just like your cutie mark.

231
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,824
So does yours!

232
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,123
Look at mine! Look at mine!

233
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:41,017
Oooh yeah!

234
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:46,229
Gee, Twilight! I though you were
just spoutin' a lot of hooey.

235
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:50,157
But I reckon we really do represent
the elements of friendship.

236
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,564
Indeed you do.

237
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,275
Princess Celestia!

238
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:13,529
Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student.

239
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,734
I knew you could do it.

240
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,777
But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.

241
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:23,061
I told you that you needed to
make some friends. Nothing more.

242
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:25,634
I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return...

243
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:29,574
...and I knew it was you who had
the magic inside to defeat her.

244
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:33,445
But you could not unleash it until you
let true friendship into your heart.

245
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:36,923
Now if only another will as well.

246
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:39,114
Princess Luna...

247
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:43,526
It is been a thousand years since
I have seen you like this.

248
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:49,383
Time to put our differences behind us.
We were meant to rule together, little sister.

249
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,567
Sister?!

250
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,746
Will you accept my friendship?

251
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,181
I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!

252
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,837
I've missed you, too.

253
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:12,034
...Hey! You know what this calls for?

254
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,051
A PARTY!

255
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:38,548
Why so glum, my faithful student?

256
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:43,870
Are you not happy that Equestria is complete?
And you can return to your studies in Canterlot?

257
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:50,406
That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful
it is to have friends, I have to leave them.

258
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:53,145
Spike! Take a note, please.

259
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,912
I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree...

260
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:02,190
...that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall
take on a new mission for Equestria.

261
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,967
She must continue to study
the magic of friendship.

262
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,624
She must report to me her findings
from her new home in Ponyville.

263
00:21:12,842 --> 00:21:17,827
Oh thank you, Princess Celestia!
I'll study harder than ever before!

264
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:29,471
Isn't this exciting? AreyouexcitedcauseImexcited

265
