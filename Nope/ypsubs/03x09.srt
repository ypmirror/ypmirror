1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,000
Six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,720
That's not that many.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,200
Are you kidding?

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,240
How are you supposed
to read 12 books in one weekend?

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,060
Princess Celestia
obviously thinks I can

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,100
or she would never have assigned
them to me.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,030
I'm not planning
on letting her down.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,080
Well, I hope you're not planning
on sleeping, then, either.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,720
Actually, Spike, why don't you
take the day off?

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,490
- Really?
- Why not?

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,750
These books are gonna
keep me busy for a while.

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,000
I do have a long list of things
I've been dying to do!

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,550
"Touch nose with tongue."

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,750
Done!

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,420
"Play bongos on my belly."

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,950
Done!

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,730
"Smell my dirty feet."

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,310
Done!

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,400
That didn't take nearly
as long as I thought it would.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,640

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,900
What to do?
What to do?

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,940
A hot air balloon ride!

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,450
Oh no!

26
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,280
Wait!
Runaway balloon!

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,050
Sorry!

28
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,610
That was a close one.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,240
If I didn't know better,

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,270
I would swear that I was in the middle
of the dark and scary Everfree forest!

31
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,920
What was that?!

32
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,350
Come on, Spike.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,800
Just because this forest is full
of wild, dangerous animals

34
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,990
doesn't mean
that you're gonna see one!

35
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,320
Come and get me,
you big goons!

36
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,710
I'm running!
I'm running!

37
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,000
Wow, Applejack.
That was amazing!

38
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,970
I mean, you rocketed those boulders
at them like they were rockets!

39
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,900
You saved my life!

40
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,330
You... saved my life.

41
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,470
Aw, don't mention it, Spike.

42
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,580
Come on, we should be heading
on back now.

43
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,750
Man, am I lucky you were out here!

44
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,540
Uh, why were you out here?

45
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,610
Saw the balloon floating by
with no pony in it.

46
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,050
Came out here to investigate.

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,670
Guess you did too, huh?

48
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,020
Uh, yeah!

49
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,650
I was investigating
the runaway hot air balloon too!

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,970
So...

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
now that the mystery's been solved,
let's get out here, huh?

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,500
Thanks for walking me home, Spike.
That was mighty kind of you!

53
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,620
But now I have some chores that
need tending to, so see you later.

54
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,650
What chores?
I'll do them!

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,050
That's sweet,
but you don't have--

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,040
It's the least I can do.
You saved my life!

57
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,450
I need to repay the favor.

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,050
Shoot, Spike, that's what
friends do for each other.

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,710
You don't need
to repay the favor!

60
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,010
Yes, I do.

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,250
Sugar, it's okay.
It's not necessary.

62
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Applejack, you don't understand!

63
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,000
This is something
that I really need to do!

64
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,260
Well, I hate to get in the way of you
doing something you need to.

65
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,010
Great!
What should I do?

66
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,650
Uh... Apple Bloom's over yonder,
giving little Piggington a bath.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,200
I was gonna lend her a hoof, but,
maybe you could lend her one instead.

68
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,350
On the double!

69
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,360
Applejack said I could help you!

70
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,450
Great!
I could use all the help I can get!

71
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,560
Wait till Applejack sees
how you sparkle!

72
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,420
Good job, you two!

73
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,850
Applejack,
is it okay if I get going?

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,050
I don't wanna be late
for my Crusaders meeting.

75
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,250
We're getting fitted
for water skis!

76
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,640
You definitely don't want
to be late for that...

77
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,400
Water-skiing Cutie Mark,
here I come!

78
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,050
Spike, you can head on out too.

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,180
I reckon you have re-paid me in full
so we are officially even-Steven.

80
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,830
What? Oh, no!

81
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,610
We aren't even close
to being even-Steven!

82
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,610
Please, Applejack, you must
allow me to assist you further!

83
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,850
I don't know, Spike.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,700
Just don't feel right to have you
doing things for me.

85
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,490
- Please.
- Really, you don't--

86
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,580
- Pretty please.
- It's just not necessary.

87
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,170
Pretty, pretty, pretty please?

88
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,600
Oh, all right.

89
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,790
You can help Granny Smith
and me bake some...

90
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,350
Pies! Pies!

91
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm helping Applejack
make some pies!

92
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,300
Spike, little feller,

93
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,590
could you get us
some more eggs?

94
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,180
Coming right up!

95
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,150
Ah, oops.
Sorry, Applejack!

96
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,700
Let me get something
to clean that up!

97
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,520
Appreciate all your help today,
sugar cube, but,

98
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,080
I can take it from here.

99
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,420
Don't be ridiculous!

100
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,460
It is my honor and my duty.
Today is just the beginning!

101
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,800
- What's that now?
- You saved my life!

102
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,180
According to the
"Spike the Dragon Code,"

103
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,450
I owe you a life debt
and must serve you.

104
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,700
Now, what about Twilight?

105
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,350
Doesn't she need your help
and such?

106
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,950
Huh. You're right.

107
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,550
I better break the news
to Twilight!

108
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,030
I just hope she doesn't
take it too hard...

109
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,440
Be right back!

110
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,350
Come on, Spike.

111
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,050
This is your personal moral, ethical
Dragon Code we're talking about.

112
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,780
You have to do this!

113
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,200
It's not like you and Twilight
won't be friends anymore.

114
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,650
But it won't be the same...

115
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,040
But it has to be done!

116
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,220
Twilight, Applejack
just saved my life

117
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,940
from horrible,
dragon-eating Timberwolves!

118
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,860
And, as you are aware,
I adhere to my Dragon Code

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,980
and this means I must serve her
for the rest of my natural-born days.

120
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,710
I'm sure you understand.

121
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,000
It's... been an honor... being
your faithful assistant.

122
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,530
Sounds good.

123
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,650
She said it was okay.

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
- Really?
- Really?

125
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,750
So with Twilight's blessing,

126
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,340
I am free to follow my code
and serve you until...

127
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,800
Well, until... forever!

128
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,580
Listen, sugar cube, I completely
respect your Dragon Code,

129
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,200
truly I do, but I just can't cotton
with you permanently serving me.

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,260
Please, Applejack.
My Dragon Code is a part of me!

131
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,530
I have to be true to myself!

132
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,620
If you don't let me do this,
I won't be a noble dragon anymore!

133
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,590
Oh. Well, I can't have you feeling like
you're not a noble dragon, now can I?

134
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,790
Great! Then from here on in,
your wish is my command.

135
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,100
Huh. Okay...

136
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,180
I would like you to...

137
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,770
Help me take some of the pie
you made to--

138
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,110
Rarity?

139
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,800
Sure. Why not?

140
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,110
I helped bake it!

141
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,850
You even look good
when you're chewing!

142
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,480
Who looks good
when they're chewing?

143
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,520
Aren't you gonna have some more?

144
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,270
I had a big lunch!

145
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,020
It's 10 in the morning.

146
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,190
Breakfast.
A big breakfast.

147
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,710
Oh. Okay!

148
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,360
Maybe you could take her plate
back to the kitchen and wash it off?

149
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,050
As you wish!

150
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,950
What was that all about?

151
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,460
I saved Spike from some Timberwolves
in the Everfree Forest

152
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,630
and now he thinks
he has to serve me forever!

153
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,130
What I wouldn't give to have
some pony forever in my debt!

154
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,900
I'd get them to organize my closets,

155
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,300
and give me pedicures
and help me with my sewing--

156
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,560
Okay, I get it.

157
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,740
Having somepony to do things
for you would be a dream come true.

158
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,000
But I don't feel right having Spike
thinking he owes me something.

159
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,160
And you tasted that pie.
Sometimes his help isn't that helpful.

160
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,560
Do you have a broom I could borrow?

161
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,900
A.J., Rarity!
What's happening?

162
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,070
Applejack saved Spike's life
and now he has to serve her forever.

163
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,550
Sweet!

164
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
What are you having him do?

165
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,100
Wash your laundry?
Clean your room?

166
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,550
Help you with
your unfinished novel?

167
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,270
Mine's about this awesome Pegasus

168
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,750
who's the best flyer ever and becomes
the captain of the Wonderbolts!

169
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,260
How ever did you come up with that
ingeniously woven, intricate plot line?

170
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,780
Just came to me.

171
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,350
Thing is I don't really want him
to serve me forever.

172
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,200
But I don't know how
to get him to stop.

173
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,010
That's easy!

174
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,850
Just make him help you with
something really, really hard!

175
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,340
I don't know.

176
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,810
I don't want him to get hurt!

177
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,230
Please!

178
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,000
He'll quit way before there's
even a chance of getting hurt!

179
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,920
Leave this to me.

180
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,740
So, Spike,

181
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,950
Applejack was gonna
help me stack some hay

182
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,890
so I could practice smashing
through it,

183
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,900
but I'm feeling extra,
extra powerful today.

184
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,700
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

185
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,380
So instead of hay,
I'm gonna smash through rocks!

186
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,800
- Rocks?
- Yeah, a huge tower of rocks!

187
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,550
And you're gonna build it!

188
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,230
- I am?
- Yeah, I mean,

189
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,250
unless you don't want
to help Applejack...

190
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,800
I do!
It is Spike's Dragon Code!

191
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,520
Then get to it!

192
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,900
Trust me.
This is gonna work like a charm!

193
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,200
I was sure he'd give up
after like three rocks.

194
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,490
Oh, goodness.
If it'd been me,

195
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,250
I'd have just pretended I didn't
have anything for him to do.

196
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,900
Why didn't I think of that?

197
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,650
Is this high enough?

198
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,870
That's plenty high.
Come on down, Spike.

199
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,020
Bad news: he actually ended up
building the whole rock tower!

200
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,930
Good news:

201
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,380
I've got a rock tower
to knock down!

202
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,510
You can do it!

203
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,020
All right! Yeah!

204
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,110
That was awesome!

205
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,030
Wanna do it again,
Rainbow Dash?

206
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,700
Applejack can re-build it for ya!

207
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,480
And when I say "Applejack",
I of course mean me.

208
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,320
Sure. Why not?

209
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,620
No!

210
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,910
I mean, I don't think Rainbow Dash
needs any more of your help.

211
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,560
My help.
She doesn't need it!

212
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,080
Right, Rainbow Dash?

213
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,100
Yeah.
I guess I'm good.

214
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,850
- For now.
- And so am I.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,590
I just can't think of one more
thing I need help with.

216
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,490
So you don't have
to do anything else!

217
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,510
What do you mean you can't think
of anything else I can help with?

218
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,150
Exactly that.
There's nothing else.

219
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,680
I don't want you to do anything.

220
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,980
If I don't help you,
how will I know I'm a noble dragon?

221
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,230
Well, huh--

222
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,540
Maybe there's things
you need help with

223
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,410
that you don't even realize
you need help with!

224
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,600
If she needed help,
I think she'd realize it.

225
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,860
Maybe not!

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,830
Maybe Applejack needs help
realizing what she needs help with!

227
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,490
Like, maybe your back itches.

228
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,970
That does feel good!

229
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,480
See?

230
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,100
Or... you might need help
remembering your favorite song!

231
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,440
<i>The dragon is
the finest creature ever</i>

232
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,940
<i>There's more to him
than just guarding treasure...</i>

233
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't think
that's her favorite--

234
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,060
Or... you might
need help breathing!

235
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,320
Breathing?
I certainly do not--

236
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,590
See? There are plenty of things
I can help you with.

237
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,060
And you don't even have
to trouble yourself with thinking of them.

238
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,900
No. I'll think of them!
Let me think of them!

239
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,600
As you wish!

240
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,290
Twilight?
Twilight are you there?

241
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,670
Twilight!

242
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,650
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

243
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,270
No, it's okay.

244
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,750
I need to take a break anyway.

245
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,910
What's going on?

246
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,900
I know Spike told you that
he was gonna follow his Dragon Code

247
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,300
and serve me forever for saving
him from the Timberwolves,

248
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,630
and that you were okay
with it, but--

249
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,470
Wait. What?

250
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,680
He said he told you
all about it.

251
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,760
I'm guessing maybe you were
a little distracted when he told you.

252
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,230
Maybe a little.

253
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,260
Should've realized you wouldn't
have let him go so easily.

254
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,900
Well, now that you know
what's going on,

255
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,490
maybe you could talk
some sense into him.

256
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,620
Oh, Applejack, I wish I could,

257
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,700
but this is the Dragon Code
we're talking about.

258
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,870
Surely you know how important
the Dragon Code is to a dragon?

259
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,410
I sure am starting to...

260
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,400
There's only one other way Spike

261
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,000
is gonna fulfill the debt
he feels he owes you.

262
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,680
Seventy,

263
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:13,090
71, 72, 73, 74, 75...

264
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,510
All right, y'all,
here's the deal,

265
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,390
Spike needs to save my life.

266
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,540
And you want us to shoot you out
of a cannon toward a hornet's nest,

267
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,700
and give Spike a butterfly net
so he can catch you mere seconds

268
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,610
before you hit the nest and are stung
by a thousand angry hornets!

269
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,090
I'll wear this moustache.

270
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,170
No.

271
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,560
I am gonna be attacked
by a Timberwolf!

272
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,970
Can I still wear
the moustache?

273
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,090
When I give the signal,
Pinky Pie and Rarity

274
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,540
will come running out of the woods,
being pursued by the Timberwolf.

275
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,920
I'll start to run too,

276
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,010
but then pretend to get
my hoof stuck.

277
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,740
I'll ask Spike
to help me dislodge it.

278
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,510
And he will and I'll be able to get away
from the terrifying Timberwolf.

279
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
Having saved me
from certain doom,

280
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,580
Spike will then
consider us even!

281
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,640
Everybody get it?

282
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,450
I'll do my best!

283
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,570
Just one question.

284
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,350
Yes?

285
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,520
No.

286
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,030
Suit yourself.

287
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,850
We're all ready
to play our parts,

288
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,370
but are you sure you're ready
to play yours, Applejack?

289
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,460
What do you mean?

290
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,540
Show us your best
damsel in distress move.

291
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,220
How's this?

292
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,190
Absolutely horrendous!

293
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,690
Okay, this needs
some serious work!

294
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,320
Now, first you must lift your foreleg up
to your forehead like so.

295
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,770
<i>Applejack!</i>

296
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,270
No time.
Here he comes!

297
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,720
Uh, over here, Spike!

298
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,250
You said you had something else
you needed me to do?

299
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,940
Oh. Yes, I was just hoping
you could maybe, uh,

300
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,530
sweep up all those leaves
for a compost pile.

301
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,480
But, of course.

302
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,060
Oh, by the way,

303
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:06,000
there are exactly 24,567,837
blades of grass at Sweet Apple Acres.

304
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,460
I can't believe you counted
every single one of them!

305
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,370
You asked me to.

306
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,150
And as a noble dragon and follower
of my Dragon Code, I--

307
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,810
That was very convincing!

308
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,640
Timberwolf!

309
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,430
We are doomed!

310
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,990
See? Like that.

311
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,300
Oh, no! I seem to have got
my hoof caught in between two rocks!

312
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,500
I cannot run away!

313
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,700
I am a damsel in distress!
Help me, Spike!

314
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,430
Wait a minute!

315
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,550
No, no.
Don't wait a minute!

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,780
Save me from
the terrifying Timberwolf!

317
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,120
Well, he would be terrifying
if he wasn't... a fake!

318
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,200
You got the clomping
of his claws.

319
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,000
The roar was spot on.

320
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,570
And the detail on his face
is pretty good.

321
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,210
But you forgot one thing.

322
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,250
His breath!

323
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
You can smell a real Timberwolf's
breath from a mile--

324
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,940
Too late!
I'm already on--

325
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,720
Timberwolf!

326
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,560
Timberwolf!

327
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,120
Applejack, come on!

328
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,840
I can't.
I'm really stuck!

329
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,550
No more messing around!

330
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,930
Let's go!

331
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,300
Come on!

332
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,080
Forget it, Spike.
You gotta get out of here!

333
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,330
Would you just forget
your Dragon Code already and go?

334
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,070
No!

335
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,710
I have to save you!

336
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,010
Let's get out of here!

337
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,010
What happened to you
guys back there?

338
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,440
Thought you were right behind us!

339
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,600
My hoof was stuck and that Timberwolf
was coming right at me!

340
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,980
Wait, you were actually stuck?

341
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,990
But Spike picked up a pebble,

342
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,110
and rocketed that thing right
at the huge Timberwolf's mouth!

343
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,960
And saved my life!

344
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,870
Ah, it was nothing.

345
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,400
It was something all right!

346
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,890
'Course I wouldn't have needed help
if I hadn't been trying to stage a fake

347
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,050
Timberwolf attack
in the first place.

348
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,550
Yeah.
What was that all about?

349
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,980
I know this code thing's
important to you,

350
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,130
but if something like this
comes up in the future,

351
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,000
think maybe we can
go back to my code,

352
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,390
say that's what friends do,
and leave it at that?

353
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,250
I promise I won't think
of you as any less noble.

354
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,320
Sounds good to me.

355
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,660
But maybe let's just try
to avoid situations where one of us

356
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,770
actually needs help the other one
to save their life?

357
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,530
You got yourself a deal!

358
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,880
- Thanks, Spike.
- Happy to help!

359
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,910
Don't know what I'd do
without you.

360
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
No, really.

361
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,550
I'm really, really, really
happy to help you!
