come on the right day.

157
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:13,367
Your parties sound
simply divine.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,828
We're so lucky to
have you here.

159
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,370
Just doin' my job,
little fillies.

160
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,099
<i>I mean, Pinkie Pie's parties</i>

161
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:21,424
<i>are fun and sweet and all,</i>

162
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,551
but now this
party's gonna be...

163
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:24,476
...epic?

164
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:25,771
You said it!

165
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,662
No offense, Pinkie.

166
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,047
None taken.

167
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:55,890
My birth-aversary's
already lookin' way cooler!

168
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:59,523
You are my kind of party
pony, Cheese Sandwich!

169
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:01,968
You got that right,
Rainbow Dash!

170
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,927
All right, party ponies!

171
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,341
I've got some planning to do!

172
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,001
<i>Pinkie!</i>

173
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:20,579
Aren't you going to help
Cheese Sandwich plan the party?

174
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:21,925
That's OK. Heh heh.

175
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:25,153
He obviously has what it
takes to do it all by himself.

176
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:26,979
Really?

177
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,131
Yes, indeedy!

178
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:40,076
After all, if Cheese really
is the super-duperest

179
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,633
partyingest pony of them all,

180
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:43,795
maybe that means...

181
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:46,076

my first party ever!

194
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:05,356
My whole family was there!

195
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:08,298
And that's Twilight's
Welcome to Ponyville party!

196
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,958
She didn't even expect
that one. 

197
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,214
Oh, look at Gummy. He
just looks so excited

198
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:15,551
for his birthday party.

199
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:17,931
Mmmm...Shining Armour
and Cadence's wedding

200
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,157
sure was special...

party-planning expertise,
Cheese Sandwich.

218
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,341
Well, they don't call
him the super-duper

219
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,625
Party Planner for nothin'!

220
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,527
That's it! This pony has got
to get her title back!

221
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,178
And I know just what to do!

222
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:39,609
Totally Awesome!

223
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,618
<i>Best I've ever seen.</i>

224
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,460
I can't believe it.

225
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,199
<i>Freeze, Cheese!</i>

226
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,061
I challenge you...

227
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:54,833
to a GOOF-OFF!

228
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:57,258
Oh no!

229
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,012
Not a Goof-Off!

230
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,088
What's a Goof-Off?

231
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,364
I have no idea.

232
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:07,363
This Cheese has stood alone
a long time, Pinkie Pie.

233
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:10,704
You think you
can out-goof me?

234
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:12,458
Oh, I don't think so.

235
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,333
I KNOW SO!

236
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:17,057
And the stakes are
high, Cheese Sandwich.

237
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:20,813
Whoever wins will be dubbed the
ultimate Super Duper Party Pony

238
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:24,320
and headline the Rainbow
Dash Birth-Aversary Bash!

239
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:25,467
And the loser?

240
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:26,735
DOESN'T!

241
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,418
So, are you in, Cheese?

242
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,779
Or are you boneless?

243
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,675
Nopony calls me boneless!

244
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:38,044
Right Boneless?

245
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:42,593
Then the Goof-Off
is on for High Noon!

246
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:45,600
Um, Pinkie? It's already 3:00.

247
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:50,657
Oh, well then. Make
it 3:10 to Goof-Off!

248
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:11,652
All right, everypony!

249
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,372
According to my official
Goof-Off Rule Book...

250
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:17,221
She actually has a
Goof-Off Rule Book?

251
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:18,846
Are you kidding?

252
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,607
Twilight can find a rule
book for everything.

253
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,386
Shhh.

254
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:25,843
The two competitors have
free range to Goof About,

255
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,667
be it by singing, dancing,
playing, prancing, joking,

256
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:31,436
or performing to make the
Judge chortle, chuckle, giggle,

257
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,128
guffaw, hoot and holler,
whoop it up, and party down!

258
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:38,671
The funnier, sillier, wilder,
and goofier, the better.

259
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,828
Rainbow Dash, since the winner
will be headlining your party,

260
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:43,426
you are the Judge.

261
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:47,744
Henh. Big, tense competition
on my birth-aversary.

262
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:49,539
What could be better?

263
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:54,774
Cheese Sandwich? Pinkie
Pie? Are you ready?

264
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,055
I was born ready!

265
00:13:57,752 --> 00:14:00,052
I was ready before I was born!

266
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:04,156
Then...let the goofing begin!

00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,480
But I haven't named a winner.

309
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,923
You don't have to.

310
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:23,752
I forfeit.

311
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,607
Which means, Cheese
Sandwich wins!

312
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,287
Ha ha ha! ... I do?

313
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,301
Yes, you get to headline
Rainbow Dash's party.

314
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,477
But what about
you, Pinkie?

315
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:40,860
I...I don't!

316
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,651
Pinkie, wait!

317
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:56,119
I'm sorry I got all swept
away by Cheese Sandwich.

318
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:57,806
We all are.

319
00:16:58,122 --> 00:16:59,361
<i>Don't know what</i>

320
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,580
Sorry, Pinkie.

321
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:04,956
No, I'm sorry I let my
pride get in the way

322
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:07,582
<i>of you having the best</i>
<i>birth-aversary ever.</i>

323
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:11,205
Cheese Sandwich really is a
Super Duper Party Planner

324
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,032
and he'll be a
terrific headliner.

325
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,644
I should have been a big
enough pony to admit that

326
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:17,242
and let you have your day.

327
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:19,338
But don't you get it?

328
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,959
You're both Super
Duper Party Ponies!

329
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:25,231
Sure, Cheese Sandwich is
a great guest party pony.

330
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:28,152
But you're Ponyville's
permanent party pony!

331
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:31,121
Nopony could ever
take your place

332
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:33,672
and we could never have
a party without you!

<i>Rainbow Dash is right.</i>

334

I never meant to take
your place in Ponyville.

335
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:43,986
I just wanted to show you what
a great party pony I am, Pinkie.

336
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,404
