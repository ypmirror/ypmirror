1
00:00:01,911 --> 00:00:04,812
Oh, Opalescence. Can you just picture it?

2
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:10,372
Moi, stepping up in astounding new gown
at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!

3
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:17,052
Why, yes! I did make it myself.

4
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:19,296
Thank you so much for asking.

5
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:29,199
Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you.

6
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,577
What's that? You wanna help me more!

7
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:38,093
Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?

8
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:45,642
Careful now. Don't move.
This shouldn't take long at all.

9
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:32,670
Howdy, Rarity?

10
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:36,543
Shh... Can't you see Rarity
is trying to concentrate?

11
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:39,986
What do you think she's makin'?

12
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:41,471
Looks like a dress.

13
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:45,777
Well, that makes sense.
Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,706
Is there something I can help you with?

15
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:52,931
Oh, so very sorry to trouble you,
Rarity, but I need a quick favor.

16
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:59,285
Could you please fix the button for me?
It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.

17
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,376
Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing.

18
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,986
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala.

19
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:11,501
And I'll make it for you. No problem at all.
It will be my pleasure!

20
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:16,164
Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer,
Rarity, but I can't let you do that.

21
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:19,242
It would be so much work. This dress is fine.

22
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:23,256
Twilight Sparkle.
I insist on making you a new dress.

23
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,800
-But...
-No no, not a word!

24
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,102
I won't take no for an answer.

25
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,408
Well, in that case... Thank you
for your generosity, Rarity.

26
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,088
Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure
it will be absolutely beautiful.

27
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:41,049
Let me guess, Applejack.
You don't want a new gown either.

28
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,411
Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna
wear my old work duds.

29
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:48,136
You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!

30
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:50,685
You absolutely must wear formal attire.

31
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:54,061
Nah.

32
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:59,124
What if I just spruce up your...
duds for you a little bit?

33
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,888
Okay, sure. Why not?
Since you're up for it and all.

34
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,981
Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.

35
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:06,744
Deal!

36
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:08,484
Look out below!

37
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:15,619
Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.

38
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,059
Idea!

39
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:24,782
I'll make you an outfit for
the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,478
Outfit for the what now?

41
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:31,669
I'll make one for you and you and all of you.

42
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,960
Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too.

43
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:37,338
Oh, and when I'm done, we can
hold our very own fashion show!

44
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,760
What a great idea!
If you're sure you can handle it.

45
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:45,117
Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it
will be a wonderful boost for my business.

46
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,667
Plus, fun!

47
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:48,550
Oh, I love fun things!

48
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:53,544
Then it's settled.
We'll have a fashion show starring us.

49
00:03:56,483 --> 00:04:01,320
So all you have to do is make a
different, stunnin', original...

50
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:06,235
...amazin' outfit for one, two, three, four,
five... plus yourself, six ponies?

51
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:07,732
And lickety split?

52
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:10,360
Oh, Applejack.

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,475
You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,602
<i>Thread by thread, stitching it together</i>

00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:54,528
<i>Gotta mind those intimate details</i>

66
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,770
<i>Even though she's more concerned with sales</i>

67
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:02,169
<i>It's Applejack's new dress</i>

68
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:07,434
<i>Dressmaking's easy

<i>Fluttershy something breezy</i>

70
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:12,204
<i>Blend color and form...</i>
Do you think it looks cheesy?

71
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:19,530
<i>Something brash, perhaps quite fetching</i>

72
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:23,566

That's it. Keep them closed.

84
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:02,236
Don't look.

85
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,008
Okay, you can look now!

86
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:08,598
These are your new outfits.

87
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:14,516
What do you think of your old duds now,
Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not?

88
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:17,401
And Twilight! I made this dress for you...

89
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:22,149
...and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly
reflect each pony's unique personality.

90
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:26,631
Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right
on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it.

91
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:29,340
Oh, and it turned out
BEAUTIFUL, don't you think?

92
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:34,045
Ooo, and I know you are going to love
yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring!

93
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:38,076
And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite!

94
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:40,648
Aren't they all amazing?

95
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:49,259
Wow...

96
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,524
-They're...
-Yeah, they're...

97
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,496
They sure are...

98
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,655
-...sumth'n.
-Yes! Something.

99
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:58,831
I love something! Something is my favorite!

100
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,708
It's... nice.

101
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:02,987
But what's the matter? Don't you like them?

102
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,491
They're very nice...

103
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:07,961
And we're plum grateful, cause
you worked so hard on them.

104
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,338
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.

105
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,849
She asked.

106
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:18,241
I guess what we're all saying is that
they're just not what we had in mind.

107
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,886
That's okay. Not a problem.

108
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,641
There's plenty more where that came from.

109
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,884
They were only a first pass.

110
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:31,664
You're my friends and I want
you to be 110% satisfied.

111
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:34,443
Not to worry, I'll redo them.

112
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:38,174
Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that.
They're fine.

113
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:40,498
I want them to be better that just fine.

114
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:43,549
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.

115
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,455
Are you sure?
I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.

116
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:50,205
Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.

117
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,633
Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity.

118
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:02,322
What have I gotten myself into?

119
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:08,858
Hello?

120
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,839
You wanted to see me, Rarity?

121
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:13,641
Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready.

122
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:16,642
I completely revised it and
I know you're going to love it.

123
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,715
What do you think?

124
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:21,769
I...

125
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:23,093
...love it.

126
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,214
Oh, you're just saying that.

127
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:27,121
No, no. I do.

128
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:28,999
It's... nice.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,296
"Nice"?

130
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:31,232
Nice.

131
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,331
If you don't like it, you should just tell me.

132
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,910
Oh, but I do like it.

133
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:37,606
Like it or love it?

134
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,200
Um... both?

135
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,089
Which is it?

136
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,132
Please stop asking me this, I...

137
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,819
Well, just tell me what you really think.

138
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,000
No, that's okay...

139
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:45,976
Tell me.

140
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:47,625
No... it's fine...

141
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,509
Tell me!

142
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,215
I... like it...

143
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:52,520
Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!

144
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:55,500
All right! Since you really wanna know...

145
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:59,444
The armscye's tight, the middy collar
doesn't go with the shawl lapel...

146
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:03,013
...the hems are clearly machine-stitched,
the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile...

147
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:06,764
...you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a
topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch...

148
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:10,586
...and the overdesign is reminiscent of
prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture.

149
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:16,305
But, uh... you know...
um, whatever you want to do is fine.

150
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,733
Now, the stars on my belt need
to be technically accurate.

151
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:24,929
Orion has three stars on his belt, not four.

00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:41,892
<i>Wait until you see it in the light</i>

158
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:46,184
<i>I'm sewing them together!</i>

159
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,125
Don't you think my gown would be
more "me" with some lollipops?

160
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:50,799
-Well, I think...
-Balloons?

161
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,622
-Well...
-DO EET!

162
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:56,179
<i>Hour by hour, one more change</i>

163
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,275
<i>I'm sewing them together, take great pains</i>

164
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,935
<i>Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind</i>

165
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,115
<i>Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?</i>

166
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:07,157
<i>Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time</i>

167
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:12,693
<i>Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine</i>

168
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,736
<i>Dressmaking's easy
Every customer's call</i>

169
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:18,743
<i>Brings a whole new revision</i>

170
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,548
<i>Have to pick up the pace
Still hold to my vision</i>

171
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:26,127
That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.

172
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,229
French haute couture, please.

173
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,366
What if it rains? Galoshes!

174
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:38,283
More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons.

175
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,734
More candy! Oh, less candy.

176
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:42,873
Oh wait, I know. Streamers!

177
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:45,966
-Streamers?
-Whose dress is this?

178
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,802
Streamers it is.

179
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:52,124
What?

180
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,109
Aren't you going to tell me
to change something too?

181
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:56,991
No, I just want my dress to be cool.

182
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,462
Do you not like the color?

183
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:01,276
The color's fine, just make it look cooler.

184
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:02,319
Do you not like the shape?

185
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,992
The shape's fine, just make
the whole thing... you know, cooler.

186
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:08,752
It needs to be about 20% cooler.

187
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:12,115
<i>All we ever want is indecision</i>

188
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,067
<i>All we really like is what we know</i>

189
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:16,129
<i>Gotta balance style with adherence</i>

190
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,029
<i>Making sure we make a good appearance</i>

191
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,062
<i>Even if you simply have to fudge it</i>

192
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,094
<i>Make sure that it stays within our budget</i>

193
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:24,291
<i>Got to overcome intimidation</i>

194
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:28,413
<i>Remember, it's all in the presentation!</i>

195
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:31,042
<i>Piece by piece, snip by snip</i>

196
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:33,089
<i>Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip</i>

197
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,220
<i>Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed</i>

198
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:37,236
<i>Yard by yard, always stressed</i>

199
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:43,284
<i>And that's the Art of the Dress!</i>

200
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,573
Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest
dresses I've ever made.

201
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:59,218
Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for.

202
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,455
Now don't hold back.

203
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:02,390
Let me know what you really think.

204
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:05,892
-Oh my!
-It's... perfect!
-It's cool!

205
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,989
Wow. They're the best duds I ever did see.

206
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,939
It's exactly what I asked for!

207
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,107
Thank you, Rarity.

208
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:16,881
Are you as happy with the as we're?

209
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:21,754
Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy.

210
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,356
I'm just relieved to finally be done.

211
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,727
You are never gonna believe this!

212
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:30,096
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?

213
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:32,639
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?

214
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,166
Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show.

215
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,003
Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him...

216
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:40,836
He's coming here all the way from
Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!

217
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:42,819
Whoa, Nelly!

218
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,167
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.

219
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,152
You business will be boomin'!

220
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:53,076
Hoity-Toity?
He's coming here?

221
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:55,709
To see THESE dresses?

222
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:59,549
Yep! Get ready for all
of your dreams to come true.

223
00:13:10,632 --> 00:13:11,531
There he is!

224
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,309
Okay. Relax, Rarity.

225
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,272
Your friends like their outfits and so will he.

226
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:32,796
What's wrong with the lights?!

227
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:36,497
Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good.

228
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:51,524
Since the beginning of time the elite
of Equestria have longed for pony fashions...

229
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:56,033
...that that truly expressed the
essence of their very souls.

230
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:01,688
Patiently waiting decades... no, centuries!
...for the perfect pony gown.

231
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:05,974
Today at long last, Equestria, your wait is over!

232
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:10,891
Let's hear it for the breathtaking
designs of Ponyville's own...

233
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:12,244
Rarity!

234
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:36,373
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?

235
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:40,838
Oh dear.

236
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:43,083
You think we overdid it?

237
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,412
Nah.

238
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:49,105
Okay, maybe a little.

239
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:54,735
Oh, those amateurish designs look like a piled-on
mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink!

240
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:00,936
It's a travesty, it's what it is.

241
00:15:00,937 --> 00:15:04,931
Those outfits are the ugliest things
I've ever seen, oh for shame.

242
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:08,714
Who is responsible for subjecting
our eyes to these horrors?

243
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:11,275
Not to mention wasting my valuable time.

244
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,122
Hide me.

245
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,762
Come on out and take a bow, Rarity.
You worked really hard for this.

246
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:20,273
Yes! Alright, woohoo! Go, Rarity!

247
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,052
Rarity? You okay in there?

248
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,969
You haven't come out for days.

249
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,889
I'm never coming out! I can't
show my face in Ponyville ever again!

250
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:45,514
I used to be somepony. I used to be respected.

251
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:48,526
I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses!

252
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:51,612
But now everypony is laughing at me.

253
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,721
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!

254
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,219
You're not a laughingstock, Rarity...

255
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,869
-She kind of is.
-Shhh!

256
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:01,496
Come on out and talk to us.

257
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:05,454
Leave me alone!

258
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:09,374
I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in...

259
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:11,929
...whatever it is that ponies
are supposed to wallow in!

260
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:13,495
Do ponies wallow in pity?

261
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:17,751
Oh, listen to me, I don't even know
what I'm supposed to wallow in!

262
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:21,019
I'M SO PATHETIC!

263
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:23,404
Now what do we do?

264
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:25,363
Panic?

265
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:26,770
That's your answer for everything!

266
00:16:26,771 --> 00:16:29,009
Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.

267
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,176
She'll become a crazy cat lady!

268
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:32,714
She only has one cat.

269
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:34,176
Give her time...

270
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:42,267
Exile...

271
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:46,280
I guess technically I'd have to
move away to live in exile.

272
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,757
Where would I go? And what would I pack?

273
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,319
Oh, it's going to take me forever
to do all of that packing.

274
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,751
What are you supposed to pack
when you go into exile?

275
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,631
Are you supposed to pack warm?

276
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:57,781
Opal?

277
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,519
Opal, how did you get up there?

278
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,906
Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!

279
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:13,324
Rainbow Dash?!

280
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:16,450
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.

281
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:19,710
Well, how else were we gonna get
you out here to show you...

282
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,111
...this!

283
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,331
What is it? It's not... You...

284
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,877
We all finished your dress for you.

285
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:31,756
Thanks to Fluttershy's
freaky knowledge of sewing.

286
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,038
Do you like it?

287
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,206
Like it?

288
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:38,795
Like it?!

289
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:41,225
Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.

290
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,634
No, I don't like it.

291
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:47,883
I LOVE IT!

292
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:54,380
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.

293
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,154
We just followed your brilliant design.

294
00:17:57,513 --> 00:17:59,997
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.

295
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:02,976
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.

296
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:05,641
We're so super sorry.

297
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:10,089
You worked really hard to make our
dresses exactly the way we wanted them.

298
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,567
We all saw how well that turned out.

299
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,771
Oh, I forgive you.

300
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:17,020
Well, that's mighty big of you.

301
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:20,488
But my whole career is still ruined!

302
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:22,971
Oh, right. That.

303
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,589
Maybe not.

304
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,134
All right, I haven't got all day.

305
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,165
Take two.

306
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:56,722
Hello...

307
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:58,846
Oh, this can't be the same designer.

308
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:13,707
Simply magnificent!

309
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:16,782
And suddenly I have a fresh craving
for some Dutch apple pie...

310
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:19,789
Candied apples on a stick?
Apple turnovers? Apple cobbler?

311
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,349
Brilliant!

312
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:55,558
Oh, spectacular!

313
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,872
Now this is a fashion show.

314
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:15,275
All of these dresses are absolutely amazing.

315
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:19,461
Who is responsible?
Step forward, show yourself!

316
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,771
Bravo! Bravo!

317
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:29,692
Magnifico! Encore!

318
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,577
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

319
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:36,158
Oh, thank you so much!

320
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:38,939
"Dear Princess Celestia."

321
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,603
"This week my very talented
friend Rarity learned..."

322
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:45,910
"...that if you try to please everypony,
you oftentimes end up pleasing nopony."

323
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,506
"Especially yourself."

324
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,304
"And I learned this:"

325
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:52,107
"When somepony offers to do you a favor..."

326
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,434
"...like making you a beautiful dress..."

327
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:58,005
"...you shouldn't be overly critical
of something generously given to you."

328
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,481
"In other words, you shouldn't
look a gift horse in the mouth."

329
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:13,373
Rarity, my congratulations.
You are the most impressive fashion maven.

330
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:18,311
Would you do me the great honor
of allowing me to feature your couture...

331
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:21,510
...in my best of the best boutique in Canterlot?

332
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:27,258
Now, I'll need you to make a dozen
of each dress for me by next Tuesday.
