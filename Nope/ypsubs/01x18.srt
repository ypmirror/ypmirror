1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,365
Where are you takin' us?

2
00:00:04,582 --> 00:00:06,093
We're almost there, young 'uns.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,841
I've never been here before.

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,269
Ouch!

5
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:14,859
Oh. Sorry.

6
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:16,158
Are we there yet?

7
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:19,865
There? Where? What?
I don't even know what we're doing.

8
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:21,184
Here we are.

9
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:22,451
What are we lookin' at?

10
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,410
I have no idea.

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,895
What is that thing?

12
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:30,282
Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome
to your new clubhouse.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,207
Well, don't thank me all at once.

14
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,794
This was my clubhouse when I was your age.

15
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:42,513
Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but...

16
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:45,366
...it's empty and on a secluded
private part of the farm.

17
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:47,221
And it's all yours.

18
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,970
It just needs a little, uh... TLC.

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,504
TLC as in Tender Loving Care
or Totally Lost Cause?

20
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:59,103
Applejack! We're supposed to turn
this into our new clubhouse?

21
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:03,170
Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks
when you discover your talent for...

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,150
...house cleanin'?

23
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,607
Wow! Hi, Scootaloo!

24
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:41,737
Back already? You're 'mazin' on that scooter.

25
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:44,117
Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom.

26
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:45,999
You did all of this?

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,022
Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off
the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted...

28
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:54,385
That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to?

29
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:58,773
<i>We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders...</i>

30
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:06,177
<i>...never stop the journey...</i>

31
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,349
There you are, Sweetie Belle!

32
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:14,050
See? I told you we could find her
by followin' her totally awesome voice.

33
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,946
What's that sweet tune you're singing?

34
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:20,139
Oh. I was just working on our new
Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,774
COOL!

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,098
Teach us?

37
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:25,723
Well, I've only come up with one part...

38
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:26,995
...but okay!

39
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:31,040
<i>They all say that you will get your mark</i>

40
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,994
<i>When the time is really right</i>

41
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:39,491
<i>And you know just what you're supposed to do</i>

42
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:42,495
<i>AND YOUR TALENT COMES TO LIGHT!</i>

43
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:48,912
Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders.
You've done one fine job with this place.

44
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:50,383
So, what's next?

45
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,109
Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse...

46
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,948
And a map of Ponyville.

47
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,336
And a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.

48
00:03:57,623 --> 00:03:58,477
Theme song?

49
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:01,175
We're gonna go out in the world
and discover our talents.

50
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,713
A new adventure!

51
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:04,633
And earn our cutie marks.

52
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,342
We'll leave no stone unturned!

53
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:08,309
No mountain unclimbed!

54
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,028
No meal uncooked!

55
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:11,591
No sock unwarmed!

56
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:15,271
Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan.

57
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:16,569
I gotta, uh...

58
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:19,141
Leave no apple unpicked!

59
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,511
See y'all later!

60
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:23,889
Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?

61
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:25,320
Ready!

62
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:22,746
I had nothing to do with this.

63
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,297
What is going on here?

64
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,430
Well, we sure aren't gettin'
our cutie marks for bein' librarians.

65
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:30,267
Huh. I should think not.

66
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:31,664
What?

67
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:34,398
Girls, I think you're going
about this the wrong way.

68
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,985
Instead of trying to do things
in areas you're not familiar with...

69
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:39,473
...why not try doing things
in areas that you already like?

70
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:42,304
And I have the perfect place to start.

71
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,982
"Showcase your talents..."

72
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,141
"...for all to see..."

73
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:50,093
"Perform in the Ponyville school talent show."

74
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,037
There'll be all sorts of awards.

75
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,536
Best dramatic performance,
best comedy act, best magic act...

76
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,568
Surely you can find your talent.

77
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:00,819
This *would* be the perfect place
to discover our talents.

78
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,621
-Jugglin'!
-Acting!
-Magic tricks!

79
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:06,920
-Square dancin'!
-Tightrope walking!
-Tiger taming!

80
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,712
My little ponies! You're missing the point.

81
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:12,676
Think about the things you already enjoy doing.

82
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:14,805
Think about what you're already good at.

83
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,569
Sure! We can do that.

84
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,271
Yeah! Sure we can.

85
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:20,901
Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as...

86
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,776
...The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

87
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:34,192
Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things.

88
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,383
Come back with my supplies!

89
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,701
We're just borrowing them for the talent show.

90
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:42,224
Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back.

91
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,563
Thanks, Mr. Breezy.
We'll return the fan to you real soon.

92
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,014
What do we need this fan for?

93
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,598
Trust me on this one.

94
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:59,134
Okay, so that's six wooden planks,
4 by 8 plywood, a box of nails...

95
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,056
...four cans of paint and four brushes.
Anything else?

96
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:08,218
Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden
planks, 4 by 8 plywood, a box of nails...

97
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,146
...four cans of paint and four brushes.

98
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:17,186
"Ghost, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"?

99
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,420
Good heavens, girls.
What do you need a book like this for?

100
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,662
You'll see. Thanks, Twilight.

101
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,989
We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it.

102
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,645
What do you think they're up to?

103
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:30,965
I have no idea and I don't know if
I should be excited or scared to find out.

104
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:34,201
I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.

105
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:35,457
Me too.

106
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:38,036
Um... so what are we doing again?

107
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,940
A super awesome dramatic song
for the talent show, of course.

108
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:46,183
Right! With super-cool scenery.
And amazing costumes.

109
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:48,569
And mind-blowin' dance moves.

110
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,832
This is gonna be so amazing!

111
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,639
Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer.

112
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,764
What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd.

113
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,198
Twilight said to do something we like to do.

114
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,894
And I'd like to be like my big sister.

115
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,389
And she's a designer.

116
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:06,284
Fine then. You can do
the costumes and the scenery.

117
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,573
And Scootaloo, you're great
in maneuvers on your scooter.

118
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:11,360
So you should do the choreography.

119
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:13,455
You know, all those dance moves.

120
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,853
Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad.

121
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:23,144
Why don't you come up with
the dance routine, Apple Bloom?

122
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,617
I'm not much of a dancer...

123
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:30,277
...but I do like Kung-fu.
That's kinda like dancin'.

124
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:37,776
Then it's settled! Let's get started.

125
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:46,398
One... two... three...

126
00:10:49,073 --> 00:10:51,611
Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing?

127
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:56,001
Oh, I feel like I have four left feet.

128
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:58,254
I can't even spin right.

129
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:03,192
Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head
forward until very the last minute. Like this.

130
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,394
See? Easy-peasy.

131
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,436
You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all.

132
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:14,163
Wow! That does look easy. Thanks.

133
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:16,802
Okay. Let's try this again.

134
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,129
I'm okay!

135
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,564
Keep practicing!

136
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:26,932
Will do.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,452
We fight the fight, walk the walk.

138
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:33,818
Talk the talk, eat a... uh...

139
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,500
...food like a celery stalk?

140
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,925
I'll never come up with anything!

141
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:42,685
Never, never, never!

142
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:47,265
Come back! Come back!

143
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,872
Dumb fabric.

144
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,569
Hey Scoot! How's the song going?

145
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:57,758
Oh my! Sounds serious.

146
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,865
I'm just no good at lyrics.
Coming up with words is, like...

147
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:04,035
...really hard.

148
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:06,080
Oh, it can't be that bad.

149
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:09,809
With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria.

150
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,291
We use our stomachs to... digestia?

151
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,917
Well... These are... um...

152
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:21,931
...good, but... How about after
"We fight the fight"...

153
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:25,418
<i>There is nothing that we fear</i>

154
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:29,628
<i>We'll have to figure out what we'll do next</i>

155
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,576
<i>Till our cutie marks are here</i>

156
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:36,408
Wow! That's so awesome!

157
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,191
Did you just come up with that now?

158
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,233
Yeah... kind of.

159
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,642
Thanks, I'm totally using that.

160
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:52,245
Oh no!

161
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:10,182
One, two, three, four, FIVE?!

162
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:18,517
How's the spin coming along?

163
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:21,148
I think I'll gotta just stick to punches and kicks.

164
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,163
You know, ponies only have four legs.

165
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:30,784
I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.

166
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,436
Hey, it's no big deal.

167
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,161
Why don't you use the dress form?

168
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:38,695
It'll help you with your patterns and help
you put all the pieces in the right places.

169
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:40,873
Oh, is that what that's for?

170
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:44,791
Uh... maybe you should also clean
your paintbrush between each color.

171
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:48,435
Oh, I was wondering why
all the colors looked like mud.

172
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:50,789
You're not using power tools, are you?

173
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:56,265
The talent show is just around the corner.
I wonder how the fillies are doin'.

174
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,088
-Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo.
-That's okay.

175
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,291
Ugh! Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo.

176
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,700
-Ouch!
-Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle.

177
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,672
Let's sing the chorus again!

178
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:13,375
Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.

179
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,374
I think that sounded pretty good.

180
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:17,697
Me too. You think we're ready?

181
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,594
Ready as we'll ever be.

182
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,325
Hey! Did you see us practicing?

183
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:24,190
Uh... Yeah.

184
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:26,114
Well? How do we do? How do we do?

185
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,987
Uh...

186
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:31,613
Speechless! See, girls?
I told you that's what we're gonna do.

187
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,986
We're gonna leave them speechless.

188
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:35,703
YAY!

189
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:37,822
"Speechless" is right.

190
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,557
...and on the count of three...

191
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:54,171
...this rabbit will disappear and something
tasty will reappear in its place.

192
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:57,263
A one, a two and a three!

193
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,346
Hey! Where are they?

194
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:01,808
Snails, where are the...

195
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,683
...carrots.

196
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,672
SNAILS!

197
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:13,367
Uh, how about a round of applause
for the S&S magic act?

198
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:19,721
Now for our next act we have Sunny Days and
Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem...

199
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,283
...on rollerskates!

200
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,395
Break a leg!

201
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,052
Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!

202
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:33,323
No, no, no. You see, in the theater
it's considered bad luck to say "good luck".

203
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:35,390
So you say "break a leg" instead.

204
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,899
My little ponies! How are you doing?

205
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:39,797
Nervous...

206
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:42,018
Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing.

207
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,258
Remember, just stick to what you know best.

208
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,715
I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.

209
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:50,228
Why does everypony always
think I'm gonna sing?

210
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:53,707
Actually, Twilight Sparkle,
I'm the main singer tonight.

211
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:57,884
And I'm the main dancer. Hai-ya!

212
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,269
And I'm in charge of...

213
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:02,710
Costumes?

214
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,507
And sets and props. How'd you know?

215
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,361
Really, girls? Are you sure...

216
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:11,701
Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next.
Break a leg.

217
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:13,417
-Break a le...
-Ugh!

218
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:14,904
Uh... good luck!

219
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:24,570
<i>Look, here are three little ponies</i>

220
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,105
<i>Ready to sing for this crowd</i>

221
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:31,860
<i>Listen up cause here's our story</i>

222
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:36,192
<i>I'm gonna sing it VERY LOUD!</i>

223
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:46,388
<i>When you're a younger pony</i>

224
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:49,869
<i>And your flank is very bare</i>

225
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,958
<i>Feels like the sun will never come</i>

226
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,909
<i>When your cutie mark's not there</i>

227
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:00,445
<i>So the three of us fight the fight</i>

228
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:04,129
<i>There is nothing that we fear</i>

229
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:08,403
<i>We'll have to figure out what we'll do next</i>

230
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:12,005
<i>Till our cutie marks are here</i>

231
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:16,610
<i>We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders</i>

232
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,604
<i>On a quest to find out who we are</i>

233
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:23,483
<i>And we will never stop the journey</i>

234
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:26,883
<i>Not until we have our cutie marks</i>

235
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:36,852
<i>They all say that you'll get your mark</i>

236
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:40,892
<i>When the time is really right</i>

237
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:44,879
<i>And you know just what you're supposed to do</i>

238
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,856
<i>And your talent comes to light</i>

239
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:51,738
<i>But it's not as easy as it sounds</i>

240
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:55,054
<i>And that waiting's hard to do</i>

241
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:59,347
<i>So we test our talents everywhere</i>

242
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:02,878
<i>Until our face is blue</i>

243
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:07,365
<i>We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders</i>

244
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,485
<i>On a quest to find out who we are</i>

245
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,696
<i>And we will never stop the journey</i>

246
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:17,699
<i>Not until we have our cutie marks</i>

247
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:21,767
<i>We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders</i>

248
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:24,915
<i>On a quest to find out who we are</i>

249
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:28,980
<i>And we will never stop the journey</i>

250
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:32,542
<i>Not until we have our cutie marks!</i>

251
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,549
Wow. That did not go as well as I expected.

252
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,061
I can't believe they're laughin' at us.

253
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:57,326
Was it that bad?

254
00:18:57,514 --> 00:19:00,714
Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards.

255
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,219
Back on stage? No.

256
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,341
They'll just laugh some more.

257
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,255
Yeah, what's the point?

258
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:09,793
Now girls, let's be good sports.

259
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:12,511
You made a great effort. You should be proud.

260
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:13,688
Now come on!

261
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:17,929
Let's hear it for all
our talented fillies and colts.

262
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,858
Our first award goes to...

263
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:26,235
Snips and Snails for best magic act.

264
00:19:29,763 --> 00:19:32,786
Hey! Mine's at least shinier.

265
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:34,571
Well, mine's bigger.

266
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,243
Oh yeah, well... Well, mine is, uh... heavier?

267
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,854
The next award goes to...

268
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:44,822
Sunny Days and Peachy Pie
for best dramatic performance.

269
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:50,712
And finally, the last award
of the night goes to...

270
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:57,780
The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

271
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,039
What?

272
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:01,364
For best comedy act.

273
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,530
Can you believe it? We won!

274
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,877
I knew our act was awesome.

275
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:20,571
You know what would be the best?

276
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,632
If we won *and* we got our cutie marks.

277
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:33,961
Congratulations, ponies! Job well done.

278
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:36,322
Thanks, Twilight.

279
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:38,881
Hey, you don't sound too excited.

280
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:44,748
We worked really hard and won a prize
but we still don't have our cutie marks.

281
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:47,883
Which is the prize we really wanted.

282
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:49,886
Oh, girls...

283
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,895
But we think we know why.

284
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:53,424
Yes. We know why.

285
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:57,845
Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make
a special report to the Princess.

286
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,127
Well, maybe we were trying too hard?

287
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,728
Yes? And...

288
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,722
And instead of forcing ourselves to
do something that's not meant for us...

289
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:09,479
Yes... Yes...

290
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,648
We each should be embracing our true talent!

291
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,304
And that is...?

292
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:16,539
Comedy!

293
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,230
Apple Bloom! You did it!

294
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,336
Did you see our award? Weren't we funny?

295
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:29,594
One day... One day...

296
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:35,492
