OK. Library... library... Where
did they put the library?

lot smaller from the outside.

00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,755

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,701
Whoops!

5
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:27,810
Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still
trying to find my way around.

6
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,596
You don't happen to know
where the library is, do you?

Oh. Thanks.

10

Acceptance, mm-hmm,
Altruism, definitely.

11
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,941
Starlight! Good
morning! Come in!

12
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,552
Sorry I'm late. I got
a little turned around.

13
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,520
I still can't believe you're
letting me stay here.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,025
As your pupil. After
everything I did.

15
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:55,170
Well, I'm not one to dwell on
the past and neither should you.

16
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:59,083
The castle is your home now and
as far as being my pupil goes...

17
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,552
I was just trying to figure out

18
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:02,414
what your first friendship
lesson should be!

19
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,520
Oh. Well, it looks like you're
really narrowing it down.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
Oh, these are just the As. After
this, I move on to the Bs!

Starlight: I know I'm just
learning about friendship,

23
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:58,727
but I didn't think there were
this many lessons for anything.

24
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,305
How do we choose?

25
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,163
Maybe I should pare things down
a bit before we go through them.

26
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,920
Why don't you join the
others in the throne room?

27
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:07,912
They're planning our trip
to the Crystal Empire

28
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:10,763
when Shining Armor and Princess
Cadance have their baby.

29
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:12,247
Throne room. Got it!

30
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:17,003
Um, which way is
the throne room?

31
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,872

32
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:21,803
Rainbow Dash: Well, I think
we should leave ASAP!

33
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,294
I don't want to miss
the Crystalling!

34
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:26,530
But, um, shouldn't we
wait for the invitation?

35
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:29,418
Frankly, I'm not exactly
clear on all the customs

36
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,243
and traditions of
the Crystal Empire.

37
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,505
Especially when it
comes to a Crystalling.

38
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:34,981
What's a Crystalling?

39
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,301
Well, that's just
it, Darling.

40
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,530
Princess Cadance and Shining
Armor's baby is due any day

41
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:42,429
and we're still not sure.

42
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:45,730
The Crystal Empire was
gone for a thousand years.

43
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:48,589
A lot of their customs
are a bit murky.

44
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:51,280
We know it's got something
to do with the new baby.

45
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:52,283
And a party!

46
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,905
And the Crystal Heart.

47
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:55,054
And a party!

48
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,207
And some kind of cool energy.

49
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,480
And...

50
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,152
A PARTY!

51
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,472
Spike: It's not
hard to understand.

52
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:06,909
Most things in the
Crystal Empire aren't.

53
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:11,032
Like how I'm a big hero
there, for example.

54
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:18,705
Plus, I've had to help Twilight

55
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,261
do a lot of research
on Crystallings.

56
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,890
Whenever a baby is born
in the Crystal Empire,

57
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,181
the parents bring it
before the Crystal Heart.

58
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:29,047
They get the purest shard
of crystal they can find,

59
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,505
then pick a Crystaller
to present the baby

60
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:33,141
to everypony who comes.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,247
Then they all share the
light and joy they feel,

62
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:38,785
feeding it into the crystal
that joins with the Heart

63
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,603
and increases its power.

64
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:43,600
And this is going to
be a Royal Crystalling,

65
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,941
so pretty much the whole
Empire will show up.

66
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,978
That hasn't happened
in a millennia.

67
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:52,203
What do you mean it increases
the Crystal Heart's power?

68
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:55,112
The energy it uses to protect
the Crystal Empire, I guess.

69
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,829
Protect it from what?

70
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:59,452
I didn't help Twilight
with that part.

71
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,612
Hey, Twilight, can
I ask you something

72
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,738
about the Crystal Empire?

73
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,083
Ha! Funny you
should mention it...

74
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,335
Because I just narrowed your
first friendship lesson

75
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:16,387
down to three options.

76
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,670
And one of them is in
the Crystal Empire.

77
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:19,852
Really?

78
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:22,227
I found out that's
where the first pony

79
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:23,520
you ever cared about lives!

80
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:24,941
Sunburst?

81
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,978
Of course that's just one idea.

82
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:28,603
We could also go to
Griffinstone.[voice fades]

83
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:31,470
Making friends with a Griffin
is a challenge all by itself.

84
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,507
Or we could tag
along with the CMCs

pony who can't figure out

86

What? Oh, no. Those
all sound great.

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,563
I know! I guess you
were right.

89
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,581
It is going to be
hard to choose one.

I don't know, Spike.

97
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:13,612
Twilight's figuring out what
my first friendship lesson is

98
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,064
and I guess I'm not exactly
thrilled with the options.

99
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:19,544
Well, with one of them.

100
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:20,609

101

Reuniting me with
my first friend.

When we were foals,

105

Sunburst knew everything there
was to know about magic.

106

110
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,556
I guess it's not surprising that
Sunburst got his cutie mark

111
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:15,230
in magic and went off to
Princess Celestia's school.

112
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,169
But when he left...

113
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,643
You blamed cutie marks and
stripped a whole village

114
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,249
of theirs and when Twilight
and the others stopped you,

115
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,341

I mean, he's probably some
big, important wizard now

Well, if Sunburst is
that good at magic,

maybe he'd appreciate
your [ahem] exploits.

122
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,298
You should talk to
Twilight about it.

I'm sure she'd want to
hear what you have to say.

she hasn't either.

Why is there a statue of
you in the Crystal Empire?

Because Spike, the

00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,187
Take it easy.

349
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:28,418
Just pick whoever looks the
most like Honor Guard material.

350
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,326
Right. Right!

351
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:35,298
I'm sorry;

352
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,732
fatherhood is way more
stressful than I ever thought.

353
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:40,756
I can only imagine.

354
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:43,686
Now, I know choosing
the crystal of purity

355
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:45,433
is a very important decision,

356
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:48,350
so I have gone through the
trouble of arranging them

357
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,018
in order from incredibly
pure to outrageously pure.

358
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:56,080
Um, Rarity? Don't they
all sort of look the same?

359
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,849
Oh well, to the
untrained eye, perhaps.

360
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,390
What do you think,
Shining Armor?

361
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,873
I DON'T KNOW!

362
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:07,944
[whispers] I hope
Twilight and Pinkie

363
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:09,790
are having better
luck with the baby.

364
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,670
Well, at least she's having fun!

[baby gurgling happily]

00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,326
Pinkie, hold her still!

I'm trying!

368
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:40,110
So, the Princess of
Friendship wants you and I

369
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,501
to be friends again?

370
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,384
I know. Weird, right?

371
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,243
I don't understand.

372
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:50,590
Did something happen to you
after I left for Magic School?

373
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:54,510
What? No! I don't see what
that has to do with anything.

374
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:56,449
Why would you even ask that?

375
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:01,889
I mean, did something
happen to you

376
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:03,723
after you left for magic school?

377
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:10,424
What? Um. No. Like you said,
I'm a [ahem] important wizard.

378
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,670
I'm sure there's something
on Twilight's list

379
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:15,612
that can help here.

[gasping]

381
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:27,790
OK. I chose the Honor Guard,
picked the Purity Crystal

382
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,756
and I know exactly who I
want to be our Crystaller.

383
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:32,824
So, all we need is...

384
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,353
The baby?

385
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,600
We're here!

386
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:41,353

I'm guessing that's gonna make
it hard to do the Crystalling.

It's worse than that...
