00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,860
( Apple Bloom groaning )

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,700
Oh, what to wear?
What to wear?

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,070
Oh, what to wear?

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,280
Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,460
It's not like it's
the Harvest Day Parade.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,220
We're just going
to the train station.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,590
Oh, too casual.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,300
Too summery.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,970
Your cousin isn't gonna care
what you're wearing.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,690
Just pick something.

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,200
This is my first time
meeting her.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,170
And she's from Manehattan.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,410
I want to make
a good impression.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,160
You know what would make
a good impression?

15
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:35,720
What?

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,010
Being on time to pick her up!

17
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,140
Ah...

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,230
( Apple Bloom groans )

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,090
You got nothing to worry about,
sugar cube.

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,730
Y'all are gonna
get along great.

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,610
You already have
something in common.

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,240
Neither of you have
your Cutie Mark.

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,440
What?! How could you forget to
tell me something like that?

25
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,620
- Well, I--
- Oh, this changes everything.

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,530
Meet you at
the train station.

27
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,530
I gotta tell Sweetie Belle
and Scootaloo.

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,670
You know your cousin
is supposed to sleep in here!

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,920

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,740
( ponies giggling )

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,550
You really think
she'll want to join?

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,500
She doesn't have
her Cutie Mark.

33
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,360
Of course she'll want to join
the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

34
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,490
I'm just so excited
I could burst.

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,130
( train whistles )

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,770
Is that the train
from Manehattan?

37
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:05,980
Yep.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,480
That's her! Oh, wait,
no, no, that's not her.

39
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,160
Oh, wait. No, that's her.

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,940
Um, no. Wait.

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,480
That's not her either.

42
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,510
Apple Bloom, you've never
met Babs Seed, remember?

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,540
Oh, heh-heh, yeah.

44
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,380
Ah, that's her.

45
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,420
Babs! Babs!

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,460
It's me, your cousin,
Apple Bloom.

47
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,770
And this is Sweetie Belle.
And this is Scootaloo.

48
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,690
And we are so, so,
so glad you're here.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,190
Thanks, I'm happy to--

50
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,160
This is going to be
the best week of your life!

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,410
Sure hope it's gonna be--

52
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,520
Seriously, we are
gonna have a blast.

53
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,220
( chuckles )

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,810
SWEETIE BELLE:
The Summer Harvest Parade
is going on while you're here.

55
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,260
We get to ride in a float.

56
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,280
Really? I've never been
on a float before.

57
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,960
And we've got a really big
surprise for you.

58
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,750
Yeah. Uh, a surprise?

59
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,130
APPLE BLOOM:
I give you...

60
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,090
...the Cutie Mark Crusaders
Clubhouse.

61
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,460
BABS:
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

62
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,560
A club devoted to helping ponies
get their Cutie Marks.

63
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,540
We're its founding members.

64
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,220
Technically,
we're its only members.

65
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,890
But we're always
looking to expand

66
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,890
and you seem like
the perfect candidate.

67
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,200
I do?

68
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,190
Well, yeah.

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,730
Since you don't have
a Cutie Mark and all.

70
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,320
Oh. Yeah. That.

71
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,640
Allow me to show you just
some of the highlights

72
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,130
of our clubhouse, should
you choose to join us.

73
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,280
This is where
we do our roll call.

74
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:43,890
Huh.

75
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,610
APPLE BLOOM:
This is where
we eat our lunch.

76
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,120
Sometimes we stand here
and think up great ideas.

77
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,820
Yeah. Uh...

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,050
Uh, could you excuse us
for a moment?

79
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,190
Sure.

80
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,140
Thought she'd be
more impressed.

81
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,600
She's from Manehattan.

82
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,890
If we want to impress her
we need to really wow her.

83
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,560
ALL:
Hmm...

84
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,080
Ah! The float.

85
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,730
She can ride with us on our
Summer Harvest Parade float.

86
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,300
That's perfect.

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,060
This really is a good spot
for thinking up great ideas.

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,770
ALL:
Mm-hm.

89
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,980
APPLE BLOOM:
Here it is.

90
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,700
The official Cutie Mark
Crusaders float

91
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,510
for the Summer
Harvest Parade.

92
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,670
As a member of
the Cutie Mark Crusaders

93
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,330
you'd be able to ride
on it with us.

94
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,860
It'd be totally fun.

95
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,570
Uh...

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,460
More like funny...

97
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,130
BOTH:
Looking! Ha-ha-ha!

98
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,000
What is that thing?
A giant orange?

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,210
( both laugh )
It's a pumpkin.

100
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,040
More like a lame-kin.

101
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,010
( laughs )

102
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,370
Who's the new blank flank?

103
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,420
She's my cousin, Babs.

104
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,440
She's from Manehattan.

105
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,450
Manehattan, huh?

106
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,560
Well, I guess you have
that going for you.

107
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,250
Suppose you're gonna join
their little club?

108
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,510
What's it called?
The Cutie Mark Crusaders.

109
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:27,990
<i>( tense theme playing )</i>

110
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,020
( puffs air )

111
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,090
More like
the Cutie Mark Crybabies.

112
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,380
( chuckles )

113
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,170
- Hey!
- Ooh. Big city attitude.

114
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,760
I like it.
Mm-hm.

115
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,910
Oh, yeah? Well, there's more
where that came from.

116
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,660
Check this out. Unh!

117
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,720
Oh, no, she didn't.

118
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,510
( all laughing )

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,490
( creaking )

120
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,400
<i>( dramatic theme playing )
( creaking )</i>

121
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,140
Looks like somepony's pumpkin
just got squashed.

122
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,310
( both laugh )

123
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,130
When I tell Applejack--

124
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,260
You gonna tell
Applejack what?

125
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,140
Well, you know, uh...

126
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,410
What are you, a snitch?

127
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,760
Come on, Babs.

128
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,090
You should hang with us.

129
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,160
You know, the cool ponies.

130
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,620
Not these babies.

131
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,900
What just happened?

132
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,490
I think Babs just
went to the dark side.

133
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,370
We have to tell Applejack.

134
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,830
No. We're not snitches.

135
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,780
Yeah.
And we're not babies.

136
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,720
Then why do I
feel like crying?

137
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,880
I still can't believe
she ruined our pumpkin float.

138
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,620
I still can't believe
I'm related to such a big stinking bully.

139
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,870
What are we going to do?

140
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,900
We're gonna build a new float,
that's what.

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,300
Why bother?

142
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,440
She'll probably just
ruin that one too.

143
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,960
( groans )

144
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,540
We could always
tell Applejack.

145
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,940
What are you, a snitch?

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,000
BOTH:
No!

147
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,640
We're not gonna be
a bunch of tattletales.

148
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,880
Besides, she's only here
a couple of weeks.

149
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,880
We'll just avoid her like
the plague until she goes home.

150
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,900
Avoid her. Yeah.
How hard can that be?

Babs, you gotta
get out of that float!

327
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,200
You're not getting your
float back, crybabies.

But it's booby trap--

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,140
Veggie salad!
ALL: Huh?

330
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,470
Veggie salad!

( crash )

332
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,250
Veggie salad.

Seriously?

PINKIE PIE:
Hey, don't leave me!

No sweat.

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,830
After I'd been so mean to you,
you saved me.

352

Uh, about that...

353
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,610
BABS:
I don't get it.
I saw it all happen.

354
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,820
You pushed me out
just when the float

355
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,200
was about to head
into the lake.

356
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,500
Except we were the reason
it was headed into the lake.

357
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,940
We booby-trapped the float.

358
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,320
You see, Babs,

359
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,060
we were trying
to get you back

360
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,610
for being a big bully.

361
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,850
But then Applejack told us

362
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,640
about how you were being
bullied back in Manehattan.

363
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,830
And we figured out
you were just doing it

364
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,130
to avoid getting
picked on in Ponyville.

365
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,890
But by then, we were
the ones being bullies.

366
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,360
And...

367
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,050
Oh, why does life
have to be so ironic?

368
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,760
Guess what we're
trying to say is...

369
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
ALL:
We're sorry.

370
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,730
( puffs air )

371
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,790
I'm sorry too.

372
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,770
Ah. You know, this all
could've been avoided

373
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,090
if y'all just came to me
in the very beginning.

374
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,780
That's what I
kept on saying.

375
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,360
So can we start over?

376
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,720
Definitely.
Yeah.

the teasing back home.

I thought y'all
were friends now?

No, see, first
we called her "Bad Seed,"

416
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,450
as in actually
a "bad seed."

417
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,680
But now she's "bad"
as in "good." Get it?
