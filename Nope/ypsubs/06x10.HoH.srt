175
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,800
So sorry for the
delay, everypony,

176
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,380
please help yourselves.

177
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,620
So, if you're not
getting enough steam,

178
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,960
that must mean there's
not enough hot water.

179
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,140
Oh Applejack, honestly,

180
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,040
can't we just start
with a hooficure?

181
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,640
We're going to
run out of time!

182
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,940

184
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,520
Ha! Now, what do we have here?

185
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
The laundry room, of course.

186
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,620
And at this point, I'm
considering soaking my hooves

187
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
in one of the machines so my
time here isn't a total loss.

188
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,460
The Ponyville Day Spa prides
itself on sanitary conditions

189
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,520
and fresh linens
are integral part.

190
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,260
Well, sure, but have you
always run every single one

191

full-bore, all day, every day?

192
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,960
The answer is no...

193
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,620
...but ponies sure do love
their warm towel service.

194
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,180
Hmmm.

195
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,890
You are all wanting towel?

196
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Looks to me like you
don't have any left.

197
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,680
Well, like I said. Warm
towels are big hit.

198
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,280
I think I figured
out the problem.

199
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,300
You've got a small leak
and that means the steam

200
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,150
takes just a little
longer to build up

201
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,340
and while ponies wait,
they get cold.

202
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,060
Cold ponies start wrapping
themselves in towels...

203
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,960
...and all those dirty
towels have to be cleaned...

204
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,160
...because Ponyville Day Spa
prides itself on cleanliness.

205
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,280
Eh. What?

206
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,500
Basically, losing steam
makes you use more towels.

207
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,180
That means you do more laundry
which uses up the hot water

208
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,940
you need to make more
steam so the problem

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
just keeps getting worse.

210
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,700
Oh.That makes sense. I see.

211
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,780
Ah! I had no idea.

212
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,700
Wonderful!

213
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,200
Now that we've solved
the great steam mystery,

214
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,580
we can finally get
back to our...

215
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,000
significantly less than
an hour of relaxation.

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,760
Rarity, are you kiddin'?

217
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,860
I can't just leave
things like this.

218
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,900
I'm gonna need my tools.

ponies won't get so cold

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,140
they use up all those towels
and without all that laundry,

224
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,400

Wow, Appleyack. Have you ever
considered a career

in the spa industry? I'm sure
I can find something for you.

relieved I can finally relax

you say, Rarity?

231
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,780
Mmm. It sounds lovely,
Applejack,

232
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,620
but unfortunately...

233

Honestly, how in Equestria
did it never occur to you

236
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
to check for leaks?

237
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,640
There's just so many other
things to worry about.

238
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,260
I suppose we get used
to the way things are

239
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,660
and we don't realize
there was problem.

240
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,440
You obviously need an outside
eye to evaluate the situation.

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,720
It's lucky for you Applejack
is too stubborn to relax.

242
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,760
Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity.

243
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,620
We'll just have to
do this another day.

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,280
Twilight and Spike should be
done feeding the pigs by now.

245
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,010
Twilight is a very capable pony.

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm sure she can figure
out what to do next.

247

Look, I know Twilight's a
princess and an alicorn,

248
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,920
but she isn't a farmer.

249
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,360
I've been doing farm work my
whole life and I'm not sure

250
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,020
it's something you
can just figure out.

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,960
Of course. [gasp] Why don't
we pop back so you can explain

252

went well so far.

easier to just fly?

Applejack fix plumbing

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,120
What about your hour
of spa perfection?

280
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,000
As it turns out, the Ponyville
Day Spa had a few problems

281
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,700
with their steam room and
somepony refused to relax

282

until she had fixed them.

283
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't let those spa ponies

284
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,420
go another minute putting
up with problems

285
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,800
they didn't even know they had.

286
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,380

a huge bottleneck of ponies

standin' around waitin'.

288
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,420
But I took one good
look at that spa-jam

to do something.

a whole operation.

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,680
Whether it's a leaky pipe
or doing too much laundry,

293
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,180
you can't just stick to the
same old way of doing things

294
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,700

you realize the extra work

298
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,600
they were doing was actually
making things worse.

299
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,820
I mean, I guess it's possible
to get stuck in a routine

where you're doing all
this extra stuff

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,040
and not realize it,

302
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,260
but I can't for the life
of me think of how.

at me like that?

What? Of course! Why would
I be doin' it if it weren't?

307

See this gate here used
to squeak so loud,

308
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,380
the pigs would run to the
other side of the pen

309
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
and never come out,

310
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,780
so I open and close it to
let them know it's safe.

311

But it doesn't squeak anymore.

312
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,700
Of course not. I
fixed that ages ago.

313
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,960
Then I realized putting a
little fright into 'em

314
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,400
got them all hustlin'
out of the pen.

315

They don't look
scared to me.

316

Well, no, they got
used to it.

317
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,900
Which is why I started doing
the chicken dance to show 'em

318
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,520
that if they didn't get to
eatin' their food,

well open the gate.

spill into the trough

everything you're doing

00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,480
[sigh] Think you can come
up with enough things

346
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,940
for us to do now that we have
more time to relax?

347
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,580
Oh please, I could plan a
week's worth of treatments.

348
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,820
Huh. Well, let's
just start with the

349
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,940
rest of the day for now.

350
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,000
After all the work we
just did on the farm,

351
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,100
I am ready for some
serious relaxation.

352
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,720
[sigh] Thanks for letting me
know there was an opening.

353
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,720
I don't know if I could
make it without my

354
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,580
pampered muzzle massage.

355
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,940
Don't worry about it.

356
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,580
Shall I put you down for
another one tomorrow?

357
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,580
Oh, absolutely.

358
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,900
Sometimes a girl just has to
pamper herself, am I right?

359
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,240
<i>Rarity: You</i>
<i>certainly are.</i>

360
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,940
[gasp] Oh. Oh! Hey! I
was just, uh, uh...

361
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,980
Getting a "sports"
pamperin'? [chuckle]

362
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,280
[giggle] Don't
worry, Rainbow Dash.

363
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,500
We were just heading in for
some pampering ourselves.

364
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,380
You could always join us.

365
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,720
That is if you don't mind
suffering through

366
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,860
one or two "frou-frou"
treatments.

367
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,160
Ah, I suppose I could take
it. You know, for you ponies.

368
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,340
[giggle]

369
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,780
Applejack: Busted!

370
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,100
Rainbow Dash: Yeah.
