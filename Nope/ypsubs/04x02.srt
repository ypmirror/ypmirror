1
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:06,640
<i>It's Princess Luna and </i>
<i>Princess Celestia.</i>

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:07,864
They're missing!

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,898
The Everfree Forest is
<i>... invading.</i>

4
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:13,563
<i>I think I'm starting to</i>
<i>get a pretty good idea</i>

5
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>of who we're up against.</i>

6
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:17,390
I'm reformed; don't
you remember?

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,363
Why don't you ask
your zebra friend?

8
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:23,076
You can turn the potion
from purple to white.

9
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:26,086
You may see why the sky is day

10
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:27,218
and night.

11
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:28,695
Princess Luna!

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,686
There can only be one
princess in Equestria!

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,852
And that princess will be me!

14
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:50,688

15
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,137
Luna! Think of how long you
were banished to the moon.

16
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,587
You'll give us no choice but
to send you back there

17
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:48,781
if you don't stop.

18
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:51,428
Luna, I will not fight you.

19
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,527
You must lower the moon.

20
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,837
It is your duty.

21
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,314
"Luna", I am Nightmare Moon!

22
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,857
I have but one royal duty
now: to destroy you!

23
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:11,129
And where do you
think you're going?

24
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,698
Celestia!

25
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,492
No.

26
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:41,853
Why would Luna do this?

27
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,092
Why now?

28
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:54,146
You're all right.

29
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:55,982
You're all right!

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,553
Princess Celestia?

31
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,664
Oh, dear, sister.

32
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:07,026
I am sorry, but you have given
me no choice but to use these.

33
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:14,887
Are those...the
Elements of Harmony?

34
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,667
But that's how
they looked in...

35
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,247
the past.

36
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,775
This is the night
you banished her.

37
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,783
Noooooo!

38
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:29,438
Why are you all looking
at me like that?

39
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:32,895
It's just you were
mumblin' to yourself.

40
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:35,182
Oh, and don't forget the
uncontrollable sobbing.

41
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:37,300
We were really
worried about you.

42
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:40,357
<i>I, for one, found it </i>
<i>delightful.</i>

43
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:42,640
Sort of a one-pony theater
piece, if you will.

44
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:45,502
You should really consider
taking it on the road.

45
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:48,497
Did you find out whose
rump we need to kick?

46
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,044
And where we can find 'em?

47
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:52,452
I saw something from
a long time ago.

48
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,821
But it didn't explain
what's happening now.

49
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:58,919
Perhaps farther back still
are the answers you seek.

50
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:02,552
<i>Another sip of the potion</i>
<i>will give you a peek.</i>

51
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:04,794
Are you sure about this?

52
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:15,239
Oh, I do hope she breaks
into a song this time.

53
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:30,839
Ho ho! Ho ho ! This
is so much fun!

54
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,926
How about a game of
pin-the-tail-on-the-pony?

55
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:38,325
Play time is over
for you, Discord.

56
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,028
Oh, I doubt that.

57
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:43,812
Hungry?

58
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,333
Suit yourselves.

59
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:58,798
Oooh. What have
you got there?

60
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,229
The Elements of Harmony.

61
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:02,801
With them we shall defeat you.

62
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:05,674
This must be when they turn
Discord into stone.

63
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:10,975
You should see
yourselves right now.

64
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:12,934
<i>The expressions on your face.</i>

65
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:16,035
<i>So intense. So sure</i>
<i>of yourselves.</i>

66
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,756
<i>Ah ha ha!</i>

67
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,892
Hilarious!

68
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,402
The Tree of Harmony.

69
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:40,280
The Tree of Harmony?

70
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,680
My Cutie Mark.

71
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,074
Are you sure?

72
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:57,143
We have managed to
discover the only means

73
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:59,104
by which we can
defeat Discord

74
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:01,157
and free the citizens
of Equestria.

75
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:03,777
<i>Even without these elements,</i>

76
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:06,567
<i>the Tree of Harmony will</i>
<i>possess a powerful magic.</i>

77
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,451
<i>As long as that</i>
<i>magic remains,</i>

78
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,508
it will continue to control and
contain all that grows here.

79
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:25,853
So, what did
you find out?

80
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:28,357
I still don't know what's
happened to Princess Luna

81
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,596
and Princess Celestia,

82
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:32,107
but I think I know why
the Everfree Forest

83
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:33,002
is acting this way.

84
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,105
Something's happened
to the Tree of Harmony.

85
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,566
The Tree of what now?

86
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:41,742
It's where Princess Celestia
and Princess Luna

87
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:42,599
found the Elements.

88
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:44,310
I think it's in danger.

89
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:47,443
Well, all right then,
let's go save a...

90
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:49,002
tree.

91
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:51,348
Uh, where is it exactly?

92
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,182
I think it's in ...

93
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:54,364
...there !

94
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,638
Hoo hoo!

95
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,104
I'm going to need
more popcorn.

96
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,957
Seems like only yesterday we
were heading into these woods

97
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,637
to find the Elements
of Harmony.

98
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,033
Seems like only yesterday
I was foolish enough

99
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,177
to think I should go
after them on my own.

100
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,846
I don't know what we're
going to face in there.

101
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:27,077
But whatever it is, I know
we need to face it together.

102
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,150
We can use those to cross.

103
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:07,416
<i>That was close.</i>

104
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:11,598
A little too close
if you ask me.

105
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:12,946
You sure you're
all right?

106
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:14,177
I'm fine.

107
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,563
I just can't seem to get
these new wings to do

108
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,780
what I want them to do
when I want them to do it.

109
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:20,997
Aw, you'll figure
it out eventually.

110
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:23,404
"Eventually" isn't soon enough.

111
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,764
You have been havin' an awful
lot of trouble with those things

112
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:30,489
and well, who knows what
else is gonna come after us.

113
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,016
You know, maybe it wouldn't
be such a bad idea

114
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,583
for Twilight to go
back to Ponyville

115
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,720
and let us look for the Tree
of Harmony without her.

116
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:38,343
What? Why?

117
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:41,322
For starters, you just about
got eaten by a Cragidile.

118
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:42,606
We all did.

119
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,405
He wasn't after
just me.

120
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,614
Sure. But... well, the rest of
us aren't princesses.

121
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:50,815
What's that got
to do with anything?

122
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,619
Princess Celestia and
Princess Luna are gone.

123
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,281
If something happened to you,

124
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:58,415
I just don't think Equestria can
risk losin' another Princess.

125
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:00,938
Applejack does
make a valid point.

126
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,283
Even if we manage to
save the Tree of Harmony,

127
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:05,223
it won't necessarily
mean Princess Celestia

128
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,628
and Princess Luna
will return.

129
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:09,765
Equestria will need somepony
to lead in their absence.

130
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:11,434
But the Tree of Harmony.

131
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:14,064
I'm the only one who has seen it
and knows what it looks like.

132
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:16,622
Huge tree. Cutie
Marks on the trunk.

133
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:19,192
Probably being attacked by
something hideously awful.

134
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,906
Yeah. I'm pretty sure we'll
know it when we see it.

135
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,153
All of you feel this way?

136
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:27,664
<i>Feel like I shouldn't be here?</i>

137
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,560
It is probably
for the best.

138
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,624
Help! Help!

139
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:45,611
Discord!

140
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,390
You're welcome!

141
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:53,313
Ha.

142
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:56,263
No luck finding your tree?

143
00:10:56,396 --> 00:11:00,025
We ran into some trouble and my
friends decided it would be best

144
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:02,497
if I returned to Ponyville
while they continue the search.

145
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,876
Equestria will need me if
Princess Celestia

146
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,474
and Princess Luna
don't return.

147
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:09,639
I'm just surprised that
you agreed to their plan.

148
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:11,488
I never thought you'd
be the kind of pony

149
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:15,715
who would think she was
better than everypony else.

150
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,646
I don't think I'm
better than anypony.

151
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:21,157
Oh! Well, how silly of me to
assume you would think that.

152
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,096
All you did was choose to keep
your precious Princess-self

153
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,259
out of harm's way while your
friends thrust themselves

154
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:29,334
right into it.

155
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:33,088
<i>I'm sure you'll all be</i>
<i>the best of pals again</i>

156
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:35,244
<i>when they return from</i>
<i>their terrifying,</i>

157
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,738
<i>yet deeply bonding</i>
<i>experience</i>

158
00:11:37,882 --> 00:11:40,171
<i>that they're having</i>
<i>without you.</i>

159
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,850
I never should have
agreed to come back here.

160
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:49,715
Come on, Twilight,
Discord may be reformed

161
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,147
but he's not that reformed.

162
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:53,313
He's just trying to
get under your skin.

163
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:55,371
Well, it's working!

164
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:06,864
Anypony else starting to
think this is a lost cause?

165
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:09,736
We're almost at Celestia
and Luna's old castle.

166
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,360
Maybe whatever
Twilight saw

167
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,982
when she took that crazy
potion wasn't real.

168
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,600
Maybe there is no
Tree of Harmony. Maybe--

169
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,340
Maybe it's
right down there.

170
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,606
It can't be.

171
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:26,499
How are we supposed
to get to it?

172
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:32,961
Take the stairs, silly!

173
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,750
Are we there yet?

174
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,993
I don't know where
we are. We're lost.

175
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:42,083
I never should've
left my friends.

176
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:43,586
We can't just give up.

177
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,491
Maybe if I get up there,
I'll be able to spot 'em.

178
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:52,659
Well, what do you know?

179
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:54,616
Twilight!

180
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,410
Fluttershy: I think it's dying!

181
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,643
So let's save it already.

182
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:10,335
Oof!

183
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,125
Nice try.

184
00:13:14,282 --> 00:13:15,412
Whoa!

185
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,115
Oof!

186
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,060
Valiant effort on
both your parts,

187
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:20,021
but the tree
remains in jeopardy.

188
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,337
And I suppose you've
got a better idea.

189
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:25,344
That's what I thought.

190
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:27,461
I know who would
know what to do.

191
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:29,711
But we sent her home.

192
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,145
It was your idea, Applejack!

193
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:45,287
We all agreed it was the
best thing, Rainbow Dash!

194
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,274
We were tryin'
to protect her.

195
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:54,405
Twilight!

196
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:55,168
Trouble!

197
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:56,097
Help!

198
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,585
Listen here, you
rabid rhododendrons.

199
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:15,639
You mess with one of us.
You mess with all of us.

200
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:20,025
Up here!

201
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:25,063
Yoo-hoo! Come
and get me.

202
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:26,468
Don't forget about me!

203
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:35,266
<i>Ta-da! </i>

204
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:45,299
I sure am glad you
came lookin' for us.

205
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:47,471
Not as glad as I am
that you found me.

206
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:51,869
The truth of it is, Twilight,
we're simply lost without you.

207
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,457
Yeah. Equestria may
need its Princess...

208
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,128
But we need our friend.

209
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:19,777
<i>Even without these </i>
<i>Elements,</i>

210
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:22,735
<i>the Tree of Harmony will</i>
<i>possess a powerful magic.</i>

211
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,380
<i>As long as that magic remains,</i>
<i>it will continue to control</i>

212
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:28,638
and contain all that grows here.

213
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:33,916
I know how we can save the Tree.

214
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,934
We have to give it the
Elements of Harmony.

215
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,631
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

216
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:42,556
How are we supposed
to protect Equestria?

217
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,595
How are we meant
to rein Discord in

218
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,346
if we can't use the Elements
to turn him back to stone?

219
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:49,724
Twilight, the
Elements of Harmony...

220
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:52,349
They're what keep us
connected no matter what.

221
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,402
You're right about
one thing, Applejack.

222
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:58,224
The Elements of Harmony
did bring us together.

223
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:00,768
But it isn't the Elements
that will keep us connected.

224
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:01,912
<i>It's our friendship.</i>

225
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,858
<i>And it's more important and</i>
<i>more powerful than any magic.</i>

226
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:06,788
My new role in Equestria

227
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,963
may mean I have to take
on new responsibilities.

228
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,280
And our friendships
may be tested.

229
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:14,158
<i>But it will never,</i>
<i>ever be broken.</i>

230
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:16,325
There's no time to lose.

231
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,623
Everypony ready?

232
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:19,055
Ready!

233
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:17,685
Oh, poo!

234
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,596
We know how difficult it
must have been for you

235
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,905
to give up the Elements.

236
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,590
It took great courage
to relinquish them.

237
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,138
What's inside it?

238
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:15,865
How am I supposed to open it?

239
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,712
<i>Six locks.</i>
<i>Six keys.</i>

240
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,235
I do not know
where they are.

241
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,836
But I do know that
it is a mystery

242
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,972
you will not be
solving alone.

243
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:37,849
Bravo, ladies! Bravo!

244
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,263
How ever did you save
the day this time?

245
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:43,980
Blast a beastie with your
magic necklaces, I presume?

246
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,098
Where are those little
trinkets of yours?

247
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,938
You know, the ones you
use to send me back

248
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:52,126
to my extremely
uncomfortable stone prison.

249
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:53,855
Gone.

250
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:55,352
Gone? Ha ha.

251
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:56,669
Gone?

252
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,377
But our friendship remains.

253
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:01,998
And if you want to
remain friends,

254
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
you'll stop thinking whatever
it is you're thinking

255
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:06,042
and help us clean up.

256
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:07,570
Fine.

257
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:09,916
But I don't do windows.

258
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,271
One thing I don't get.

259
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:14,039
Why'd all this happen now?

260
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,548
<i>I have no idea.</i>

261
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:19,557
Those seeds I planted
should've sprouted up ages ago.

262
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,465
What did you say?

263
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,440
Oh. Why should I
try to explain it,

264
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,851
when you can see
for yourself?

265
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:36,240
Play time is over
for you, Discord.

266
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:38,716
Oh, I doubt that.

267
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:41,553
Hungry?

268
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:45,748
Well, obviously things didn't go
<i>according to my original plan.</i>

269
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,409
<i>My plunderseeds should</i>
<i>have stolen the magic</i>

270
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,391
<i>from the Tree of Harmony</i>

271
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,630
<i>and captured Princess</i>
<i>Celestia and Princes Luna</i>

272
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,304
<i>thousands of moons ago.</i>

273
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:58,257
<i>Alas, it seems the Tree</i>
<i>had enough magic</i>

274
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,814
<i>to keep the seeds from</i>
<i>growing up big and strong.</i>

275
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:03,972
<i>Until now, that is.</i>

276
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:09,063
You realize this is information
we could have used hours ago?

277
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:12,905
And rob you of a valuable
lesson about being Princess?

278
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:15,539
What kind of friend
do you think I am?

279
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:41,174
Citizens of Equestria, it is
no longer with a heavy heart,

280
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:44,682
but with great joy, that
I raise the summer sun.

281
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,543
For this celebration
now represents,

282
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:50,144
not the defeat of
Nightmare Moon,

283
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,320
but the return of my
sister, Princess Luna.
