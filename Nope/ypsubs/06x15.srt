1
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:06,516
I'm so sorry I lost track
of time on our picnic.

2
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:09,409
I didn't mean for us to get
caught out here after dark,

3
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:12,092
but there's really
nothing to be afraid of.

4
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:15,224
The forest at night is the same
as the forest during the day...

5
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:21,310
...only darker.

6
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:27,280
Still, maybe we should
hurry back to the cottage.

7
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,144
Nothing to worry
about. No reason to...

8
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,581
RUN!

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,298
AAAHHHH!

10
00:00:56,953 --> 00:01:01,175
Haw! Haw! Haw!

11
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:05,649
Got ya! Ha ha ha!

12
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:13,144
That wasn't funny.
You really scared me.

13
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:14,393
I hope you're happy.

14
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:21,126
Nope. You're too easy.
You're scared of everything.

15
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,070
That's not true!

16
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:24,664
Boo.

17
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,323
AAAHHHH!

00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:13,150
I mean, how could you
not appreciate that?

20
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,818
Because I don't think
being scared is very fun.

21
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,335
I do! Your heart
gets all racey!

22
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:23,138
Your hooves get all tingly.
Your mouth gets all dry-y.

23
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:27,532
Actually, I don't like that
part, but the rest is great!

24
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,956
See? Everypony likes a good
prank. They're just jokes.

25
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:33,692
Now, Rainbow Dash,

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,963
I don't think Fluttershy
would have called us all here

27
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,326
to talk about this if she
thought it was funny.

28
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,298
Everypony has things they
like and things they don't.

29
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:44,030
And scaring Fluttershy
is just lazy.

30
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:46,326
LAZY?

31
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:47,963
A prank isn't
very good

32
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:49,643
if you're the only
pony laughing.

33
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,396
But what if it's really,
really, really, really,

34
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:53,009
really, really funny?

35
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,935
And I can do funny.

36
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,963
I know you can. I guess
the trick is making sure

37
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:59,175
that your idea of funny

38
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,200
matches the pony you're
pranking. That way-

39
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:20,473
Good one, Rainbow! You have
to admit. That was funny.

40
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:22,418
Not really.

41
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:26,018
Yeah. A whoopee cushion
is like a joke shortcut.

42
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,520
WHAT!?

43
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:28,947
Honestly, Rainbow Dash,

44
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,923
if you are not willing
to put forth the effort

45
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:33,575
required to pull a prank
that everypony can enjoy,

46
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:35,556
you may as well not
pull one at all.

47
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,612
Fine. If you ponies
want effort,

48
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:41,735
then that's just
what you'll get.

49
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:46,061
I'm not sure she
understood what we meant.

50
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,713
I know you're excited about
the Filly Guide cookie drive,

51
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,990
but I still have to do
a few finishing touches

52
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,104
on your uniform.

53
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,726
Mmmm. Not bad.

54
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:06,689
Hmm. "You asked for it."

55
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,944
What does it mean?

56
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:12,233
Hmm. I assume this is
Dash's idea of a prank.

57
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,713
Which can only mean she's
rigged some kind of booby trap

58
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,676
to your Filly Guide
uniform up there.

59
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,935
So... how do we
get it down?

60
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,606
We don't. If Dash thinks
I'm going to fall

61
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,812
for whatever she's
got in mind,

62
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,166
she's got another
thing coming.

63
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,347
There's more uniforms
where that one came from.

64
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:36,080
Mmm. The sewing machine
cake is actually better

65
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,335
than the cake cake!

66
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:39,587
RAINBOW DASH!

67
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:46,935
GOTCHA! Ha ha!
How's that for effort?

68
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:58,110
What's all this, Applejack?

69
00:04:58,338 --> 00:04:59,858
I thought you were
gonna help me get ready

70
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,532
for the Filly
Guide Cookie drive.

71
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:05,415
Uh, yeah. Sorry about that,
but Rainbow Dash has been

72
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:08,344
on a pranking tear and you
can never be too careful.

73
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:10,984
Do you really think Dash
is gonna try to prank you

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,840
in your sleep?

75
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,240
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

76
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:16,855
See you in the
morning, sugar cube.

77
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,612
Huh?

78
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:30,363
Whooooaa.

79
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:43,538
Ha! Still think I'm
lazy? Gotcha! Ha ha!

80
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,627
RAINBOW DASH!

81
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:06,289
Ha ha! Got ya!

82
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:41,501
Got ya!

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,076
Got ya!

84
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,089
Got ya!

85
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,735
Pinkie, we need
your help.

86
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,089
OK!

87
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:14,683
For what?

88
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:17,304
Are you honestly going to
stand there and tell us

89
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,360
you know nothing about all
the pranking Rainbow Dash

90
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:20,240
has been doing?

91
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:23,655
Oh, no. She's been
pranking up a storm!

92
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:25,489
Did she get you, too?

93
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:28,240
Oh, yeah.
She and Gummy both...

94
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:31,649
Boo.

95
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:36,067
AHH-HAHAHA!

96
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,640
They got me good.

97
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:40,400
Well, she needs to stop.

98
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:43,286
Stop? But pranks
are so much fun.

99
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:46,067
Not for everypony and it
doesn't seem like Dash

100
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:48,264
is taking the time to
find out who enjoys them

101
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:49,507
and who doesn't.

102
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:54,763
Uh, since you and Dash
share such an... affinity

103
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:59,224
for pranking, we thought you
might be able to get her to, um...

104
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:00,769
quit it.

105
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,418
Hey, Rainbow Dash!

106
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,612
I have something very
important to tell you.

107
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,046
Pinkie! Hey.

108
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:20,578
I actually have something
totally important to tell you!

109
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,390
You do? Oh.
You go first!

110
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,698
OK, you know how I've
been pranking everypony?

111
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:31,581
Yeah. It's been
pretty funny.

112
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,766
I-I mean, actually,

113
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:36,307
that's what I have
to talk to you about.

114
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:37,716
Here, have a cookie.

115
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:39,384
Oooh. Thanks.

116
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:43,618
So I got to thinking,
why waste my time

117
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,889
pranking every
pony one at a time,

118
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,369
when I could prank
everypony at once!?

119
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:53,304
Wow. Everypony at
once? That sounds amazing.

120
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,880
Uh. Wait. I mean,
it's not...

121
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,769
You don't even know
what it is yet.

122
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,812
Pinkie, this is going to
be the best prank ever!

123
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,673
I special ordered
these joke cookies

124
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,809
so the colors would
match my mane.

125
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:08,861
And...?

126
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,935
And I'm gonna switch them
with the Filly Guide Cookies.

127
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:15,156
When Scootaloo and
her friends sell them,

128
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:18,258
everypony in town's gonna
get a rainbow mouth,

129
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:23,716
courtesy of Rainbow Dash, ha
ha! It's gonna be so awesome.

130
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,138
Uh, I don't know.

131
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:29,520
I mean, it doesn't really
seem all that funny.

132
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:31,378
WHAT!?

133
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,369
Maybe this is a good time to
stop pranking for a while.

134
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,184
The other ponies
in town have--

135
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:40,701
STOP!? No way! This prank
is happening, Pinkie.

136
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,796
And it's going to
be hilarious!

137
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,606
Pinkie! What's the deal? I
told you I needed your help

138
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:01,243
switching out all the
Filly Guide Cookies

139
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:02,504
for the joke cookies.

140
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:05,304
But when you didn't show, I
had to do it all by myself!

141
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,027
Uh, Pinkie?

142
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,680
Wow. Your face is
still pretty rainbowed.

143
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,166
Yeah. I haven't really
been feeling well,

144
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,289
and these joke cookies
are the only thing

145
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,963
that makes me feel better.

146
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:27,950
You don't have any
more, do you?

147
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:32,209
Uh, no. I just told you. I
used them all for the prank.

148
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,187
Oh.

149
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:36,430
Pretty soon, the CMCs
will start selling them

150
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,895
to every pony in town.

151
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,363
Ponies will open their
boxes and start eating.

152
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:42,855
Then all of their teeth
will turn rainbow-colored

153
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,436
and they'll know it was me.

154
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:47,643
It's gonna be so awesome! Come
on. You don't want to miss it.

155
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,886
Actually,I don't think
I can even stand up...

156
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,550
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
MORE COOKIES!

157
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:00,692
Agh! On second thought, maybe
you better stay here and rest.

158
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:03,138
Yeah. You're right.

159
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:07,550
Sorry to miss out. I'm sure
it's going to be hilarious.

160
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:22,400
All right, who's ready
to sell some cookies?

161
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:23,790
ME!

162
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:25,280
Look, here, Rainbow Dash.

163
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
I know you promised
Scootaloo you'd help out,

164
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,883
but I don't want
none of your pranks

165
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:31,409
ruinin' these
fillies' night.

166
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,827
Look, I'll be with
you the whole night

167
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,698
so you can totally
keep an eye on me.

168
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,676
Come on, Applejack,
let's get started.

169
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,329
Yeah! We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

170
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:43,618
We wanna hit every
house in Ponyville!

171
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,393
Come on! You heard her.
Every house in Ponyville.

172
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,680
Heh heh heh.

173
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,246
I think you three
should be real proud.

174
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:59,027
Y'all did a mighty impressive
job for your first go-round.

175
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:01,993
You took the words right
out of my mouth, Applejack.

176
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,283
Isn't that right,
Rainbow Dash?

177
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:10,184
Any minute now.

178
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,935
Uh...any minute now, what?

179
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,495
Huh? Oh. Uh, nothing.

180
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,049
Have you guys noticed
how quiet it's gotten?

181
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:20,129
I mean, it's still
early, right?

182
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,747
Of course it's quiet.

183
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,329
Ponies can't talk
while they're eating

184
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:24,941
those fabulous cookies!

185
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:26,203
You think?!

186
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:27,249
Of course.

187
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:30,953
They're probably all in
a cookie coma right now.

188
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:34,024
Huh. Maybe you're
right. I'll go check.

189
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:44,492
What is going on?

190
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,403
OK, definite
cookie-eating happening.

191
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:53,520
But where is everypony?

192
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,553
They must have seen their
rainbow mouths by now.

193
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:59,040
They should all be running
out into the streets.

194
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:02,406
Unless everypony
went to bed early.

195
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,046
Pinkie?

196
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,849
The whole town
got the cookies

197
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,144
and now everypony is
shut up in their houses!

198
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,273
You don't think there's
something wrong

199
00:14:21,298 --> 00:14:23,470
with the joke
cookies, do you?

200
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:33,427
Mrs. Cake! Whew.
Have you seen Pinkie?

201
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,661
I was thinking I might
have something to do

202
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:36,880
with her not feeling great.

203
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,107
Uh, Mrs. Cake?

204
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:51,575
Cooookies! Cooooookies!

205
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,415
Uhhhhh...I can see you're
busy. I'll come back.

206
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:01,963
COOOOKIEEEES!

207
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:07,273
More coookies.

208
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:10,393
COOOOKIEEEES....

209
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,707
COOOOKIEEEES....

210
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:21,390
COOOOKIEEEES....

211
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:23,790
More coookies

212
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,652
More cookies!

213
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:48,763
Twilight! You've gotta come
with me to Sugarcube Corner.

214
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,763
Something's going
on with the Cakes.

215
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,040
Well, not something, exactly.

216
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:56,209
I mean, it may have something
to do with these joke cookies.

217
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:01,347
COOOKIEEEEES...

218
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:02,067
Oh no.

219
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:05,575
COOOOKIEEEEES.....

220
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:11,476
Fluttershy?

221
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:13,883
COOOOKIEEEEES.....

222
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:26,012
COOOOKIEEEEES.....

223
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,092
COOOOKIEEEEES.....

224
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:36,541
You sure you don't mind
us all coming over?

225
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,061
Oh, of course not.

226
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:40,283
I think the girls have
earned a little celebration

227
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:41,470
for all of their hard work.

228
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:44,818
And I have plenty of sewing
machine cake left over.

229
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:47,520
Unless, anypony
wants a cookie.

230
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:49,200
Don't touch those!

231
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,840
Oh! There is certainly
no call for that.

232
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:53,981
There is plenty
for everypony.

233
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:55,944
Come on! We've got
to get out of here.

234
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:58,609
What in tarnation are
you going on about?

235
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,578
There's no time! You
have to follow me!

236
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you
want all those cookies,

237
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:07,046
you will have to buy them,
just like everypony else.

238
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,473
I don't want the cookies-

239
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:14,547
--but they do.

240
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:16,369
Whhh-what's happening?

241
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:18,455
I'll explain later! Come on!

242
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,812
COOOOOOOKIEEEEEEESSSSS!

243
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,646
We need to find
somewhere to hide!

244
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,000
Cooooookies.

245
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,886
This way!

246
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:45,212
Did we lose them?

247
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:49,624
Why are we running from
the ponies of Ponyville?

248
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,766
What happened to
all of our friends?

249
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,673
I think it's something
in the cookies.

250
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,449
Uh, that's ridiculous.

251
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,027
Filly Guide Cookies
haven't changed for years.

252
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:03,421
It's not like there's a new
ingredient that's turning

253
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,993
the whole town into
cookie-craving zombies.

254
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,772
Unless there is.

255
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:11,446
What are you saying?

256
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,680
What did you do?

257
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:19,286
COOKIEEEES.....

258
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:22,935
Cover the windows!

259
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:26,572
COOOOOOKIIEEEEEEEES!

260
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:38,750
OK. So, I may have switched
all the Filly Guide Cookies

261
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:40,590
for joke cookies that
were supposed to make

262
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,150
ponies' mouths rainbow, but
somehow turned everypony

263
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,415
into mindless cookie-eating
zombies instead.

264
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:48,449
I figure we just hide out here
until the effects wear off

265
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:51,193
and as long as nopony
else eats the cookies,

266
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:52,387
we'll be fine

267
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:56,092
That's lovely, darling,
except for one thing...

268
00:18:56,338 --> 00:19:00,867
We've already eaten them.

269
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,978
Looks like your prank
up and backfired.

270
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:13,593
COOOOKIEEEES!

271
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:20,412
Cooooookies...

272
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,043
More... Cookies...

273
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,046
No. Stay away. They're
making you sick!

274
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:26,381
You don't want these.

275
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:32,330
But we dooo. We want COOKIES.

276
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:36,763
Please. Stop! I never
meant for this to happen.

277
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,504
It was just a harmless prank.

278
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,326
It was supposed to be funny.
But this isn't funny at all!

279
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:45,396
Exactly!

280
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:50,596
What?

281
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,695
Wait. What's happening?

282
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:55,630
Just delighting in
pranking the prankster.

283
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,224
He-heh, yeah.

284
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:59,975
How does it feel to get
some of your own medicine?

285
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,313
So, you're not sick?
None of you are?

286
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,775
Of course not, silly.

287
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:08,800
GOTCHA!

288
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,636
This... was all... a PRANK?

289
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,184
Yep. And you can
thank Pinkie Pie.

290
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:19,224
After you told her about your
plan to prank the whole town,

291
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,000
she got everypony together
and came up with a way

292
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,809
to turn the tables on you.

293
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:26,953
Aw, shucks. It was nothing.

294
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:28,941
Just a little something
I threw together.

295
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:30,763
Uh...

296
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:33,636
Wow. You should
see your face.

297
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,870
Ha ha! Talk about funny!

298
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,316
Well, I don't think
it's very funny!

299
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:43,452
And I'm the one that got
pranked. I was really scared.

300
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,550
I thought I made everypony sick.

301
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,984
You can't just go around...

302
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:48,990
Pranking whoever
you feel like?

303
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,575
Without thinking about how
it might make them feel?

304
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,243
Or if they'd even enjoy it?

305
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,200
Or think it's funny?

306
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:59,963
Yeah! Oh. I see
what you did there.

307
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:02,547
Pranks can be a lot
of fun when everypony

308
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:05,347
has a good time. I thought
you just needed to see

309
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:07,163
what it's like
when they don't.

310
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:10,775
I guess I did. I'm
sorry, everypony.

311
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:14,080
I haven't really been thinking
about how other ponies feel.

312
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,818
Well, I hope you
learned your lesson.

313
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,981
Totally! You ponies pulled
off an amazing prank.

314
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:22,529
I'll have to work
extra hard to top it.

315
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:26,160
Gotcha!
