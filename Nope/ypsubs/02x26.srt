1
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:06,340
Princess Celestia cordially
invites you to the wedding of

2
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:09,206
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza,
and...

3
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:10,557
my brother?!

4
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:12,051
Twilie!

5
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:13,781
Ah, I've missed you, kid.

6
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:16,831
How dare you not tell me in person
that you were getting married!

7
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:19,056
A threat has been made
against Canterlot.

8
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:22,981
Princess Celestia asked that I help
provide additional protection.

9
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:26,251
But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying
somepony I don't even know.

10
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:29,592
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance.

11
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:32,206
Cadance is only the most amazing
pony ever!

12
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:35,111
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

13
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:37,480
Cadance, it's me! Twilight!

14
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,667
And I think I should wear it.

15
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:46,626
Are you disagreeing with me?

16
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,432
She's evil!

17
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:54,987
I saw her put a spell on my brother
that made his eyes go all...

18
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,661
Cadance hasn't been
casting spells on me,

19
00:00:57,812 --> 00:01:00,423
she's been using her magic to heal me.

20
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:03,781
If I were you, I wouldn't show up
to the wedding at all.

21
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,279
I just lost a brother.
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,781
You will be.

23
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:18,014

26
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:53,514
Hello?

27
00:01:57,212 --> 00:01:58,933
Is anyone there?

28
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,103
Where am I?

29
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:08,728
The caves beneath Canterlot.

30
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,083
Once home to greedy unicorns
who wanted to claim the gems

31
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:13,565
that could be found inside.

32
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:16,699
And now, your prison.

33
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,391
Help! Help!

34
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:22,052
It's no use. No one can hear you.

35
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:25,006
And no one will ever think
to look for you, either.

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,332
Most ponies have forgotten
that these caves even exist.

37
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:32,658
Which is why they are the ideal place
to keep the ones who try to interfere

38
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:34,079
with my plans.

39
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,175
Plans? What plans?

40
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,360
The plans I have for your brother,
of course.

41
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:45,665
Don't you dare do anything
to my brother, you...

42
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:46,856
you monster!

43
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:50,166
Only way to stop me is to catch me!

44
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,217
Over here!

45
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:01,767
Nope,
over here!

46
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:13,907
No! Wait!

47
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:17,544
Please! Don't hurt me!

48
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,014
Twilight, it's me!

49
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,737
Please, you have to believe me.

50
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,469
I've been imprisoned like you.

51
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,115
The Cadance who brought you
down here was an imposter.

52
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,165
Likely story!

53
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:32,695
Sunshine, sunshine,
ladybugs awake.

54
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,996
Clap your hooves...

55
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,668
...and do a little shake.

56
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,555
You remember me!

57
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:42,498
Of course I do.

58
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:46,051
How could I forget the filly
I love to sit for the most?

59
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,623
We have to get out of here.

60
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:57,413
We have to stop her!

61
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:16,416
<i>This day is going to be perfect</i>

62
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:20,729
<i>The kind of day of which
I dreamed since I was small</i>

63
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,306
<i>Everypony will gather round,
say I look lovely in my gown</i>

64
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:29,984
<i>What they don't know is
that I have fooled them all!</i>

65
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,949
<i>This day was going to be perfect</i>

66
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,815
<i>The kind of day of which
I dreamed since I was small</i>

67
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:42,615
<i>But instead of having cake,
with all my friends to celebrate</i>

68
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:46,715
<i>My wedding bells they may
not ring for me at all</i>

69
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:48,920
<i>I could care less about the dress</i>

70
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,677
<i>I won't partake in any cake</i>

71
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:55,143
<i>Vows, well I'll be lying when I say</i>

72
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:59,403
<i>That through any kind of weather,
I'll want us to be together</i>

73
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:03,486
<i>The truth is I don't care for him at all!</i>

74
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,715
<i>No, I do not love the groom</i>

75
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:10,551
<i>In my heart, there is no room</i>

76
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:17,277
<i>But I still want him to be all mine!</i>

77
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:21,528
<i>We must escape before it's too late,
find a way to save the day</i>

78
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,716
<i>Hope, I'll be lying if I say</i>

79
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,741
<i>I don't fear that I may lose him,
to one who wants to use him</i>

80
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:32,330
<i>Not care for, love and cherish
him each day</i>

81
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:35,687
<i>For I oh so love the groom</i>

82
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:39,737
<i>All my thoughts he does consume</i>

83
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:47,224
<i>Oh Shining Armor,
I'll be there very soon</i>

84
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:59,801
<i>Finally the moment has arrived</i>

85
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:03,372
<i>For me to be one lucky bride</i>

86
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:07,080
<i>Oh, the wedding we won't make,
he'll end up marrying a fake</i>

87
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:09,907
<i>Shining Armor will be...</i>

88
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:12,378
Mine, all mine.

89
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:19,231
Mares and gentlecolts,

90
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:22,464
we are gathered here today
to witness the union of

91
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,338
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza
and Shining Armor.

92
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,614
We're never going to save him.

93
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,981
We will.
We just have to find...

94
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:34,527
there!

95
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,429
You're not going anywhere.

96
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,793
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor,

97
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:55,285
it is my great pleasure
to pronounce you...

98
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:56,605
Stop!

99
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:04,705
Why does she have to be
so possessive of her brother?

100
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:09,836
Why does she have
to ruin my special day?

101
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,840
Because it's not your special day.

102
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:15,091
It's mine.

103
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:17,347
What?

104
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,563
But how did you escape my bridesmaids?

105
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:31,192
I want it!

106
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,678
Clever. But you're still too late.

107
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,665
I don't understand.
How can there be two of 'em?

108
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,558
She's a changeling.

109
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,575
She takes the form of somepony
you love and gains power

110
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:46,226
by feeding off your love for them.

111
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,981
Right you are, Princess.

112
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:10,633
And as queen of the changelings,
it is up to me to find food

113
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:12,084
for my subjects.

114
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:15,890
Equestria has more love than
any place I've ever encountered.

115
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,724
My fellow changelings will be
able to devour so much of it

116
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,454
that we will gain more power
than we have ever dreamed of!

117
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:25,169
They'll never get the chance!

118
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,800
Shining Armor's protection spell
will keep them from ever even reaching us.

119
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,325
Oh, I doubt that.

120
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:34,076
Isn't that right, dear?

121
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,557
Don't wanna go back to the caves,
now do you?

122
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:47,990
Ever since I took your place, I've been
feeding off Shining Armor's love for you.

123
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:51,125
Every moment he grows weaker,
and so does his spell.

124
00:08:51,276 --> 00:08:54,239
Even now my minions
are chipping away at it.

125
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:04,685
He may not be my husband,
but he is under my total control now.

126
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:12,181
And I'm sorry to say, unable to perform
his duties as captain of the royal guard.

127
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:13,775
Not my Shining Armor!

128
00:09:14,226 --> 00:09:17,160
Soon, my changeling army
will break through.

129
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,175
First, we take Canterlot.
And then, all of Equestria!

130
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,855
No.

131
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,141
You won't.

132
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,371
You may have made it impossible
for Shining Armor to perform his spell,

133
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:33,771
but now that you have so foolishly
revealed your true self,

134
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:38,167
I can protect my subjects... from you!

135
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,373
Princess Celestia!

136
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,369
Shining Armor's love for you
is even stronger than I thought!

137
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,475
Consuming him has made me
even more powerful than Celestia!

138
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:14,755
The Elements of Harmony,
you must get to them...

139
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,353
and use their power
to defeat the queen.

140
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:25,069
Rarity!

141
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:33,877
You can run, but you can't hide!

142
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:54,907
Go, go!

143
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,645
Looks like we're gonna have
to do this the hard way.

144
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,403
How did you...?

145
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,905
They're changelings, remember?

146
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,789
<i>They're changelings, remember?</i>

147
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,588
Don't let them distract you.

148
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:42,583
We have to get to
the Elements of Harmony.

149
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:43,934
They're our only hope.

150
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:17,008
OK, this is just gettin' weird.

151
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:30,805
Real me! Real me!

152
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:37,790
Do me! Do me!

153
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,548
I've seen better.

154
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,633
You won't get away with this!

155
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,564
Twilight and her friends will...

156
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:44,199
You were saying?

157
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,589
You do realize the reception's
been cancelled, don't you?

158
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,627
Go! Feed!

159
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,822
It's funny, really.

160
00:13:56,973 --> 00:14:00,020
Twilight here was suspicious of
my behavior all along.

161
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Too bad the rest of you were too
caught up in your wedding planning

162
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:06,367
to realize those suspicions were correct.

163
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,527
Sorry, Twi.
We should've listened to you.

164
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:12,670
It's not your fault.
She fooled everypony.

165
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:15,248
I did, didn't I?

166
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:23,600
<i>This day has been just perfect</i>

167
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:28,411
<i>The kind of day of which
I've dreamed since I was small</i>

168
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:30,424
<i>Everypony I'll soon control</i>

169
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:32,744
<i>Every stallion, mare and foal</i>

170
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:37,465
<i>Who says a girl can't really have it all?</i>

171
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,200
Quick! Go to him while
you still have the chance!

172
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,777
Is...is the wedding over?

173
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,399
It's all over!

174
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,700
Your spell! Perform your spell!

175
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,299
What good would that do?
My changelings already roam free.

176
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:28,405
No!

177
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,454
My power is useless now.

178
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:38,577
I don't have the strength to repel them.

179
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:41,271
My love will give you strength.

180
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:45,961
What a lovely but absolutely
ridiculous sentiment.

181
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:51,499
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

182
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,000
You have a real wedding
to put together.

183
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,628
Seriously, though.

184
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,600
I get why the queen of the Changelings
wanted to be with you, but how did you

185
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,588
get someone as amazing as
Cadance to marry you?

186
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:02,085
I told her she wouldn't just
be gaining a husband,

187
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:04,800
she would be getting a
pretty great sister too.

188
00:18:28,122 --> 00:18:30,170
Mares and gentlecolts,

189
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:33,767
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union of the real

190
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:35,758
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza...

191
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,322
Princess Cadance is fine.

192
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,946
The union of Princess Cadance
and Shining Armor.

193
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:44,173
The strength of their commitment
is clear.

194
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,975
The power of their love, undeniable.

195
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:49,013
May we have the rings, please?

196
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:56,496
I now pronounce you mare and colt.

197
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,360
This is your victory as much as theirs.

198
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:13,751
You persisted in the face of doubt.

199
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:18,623
And your actions led to your being able to
bring the real Princess Cadance back to us.

200
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:23,086
Learning to trust your instincts
is a valuable lesson to learn.

201
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,961
Rainbow Dash, that's your cue.

202
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,186
Best. Wedding. Ever!

203
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:53,917
Hello, everypony.
Did I miss anything?

204
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,855
Let's get this party started!

205
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,179
<i>Love is in bloom</i>

206
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,657
<i>A beautiful bride, a handsome groom</i>

207
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,929
<i>Two hearts becoming one</i>

208
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:19,965
<i>A bond that cannot be undone because</i>

209
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:23,500
<i>Love is in bloom</i>

210
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:27,170
<i>A beautiful bride, a handsome groom</i>

211
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:31,103
<i>I said, love is in bloom</i>

212
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:34,691
<i>Starting a life and making room</i>

213
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,342
<i>For us
(For us)</i>

214
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,037
Twilight!

215
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:44,299
None of this would've been
possible without you, little sis.

216
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,295
Love you, Twilie.

217
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,788
Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.

218
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,428
Ready to go?

219
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,200
Oh! Almost forgot.

220
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,689
IT'S MINE!

221
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,683
Now this was a great wedding.

222
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:14,934
Oh yeah?

223
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:18,621
Just wait until you see what I have
planned for the bachelor party!
