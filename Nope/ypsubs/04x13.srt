1
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:07,822
Wow! I can't believe how
many ponies showed up.

2
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:08,778
<i>I can.</i>

3
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:10,948
<i>I mean, finding out who</i>
<i>the Ponyville Days</i>

4
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:13,170
<i>Pony of Ceremonies is,</i>
<i>is a pretty big deal.</i>

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,366
I didn't know Granny Smith was
on the Selection Committee.

6
00:00:18,696 --> 00:00:19,672
Of course she is.

7
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:22,456
<i>Ponyville Days celebrates</i>
<i>the founding of Ponyville</i>

8
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:24,267
<i>and she was right there.</i>

9
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,241
I'm glad the Committee didn't
automatically pick me

10
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:27,465
so everypony gets
a chance to see

11
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:28,720
how great being
me actually is,

12
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:30,423
even though the Festival
is basically a party

13
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,109
and the Pony of Ceremonies
organizes the whole thing

14
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,738
so it would make
sense if they picked me.

15
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:34,655
Shhhhhh!

16
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,168
Citizens of Ponyville,

17
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:40,284
this year's applicants
were all exceptional,

18
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:43,135
but there can only be
one Ponyville Days

19
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,866
Pony of Ceremonies.

20
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,336
And that pony is...

21
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,283
Rarity!

22
00:00:57,438 --> 00:00:59,890
<i>Whoo whee!</i>
<i>All right, Rarity!</i>

23
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,662
Congratulations, Rarity.

24
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,053
Do you know what
you're going to do?

25
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:13,295
Oh, I might have a few ideas.

26
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:25,660

27
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,712
I'm so excited for the Festival
I can hardly stand up straight.

28
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,667
Me, too. I'm glad
Rarity was picked.

29
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:07,445
I know she'll add a touch of
elegance to the whole thing.

30
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,147
Probably more than a touch.

31
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:17,906
Ahem.

32
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:23,055
This year's Ponyville Days
Festival designed by Rarity,

33
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,696
will feature various high
class events, such as...

34
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,638
<i>A silent cider</i>
<i>auction and tasting...</i>

35
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,439
Ooooh!

36
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:35,102
<i>A Ponyville gala</i>
<i>in Town Square...</i>

37
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:36,907
<i>Aaaaah!</i>

38
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:40,538
<i>And, of course, a</i>
<i>Ponyville fashion show.</i>

39
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:42,261
<i>Ooooooh!</i>

40
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:46,316
This year's Ponyville Days
Festival pony of ceremonies,

41
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:49,994
creates shimmering
couture of her own design.

42
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:54,292
And the theme is,

43
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:58,314
Small Town Chic!

44
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:03,307
Wow, Rarity! You really have
put a lot of effort into this.

45
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:04,310
I'll say.

46
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:07,666
I think it's going
to be magical.

47
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:09,695
Do you really think so?

48
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,941
Are you kidding?
I can't wait!

49
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,980
Oh, that's such a relief.

50
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:16,665
But, of course, I couldn't
possibly do it all on my own.

51
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,221
The festival is in three days!

52
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:21,484
Pinkie Pie and I can hang
lights and decorations

53
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:22,450
in the Town Square.

54
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:25,750
And I can get Sweet Apple Acres
all ready for the cider tasting.

55
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:27,908
That's just perfect.

56
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,979
And now Twilight, if you and
Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping

57
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,111
with the fashion show...

58
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:33,201
Of course.

59
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:34,220
I'd be honored.

60
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:37,381
I can focus on the one thing
I'm worried about most of all.

61
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:38,735
<i>What?</i>

62
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:41,484
Creating a Ponyville
Days Festival

63
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,480
fantastic enough to impress...

64
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,278
TRENDERHOOF!

65
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,877
Uh, who's Trenderhoof?

66
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:52,680
WHAT?

67
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:55,520
How can you not know
who Trenderhoof is?

68
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,599
Trenderhoof is only
the most amazing,

69
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:01,957
handsomest travel writer to
have ever traveled or written.

70
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,053
Before Las Pegasus became an
Equestria travel destination,

71
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,238
he wrote about it.

72
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:08,450
Before the culinary
revolution in Trottingham,

73
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:09,986
he discovered it.

74
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:13,075
He knows what's going to be hot
even before it's tepid.

75
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,671
Sounds like somepony has
a little bit of a crush.

76
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,419
Oh, Twilight.

77
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,778
"Crush" doesn't even
begin to describe it!

78
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:24,610
He's practically divine.

79
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:26,087
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S COMING!

80
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,602
Thank you ever so much
for joining me, Twilight.

81
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,447
I don't think I could have
met Trenderhoof on my own.

82
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:48,200
It's no problem, but you
shouldn't be nervous

83
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:49,104
about meeting him.

84
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,740
Is that him? Do you see him?
Twilight, is he there?

85
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,269
Uh...I'm not sure.

86
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:58,310
You don't suppose he
decided not to come?

87
00:04:58,534 --> 00:04:59,656
Twilight, I don't see him!

88
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:01,129
What if he doesn't arrive?

89
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,131
The whole festival
will be a disaster!

90
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,714
TWILIGHT, WHERE IS HE?

91
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,099
Ahem. Sorry.

92
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:10,554
Rarity, you have to
get a hold of yourself.

93
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:12,407
I mean, you haven't
even met him yet...

94
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,439
What's wrong?

95
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,077
Shhhhhhh.

96
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:36,928
It's him, it's him, it's
him, he's here, it's him.

97
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:39,145
Well, go up and talk to him.

98
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:42,899
I can't.

99
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,137
Um... Hi. Ahem.

100
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:50,807
Hello. Mr. Trenderhoof.

101
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:54,766
I am Rarity and I have been
chosen as Pony of Ceremonies

102
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,587
for the Ponyville Days Festival.

103
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,191
Please.

104
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:01,479
Call me Trend.

105
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,499
And over here will be the
climax of the Festival,

106
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,481
The Ponyville Days Gala.

107
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,550
Music. Dancing.

108
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:18,111
And of course a locally sourced
menu of delicious treats.

109
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:21,112
Reminds me of the Spring Fling
meets Manehattan Wedding

110
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,727
I wrote about in
Gallop & Prance.

111
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,978
Exactly! I can't
even describe

112
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:28,070
how much your work
has influenced me.

113
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,930
And finally, Sweet Apple Acres.

114
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,814
Ponyville's core, heh
heh, so to speak,

115
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:40,115
<i>where our quaint</i>
<i>little hamlet began.</i>

116
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:42,491
<i>Oh! Breathtaking!</i>

117
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:47,465
I've heard about it, of course,
but to see it in verite,

118
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,688
to stand on the soil
of a working farm.

119
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:52,817
You can really feel
the authenticity.

120
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:56,794
Oh yes! Uh, they really
do grow apples here.

121
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,409
Thank you, Rarity.

122
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:00,468
Thank you for
bringing me here.

123
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,375
This farm is truly
something special.

124
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,666
I had planned to transform it
into an elegant country inn

125
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,415
for the Festival,

126
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:12,692
but now I see just how
special it is au natural.

127
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:15,168
Au natural, indeed.  

128
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:21,888
Who.

129
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:23,045
Is.

130
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:24,132
That?

131
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,947
Who? Applejack?

132
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:43,902
Ahem.

133
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:46,362
Why are you staring
at her like that?

134
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,004
I've seen a lot in
my travels, but...

135
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,161
I've never beheld such beauty.

136
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,197
<i>Applejack.</i>

137
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,445
The pony of my dreams.

138
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,863
<i>Rarity?</i>

139
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,168
Rarity?

140
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,485
Hello?

141
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,214
I brought my cider
tasting cup.

142
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:15,959
Are you ready to
go try the samples?

143
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:20,001
What's the point?

144
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,061
Rarity, what's wrong?

145
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:25,440
Nothing.

146
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,445
Is it something I said?

147
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:29,869
He doesn't like me.

148
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,753
What?

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,883
He doesn't like me.

150
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,275
Rarity, I can't hear--

151
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:38,122
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE
HE HAS A CRUSH ON APPLEJACK

152
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:39,888
EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD
A CRUSH ON HIM EVER SINCE

153
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:43,654
THE BEGINNING OF TIME
AND IT'S NOT FAIR!

154
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,418
Trenderhoof doesn't like you?

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,129
That's ridiculous.

156
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,240
Oh, Spike, how could you
ever know what it's like

157
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,131
to be totally
obsessed with a pony

158
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:54,975
only to find out
they're obsessed

159
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:56,956
with somepony else?

160
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:02,963
I mean, what could Applejack
possibly have that I don't?

161
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,012
Hmmm.

162
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,936
You know, I have such
respect for the work ethic

163
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:14,054
of Earth Ponies.

164
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,591
Uh, gee, thanks.

165
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,525
Granny Smith always said,
"Pick an apple a day

166
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:20,661
and keep trouble away."

167
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,539
How many varieties of
apples do you think there are?

168
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,784
On the farm or in all
of Equestria because--

169
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,811
I once had
an apple so rare,

170
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:30,136
they thought it
was extinct.

171
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:31,250
I ate four of them.

172
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,119
Is that a fact?

173
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:37,443
That's my thing.

174
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:39,822
I take the mundane,
the simple, the...

175
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:42,245
unappreciated, and
I make it relatable.

176
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:44,901
Well, I hope you can
relate to Ponyville.

177
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:46,120
Me too.

178
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:47,447
But enough about me.

179
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,979
I want to know about you.

180
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,921
What do apples
mean to Applejack?

181
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:55,529
Look, I'm glad you're
interested in Ponyville and all,

182
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,715
but I'm kinda busy
with my chores

183
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,178
and if I can't get 'em done,

184
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:01,414
there won't be a
Ponyville Days Festival

185
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:02,440
for you to write about.

186
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,632
<i>Well, that</i>
<i>will never do!</i>

187
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:08,647
Rarity, what are you wearing?

188
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,920
What, this old thing?

189
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,320
Aren't you too busy
planning the Festival

190
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:14,950
to keep making new
outfits for it?

191
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:18,720
I am, but the thought of
hauling apples inspired me

192
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,452
and I just couldn't
stop myself.

193
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:22,378
Really?

194
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:26,425
If there's one thing I
love, it's hauling apples.

195
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:31,416
I'm growing fond
of it, myself.

196
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:35,582
Maybe you two should
try it sometime.

197
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm feeling a tad inspired.

198
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:43,049
<i>♪ Without farm life there'd</i>
<i>be such disparity. ♪</i>

199
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:47,010

00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,523
<i>♪ ...Applejack. </i>

203
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:06,928
Rarity, why do you
want to plow a field?

204
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,280
Is it me or could this
use a splash of color,

205
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:11,014
and maybe a wash?

206
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,272
Don't we need to check
on the gala decorations?

207
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:14,495
Yes, yes. Of course.

208
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,942
But Trend obviously has
a thing for farm life.

209
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:20,103
If I can't convince him that
I'm just as much of a farm hoof

210
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:22,985
as Applejack, I'll never get him
interested in the Festival.

211
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:24,355
The Festival.

212
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:25,432
Right.

213
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:28,720
And I do appreciate
your help ever so much.

214
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,060
I couldn't do a thing
without you Spikey pooo.

215
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:35,129
Well... that's what
friends are for.

216
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:36,487
Right! So!

217
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:41,551
Come... On... farm thing!

218
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:46,772
How does Applejack do it?

219
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,432
<i>Well, it would help</i>
<i>if the harness was on right.</i>

220
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:51,705
What are you doing?

221
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,243
I'm simply lending a
hoof with the chores...

222
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:57,024
...which I love
doing ever so much.

223
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:01,605
Well, if you're still
interested after the Festival,

224
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:02,926
I can teach you all about it.

225
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,655
But right now, I need to get the
plowing done if you don't mind.

226
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,611
Not at all.

227
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,238
She makes it look so easy.

228
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:15,740
I know.

229
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:18,097
Isn't she fantastic?

230
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:29,921
I really don't see what
the fuss is all about.

231
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,909
Now, Rarity, you be careful.

232
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,319
If you don't get the
bucking just right,

233
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,794
<i>you could sprain a hoof.</i>

234
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:41,927
I am perfectly familiar with
the applebucking process,

235
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:45,968
thank you very much, but while
you seem to rely on raw power,

236
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,840
I believe a certain amount
of style is required.

237
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:51,761
It's really more of a
dance, if you ask me.

238
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:01,336
Et voilà.

239
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:05,242
Well, your way is
definitely long on style.

240
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:06,442
Thank you.

241
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:09,574
Now if you'll all excuse me,
I have some more chores to do.

242
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,070
Inside!

243
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:19,921
Rarity, can I ask
you something?

244
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,399
Why, Trend, you can
ask me anything.

245
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,869
I've been meaning to ask
for a while and, frankly,

246
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,549
I'm sort of embarrassed.

247
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,880
Rarity...

248
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:37,036
Do you think Applejack would
be my date for the Festival?

249
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,140
Why don't you go ask
her yourself?

250
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:56,460
Phew!

251
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:58,066
That was close.

252
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:01,389
If you've come to apologize,
there's really no need.

253
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,196
What are you talking about?

254
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:05,802
Let's dispense with
the charade, shall we?

255
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,796
Listen, I know you really
want Trend to like you.

256
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:09,966
And he does.

257
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:12,690
Despite somepony's
best efforts.

258
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:16,452
I swear, I don't know why he's
paying so much attention to me.

259
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:19,697
And I don't know anypony who's
that interested in farming.

260
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:20,905
Not even me.

261
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:24,423
Well, maybe it's time Trend
met a real country pony.

262
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:26,440
Shouldn't you be
working on the Festival

263
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:28,967
<i>instead of coming up with</i>
<i>new ways to impress Trend?</i>

264
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,040
Oh, I'm sure you'd love that.

265
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,625
Well, I have a new
vision for the Festival.

266
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:36,692
And it's gonna be more country

267
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:40,152
than the whole Apple
Family put together!

268
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:47,182
Um, Isn't it a little late
to be changing the theme?

269
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,304
Applejack, what's going on?

270
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,474
I'm too scared to guess.

271
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:57,666
<i> Firstly, I just wanna</i>
<i>thank you'all for comin'</i>

272
00:14:58,037 --> 00:15:00,314
<i>and second I know</i>
<i>y'all will all adore</i>

273
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,364
<i>my new Festival theme...</i>

274
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:10,840
Simple Ways!

275
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,437
Well, what's so funny?

276
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:28,355
Rarity, that is the silliest
getup I have ever seen.

277
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,466
It is a little funny.

278
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,539
Funny?

279
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,666
Rarity, you aren't
serious, are you?

280
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:37,260
Well, of course I'm serious!

281
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:38,460
Ahem...

282
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,394
Why wouldn't I be?

283
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:43,047
Because you would
never dress like that.

284
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:46,610
You like fashion and high
society and fancy things.

285
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:51,313
And I can like plowing fields
and hauling apples just as much.

286
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,353
But you don't!

287
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,333
How do you know
what I like?

288
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:56,060
Because I know you.

289
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,097
Well, maybe you don't know
me as well as you think.

290
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:03,648
And I suppose it's just a
coincidence that Trenderhoof

291
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,841
seems so interested
in country life too?

292
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,384
I don't know what
you're gettin' at.

293
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,770
Well, then I guess I'll
just have to show you.

294
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,183
Be my guest.

295
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:15,920
Now, if y'all will excuse
me, I have a hootenanny

296
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:18,011
of a Festival to put on.

297
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:28,519
Now, to be a model in the
Simple Ways fashion show,

298
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:32,269
you might think simple
means less is more.

299
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:34,870
Well, that just ain't so.

300
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:38,960
If you want to be real
simple, more is more.

301
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,783
Now y'all go off and make
yourselves look just like that.

302
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:59,160
Who's our next model
for the fashion show?

303
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,267
Um...

304
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,540
Apple Jewel?

305
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,770
Who the hay is that?

306
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,456
Is this some kinda joke?

307
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:31,978
Why, Rarity, what ever would
make you think I was joking?

308
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,950
Because you would never
wear an ensemble like that!

309
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,434
You like plowing fields
and hauling apples...

310
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:41,211
And I can like
fashion just as much.

311
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,575
But you don't!

312
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:46,534
Well, maybe you do not know
me as well as you think.

313
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,635
Fine.

314
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:50,335
But I got a whole
Festival to plan,

315
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:53,892
so if you're gonna start
modelin', just get on with it.

316
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:59,781
Life is a festival, and you
should celebrate it

317
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:04,624
by looking just like me, because
I'm a trend-setting Fashionista!

318
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:10,587
You're a trend-setting
Fashionista?

319
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:12,798
Why that's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever--

320
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:16,099
I mean, good for you.

321
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:20,029
I, on the other hoof, couldn't
care less how I look

322
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,727
long as I get the chores done.

323
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,502
Oh? Is that so?

324
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,728
Yes indeedy doodle.

325
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,656
Not me.

326
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:35,793
My mane needs to be perfectly
coiffed at all times.

327
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:41,102
Well, my mane is full
of dust and split ends.

328
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,948
My hooves are so polished you
can see your reflection in them.

329
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:49,830
My hooves are cracked and dry
from working in the fields!

330
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,263
I'm so fashion forward.

331
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:54,733
I wear droopy drawers.

332
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,084
I smell like rosebuds.

333
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,078
I LOVE BEING COVERED IN MUD!

334
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:11,239
Goodness! Your couture!

335
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,256
Oh, it's bad.

336
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,698
Will somepony
bring me a towel

337
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:19,034
to wipe this repulsive
filth from my hooves!

338
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:21,203
There's the Rarity I know!

339
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:25,426
Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry
I said all those things.

340
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,744
You're a true friend who
probably knows me better

341
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:28,708
than I know myself.

342
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:32,770
I don't know what I was thinking
wearing this ridiculous outfit.

343
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:34,431
I kinda know how you feel.

344
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,744
But you were just trying to help
me see how silly I was being.

345
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:39,717
And you were right.

346
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,170
Besides, that gown
looks just gorgeous on you.

347
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:45,557
I wish I hadn't ruined it.

348
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:47,480
Thanks. It's
nice ain't it?

349
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:49,057
It's magnificent!

350
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:50,544
Wherever did
you get it?

351
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:53,598
Oh. It's uh... one of yours.

352
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:59,077
I'll need 3 gallons of boiling
water and one ounce of detergent

353
00:19:59,149 --> 00:19:59,742
START!

354
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:04,958
I'm moving to Ponyville!

355
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,633
Being the most interesting Pony
in Equestria is exhausting.

356
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:12,593
I want to leave my exotic,
exciting life behind

357
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,846
and live on a farm.

358
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:15,923
What?

359
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:19,711
Well, that's real nice, but I
sure hope you weren't thinking

360
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:20,866
of Sweet Apple Acres.

361
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:22,415
Oh.

362
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:28,240
Look, you're a fine
pony, but uh, well, I'm...

363
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,729
I think what Applejack
is trying to say,

364
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:33,211
is that there's something
unappealing about a pony

365
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:36,259
who'd change themselves so much
just to impress somepony else.

366
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,915
If somepony doesn't like you for
who you are, it's their loss.

367
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:44,191
Well, this is awkward.

368
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:45,360
Not at all.

369
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:46,409
In fact...

370
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:48,805
I think I know
just how you feel.

371
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:50,544
What do you think, Rarity?

372
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:53,525
Is it too late to go
back to Small Town Chic?

373
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:55,227
Not if I can help it!

374
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,012
<i>Organizing the</i>
<i>Ponyville Days Celebration</i>

375
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,338
<i>was one of the hardest</i>
<i>things I've ever done...</i>

376
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:08,263
<i>But I learned an</i>
<i>important lesson.</i>

377
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:12,401
<i>Real friends will like</i>
<i>you for who you are</i>

378
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:17,118
and changing yourself to impress
them is no way to make new ones.

379
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:23,178
<i>And when you're as</i>
<i>fabulous as I am...</i>

380
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,560
<i>it's practically a crime.</i>
