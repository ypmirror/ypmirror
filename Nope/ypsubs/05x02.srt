1
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:05,573
As princess, I've
been chosen

2
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:07,968
to spread the magic of
friendship across Equestria.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,688
So why would the
Tree of Harmony

4
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:11,582
want us to sit in a
castle in Ponyville?

5
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:13,106
This is incredible!

6
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,146
It's got all of Equestria!

7
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:19,555
Why are our Cutie Marks
over there?

8
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:21,946
It seems like the map
wants us to find out.

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,493
An entire village with
the same Cutie Mark?

10
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:25,964
Welcome!

11
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:28,342
This must be the
most pleasant place

12
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:29,422
in Equestria!

13
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:31,302
I'm delighted you're interested

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,840
in our Cutie Mark vault.

15
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:33,880
It's a trap!

16
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:35,368
Aaah!

17
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,088
Now you can spend the
rest of your lives here.

18
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:41,297
Without your Cutie Marks!

19
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:52,640
YayPonies Regular Subtitles.

20
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:20,106
<i> In sameness,</i>
<i> there is peace.</i>

21
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:23,164
<i> Exceptionalism is a lie...</i>

22
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:26,453
<i> Free yourself from</i>
<i> your Cutie Mark...</i>

23
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,195
<i> Choose equality as</i>
<i> your special talent...</i>

24
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:36,315
Hey! This is pretty good!

25
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:41,564
Ugh. We've got to find
a way out of here.

26
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:43,888
I can't take much
more of that voice.

27
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:46,235
Oh, this is horrible!

28
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:50,057
There there, Rarity,
it's not so bad.

29
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:52,484
Yes it is! Look at
those drapes!

30
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,626
I have no idea if
they're tacky or not!

31
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:57,080
Well, I think they're nice.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,026
So do I!

33
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:05,960
Oh, thank goodness!

34
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:08,040
Can you help us, little birdy?

35
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:13,262
Go on, now. Fly away
and get us help.

36
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:19,946
Oh! Even tweets don't
make sense anymore.

37
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:26,844
Agh! This door's shut
tighter than a...

38
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:28,480
summer of...

39
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,415
of piglets in...

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,475
Shoot, I can't even make
countryisms no more!

41
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:37,613
I don't know, maybe it'll be
super fun to be all the same!

42
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:40,306
Sort of.

43
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:42,786
More pleasant than
fun, I guess.

44
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,177
Something odd about
that staff.

45
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,311
I haven't studied Eastern
unicorns as much as I should've,

46
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:51,457
but I'm pretty sure Meadowbrook
only had eight magical items,

47
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:52,462
not nine.

48
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:55,017
And I don't remember any
of them being a staff.

49
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:57,724
Well, it looks like you'll
have plenty of time

50
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,093
to try to think about it.

51
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:04,213
<i> Difference is frustration...</i>

52
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:06,853
<i> To excel is to fail...</i>

53
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:10,511
<i> Be your best by never</i>
<i> being your best...</i>

54
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,400
<i>Conformity will set you free...</i>

55
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:17,955
<i> Accept your limitations and</i>
<i> happiness will follow...</i>

56
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:20,831
<i> You're no better</i>
<i> than your friends...</i>

57
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:24,022
I'VE GOT IT! I know how
we can get out!

58
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:27,973
Forget it, Twilight.
This door's not opening.

59
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:31,506
And I'm afraid the windows are
much too small for escape.

60
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,164
But there is a third way.

61
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,084
Of course!

62
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:36,008
Eventually the wind and weather
will wear down the walls

63
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:36,955
until they start to crumble!

64
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:39,137
Then all we have to do is wait
for a big enough hole to form

65
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,200
and we can just walk out!

66
00:03:40,284 --> 00:03:41,791
It's the perfect plan!

67
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:43,777
I guess...

68
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:46,168
We don't actually
have to escape.

69
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,773
They'll just let us
out when they think

70
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,222
we've accepted
their philosophy.

71
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:51,733
But they're never gonna
believe we switched over

72
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:53,191
in just one night.

73
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:55,551
There's one of us
they might believe.

74
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:00,097
Ah! Me?

75
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:03,182
You've been saying how great
this place is since we got here!

76
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,688
That's because
everypony's so nice

77
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:08,586
and their village is so
pretty and...and...

78
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:11,751
Oh, you're right.

79
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,982
They probably would
believe me.

80
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:15,871
I hate to lie to them.

81
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:18,386
They've been so
welcoming and friendly.

82
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:21,875
Aside from locking us in here
and trying to brainwash us

83
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:24,164
into abandoning the things
that make us special.

84
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,626
OK. I'll do it.

85
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,862
WOO-HOO!

86
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:32,786
I mean, cool.

87
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,635
But what do I do
once I'm out?

88
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:38,275
You've got to find a way to
get our Cutie Marks back.

89
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,751
Oh, good morning!

90
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,435
I trust you had
a pleasant night.

91
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,431
This way, please.

92
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:52,613
There are some friends
who would like to see you.

93
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:58,040
Gather 'round,
friends, gather 'round!

94
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,573
We've come to ask if any of
you are ready to join us.

95
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:04,533
There are so many friends to
be made, once you realize

96
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,604
you don't need your
Cutie Marks

97
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:09,164
or the talents that
come with them.

98
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:12,973
We have a welcome
ceremony for new friends.

99
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:17,333
The whole village joins together
to build you your own cottage.

100
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,995
Not interested! You
may have them now,

101
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:22,395
but we're going to get
our Cutie Marks back!

102
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,226
Y'all don't understand, do ya?

103
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:26,573
You can't force
nopony to be friends!

104
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:27,840
It don't work like that!

105
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,791
Please, join us!

106
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,493
We love new friends!

107
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:36,031
It's all right, everypony, this
is a perfectly normal part

108
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:39,022
of the equalization process
for those who haven't...

109
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,115
quite seen the light yet.

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,102
We'll try again tomorrow,

111
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:48,808
once you've had a bit more time
to consider our philosophy.

112
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:56,880
I'd like to join!

113
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:02,928
Fluttershy?

114
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:04,551
How could you?

115
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:07,160
If giving up my Cutie
Mark means I get to stay

116
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:09,960
in this lovely village
with these lovely ponies,

117
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:11,564
then I'll do it.

118
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:17,426
We have a new
friend, everypony!

119
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:24,222
There's one more
order of business.

120
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,017
It seems some in
our midst might be

121
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:29,631
dissatisfied with
the village life!

122
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:33,711
Unfortunately, it's all
too true, my friends.

123
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:37,000
Will you kindly tell us the
names of those friends

124
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,524
who so desperately miss
their Cutie Marks

125
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:42,804
that they would sneak
around in the shadows

126
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:45,373
talking to
strangers about it?

127
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:50,217
Just so we can be sure your
intentions are, indeed, pure.

128
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:58,280
Um, I don't know
who they were.

129
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:02,262
Um. I'm sorry, I don't know
your names and faces yet.

130
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:06,724
Nonsense! Obviously these ponies
must have asked you directly.

131
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:08,853
Kindly point them out.

132
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,720
<i> It was me!</i>

133
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:19,364
It was only me.

134
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,728
I only wanted it back
for a little while.

135
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:25,760
And you're quite
certain it was only you?

136
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:28,720
I just wanted to remember
what it was like.

137
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:32,311
And no thought to the pain
you'd cause your friends.

138
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:35,142
Such selfishness.

139
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,022
I'm sorry, everypony!

140
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,915
I never wanted to
leave the village!

141
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:42,884
I love all of--

142
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:48,262
What was I thinking?

143
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,702
I can't believe I even
considered asking

144
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:52,275
for my Cutie Mark back.

145
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,648
Don't worry, Fluttershy will
have us out of here in no time.

146
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:57,760
Didn't you see what just
happened out there?

147
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,631
Your friend has
accepted our way.

148
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,271
You will all accept
our way.

149
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:03,017
It's only a matter
of time!

150
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:08,942
This guy's a
barrel of laughs.

151
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:10,697
Laughs don't come in barrels.

152
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:13,693
They come from inside you as
your body's response to delight.

153
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:17,084
So what are we gonna do while
Fluttershy's out there

154
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:19,853
lookin' for our Cutie Marks?

155
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,240
We have to stay as
positive as we can.

156
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,355
If Party Favor sees how much
we really do like each other,

157
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:26,808
even though we're all different,

158
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:28,795
maybe we can use him to
spread our message

159
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,160
to the rest
of the village.

160
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:33,053
<i> To excel is to fail...</i>

161
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:36,191
Let's just hope they don't
convert any of us first.

162
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:38,995
Welcome!

163
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:39,991
Welcome!

164
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:40,608
Welcome!

165
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:44,351
Gosh, you really are the
nicest ponies I've ever met.

166
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,604
Come, all new
friends stay with me

167
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:48,444
until their cottage
is completed.

168
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,640
Let's get you settled
and then you can enjoy

169
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:54,537
all that our little
village has to offer.

170
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,791
Get the Cutie Marks back.

171
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,280
That's all you've got
to do, Fluttershy.

172
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,493
Just sneak through the dark
to that spooky old cave

173
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:25,257
with the scary magical staff
and get the Cutie Marks back.

174
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:29,084
OK, you're doing great.

175
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:31,213
The cave's got
to be close now.

176
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,626
Excellent work,
Double Diamond.

177
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:36,773
Of course.

178
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:40,511
But I don't understand why you
wanted me to bring them here.

179
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:44,986
Fluttershy is one of us now;
surely she can be trusted.

180
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,902
This one belongs to a princess.

181
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,017
It could be very
important to our cause.

182
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:55,164
But if Twilight Sparkle
becomes our friend,

183
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:58,080
then what do we care
about this old Cutie Mark?

184
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,026
I just want to keep
them close.

185
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:02,888
Until everything
is...settled.

186
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:05,137
You may go, Double Diamond.

187
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:12,955
Oh dear!

188
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:16,177
How am I ever going to get
the Cutie Marks back now?

189
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:19,235
Ow!

190
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:25,604
Agh! Starlight,
you clumsy fool!

191
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,346
Oh no!

192
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,204
I've got a good
feeling about today!

193
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:02,097
So...do any of you have
anything you'd like to say?

194
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,177
Aw, a pity.

195
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:10,040
Well, let's try this
again tomorrow, shall we?

196
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,684
No new friends
today, I'm afraid!

197
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,453
Wait!

198
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,320
I'd like to lock them in.

199
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:22,835
Marvelous, Fluttershy,
that's the spirit!

200
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:26,413
Party Favor, will
you join us, please?

201
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,991
I'm sorry, Starlight!

202
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,911
I'm sorry, everypony!

203
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:34,288
I've seen the error of my ways!

204
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,142
I never want to look
at my Cutie Mark again!

205
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,706
It seems there's cause
for celebration after all!

206
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,875
They tried to break me!

207
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,502
They wouldn't stop talking
about how different they are,

208
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:50,191
and that somehow makes
their friendship stronger!

209
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,937
Such backwards thinking.

210
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:54,506
But I didn't listen!

211
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,786
I knew what they were up
to and I didn't listen!

212
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,875
Well done, Party Favor.

213
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:03,266
We welcome you back
with open hooves.

214
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:04,893
Um, Starlight?

215
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:08,368
I think we might have one
more friend joining us today.

216
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,480
Is this true?

217
00:12:13,204 --> 00:12:15,000
I...I think so.

218
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:17,022
But I just want to be sure.

219
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,884
If I agree to leave my
Cutie Mark in the vault,

220
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:21,613
I'll really be happier?

221
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,075
Just look around!

222
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:25,471
Equality has given
us more happiness

223
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:27,328
than you've ever known!

224
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,635
And you wouldn't let me just
live here in the village

225
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:31,257
with my old Cutie Mark?

226
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:33,000
Out of the question.

227
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,155
A pony with a different
Cutie Mark in our midst

228
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,551
would destroy our
entire philosophy.

229
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:39,920
We are all equal here!

230
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:43,764
Then how do 
you explain THIS?

231
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,608
I knew you couldn't
be trusted.

232
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,146
No! Get away!

233
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,044
Wha..What are you looking at?

234
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:02,146
They're the problem,
not me!

235
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:06,897
How could you?

236
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:09,435
You said Cutie
Marks were evil.

237
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:13,671
You said special talents
led to pain and heartache.

238
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:15,608
They do, don't you see?

239
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,017
Look at them!

240
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:17,977
Then why?

241
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:20,817
Why did you take ours
and not give up your own?

242
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,817
I..I had to, you fools!

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,862
How could I collect your
Cutie Marks without my magic?

244
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:29,160
But the staff has all
the magic we need!

245
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:32,000
The staff is a piece of
wood I found in the desert!

246
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,577
It's my magic that
makes all this possible!

247
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:37,382
You'd all still be living
your miserable lives,

248
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:39,840
thinking you're better
than everypony else,

249
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:42,466
if it weren't for my
magical abilities!

250
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:44,173
I brought you friendship!

251
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:45,893
I brought you equality!

252
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,222
I CREATED HARMONY!

253
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,235
You lied to us!

254
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:51,408
So what?

255
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,448
Everything else I
said is true!

256
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:56,973
The only way to be happy
is if we're all equal!

257
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:58,804
Except for you.

258
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:02,933
Everypony has unique talents
and gifts.

259
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,448
And when we share them with
each other, that's how real--

260
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:06,520
QUIET!

261
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,515
You can't have that
Cutie Mark, Starlight.

262
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:12,711
Either we're all equal
or none of us are.

263
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:28,342
Come on, let's get
our Cutie Marks back!

264
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,844
Yeah!

265
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,648
Come on!

266
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:35,608
Let's go get OUR
Cutie Marks!

267
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,004
Our Cutie Marks
aren't in the vault.

268
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:41,360
They're in there...with her!

269
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,515
STAND BACK, EVERYPONY!

270
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:21,253
Even without my Cutie Mark, I
can tell this is beautiful.

271
00:15:22,657 --> 00:15:25,493
They think they can come to
my village and disrupt my life?

272
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,702
Let's see how they like spending
the rest of their lives

273
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,351
without their
precious Cutie Marks!

274
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:44,253
Stand back, everypony!

275
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:53,577
They're gone!

276
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:55,004
They were right over there!

277
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:06,804
Look!

278
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,035
She's headed for the pass!

279
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,591
If she makes it into those
mountains, we'll never find her.

280
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:23,693
These are amazing!

281
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:25,982
There's a whole network
of caves up there.

282
00:16:26,146 --> 00:16:28,186
Your Cutie Marks
will be gone forever.

283
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:29,977
Then let's get movin', y'all!

284
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,022
Oh, come on!

285
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,093
Are you all so willing to
give up everything

286
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,297
because of these... strangers?

287
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:52,253
We gave up everything for you!

288
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,297
Because we thought
you were our friend!

289
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:59,066
I can't believe we have to
count on these other ponies

290
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:01,142
to save our Cutie Marks!

291
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:02,995
If we hadn't come
here to help them,

292
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:05,044
they'd still be living
under her rules!

293
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,173
Now it's their turn to help us!

294
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,204
And I know they can do it!

295
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,942
My newest recipe!

296
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:20,364
Snow pie!

297
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,928
She's gonna get away!

298
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,044
Whoa!

299
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,471
These are my old skis.

300
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,506
This is where I
first met Starlight.

301
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,360
Maybe you can
reminisce another time.

302
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:00,768
She's almost to the caves!

303
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:03,400
Feel like an airdrop?

304
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:32,422
Yee-haw!

305
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:35,191
Finally, I can buck like
a five-bit snake herder

306
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:36,928
in an Appleoosa
ranch house again!

307
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,568
And you got your
countryisms back, too!

308
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,928
I studied that spell for years!

309
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:03,897
How can you--?

310
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:07,342
I studied magic for years, too,
but what I didn't know then

311
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,720
was that studying could
only take me so far.

312
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:12,257
Each of my friends has taught
me something different

313
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,257
about myself.

314
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:16,297
It was their unique gifts and
passions and personalities

315
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,404
that helped bring out the
magic inside of me.

316
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:21,515
I never would have learned that
I represent the Element of Magic

317
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,764
without these five.

318
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,688
And I certainly wouldn't
be here to stop you now.

319
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,835
Spare me your
sentimental nonsense.

320
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:30,080
I gave these ponies
real friendships

321
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:31,906
they never could
have had otherwise!

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,382
How do you know that?

323
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,728
You never even gave us a chance.

324
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,804
She's getting away!

325
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,791
We'll never find her in there.

326
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:48,111
We just have to hope that
when she's had a chance

327
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:48,986
to think it over,

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,444
she realizes that you all
have taught her something.

329
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:54,497
It's you who have
taught us something.

330
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:57,351
We all came to this village
because we were searching

331
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,191
for something missing
from our lives.

332
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,506
We thought Starlight had
given it to us, but now...

333
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,244
...now it seems it was
in front of us all along.

334
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:06,866
It's us.

335
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,284
Does that mean you'll
stay in the village?

336
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:11,746
It's our home.

337
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:13,662
I'm not going anywhere.

338
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:18,057
This is a chance for all of us
to get to know each other again

339
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:20,146
for the very first time.

340
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:22,791
And I finally have a
chance to bake something

341
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:24,813
besides terrible muffins!

342
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:41,342
Now those are real smiles.

343
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,573
I'll never get used to that.

344
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,262
I think it's divine.

345
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:52,088
Does that mean the map is
calling us somewhere else?

346
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,008
I have a feeling it means
our work here is done.

347
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:57,017
Looks like you were right, Twilight.

348
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:59,333
The map did have a reason
for sendin' us here.

349
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,288
We brought real friendship
to these here ponies.

350
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:05,275
Guess that's why you're the
Princess of Friendship.

351
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,382
But the map didn't send me.

352
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:08,871
It sent us.

353
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,951
You're a part of me, all of you,

354
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,177
and there's no doubt you're
a part of my mission

355
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:14,848
to spread friendship, too.

356
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:18,862
This feels like an ending.

357
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:20,804
It doesn't have to be
an ending yet, right?

358
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:23,346
'Cause that Sugar
Belle can bake.

359
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,146
Maybe we can stay a
little while longer.

360
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:27,346
Come on!
