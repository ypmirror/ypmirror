2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,550
News from Northern Equestria!

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,550
Uh... your highness.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,330
Yes?

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,280
I am simply to tell you that...
it has returned.

6
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,281
( gasps )

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,330
Find Princess Cadance and Shining Armor.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,830
Yes, your highness.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,630
My dearest Twilight,
you must come to Canterlot at once.

00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,220
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:
Where are all my quills?

15
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,521
( pants )

16
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,870
No, no, no, no, no... ugh!

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,190
I need the Magical Compendium
volumes 1 to 36! Where is it?!

18
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:26,491
( dramatic theme playing )

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,390
Flash cards!
I should make some flash cards.

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,560
Spike, I'm gonna need you to quiz me.

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,720
On everything.
Everything I've ever learned. Ever.

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,120
That isn't gonna be enough cards.

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,870
Twilight, calm down.
It's just a test!

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,080
Just a test?

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,610
JUST A TEST?!

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,130
Princess Celestia wants
to give me some kind of exam

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,550
and you're trying to tell me to calm down
because... it's just a test?!

28
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,430
Uh... yes?

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,460
I'd say she's handling things
pretty well, considering.

30
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:12,122
( Twilight Sparkle screaming )

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,590
LUNA: Are you sure you
 don't want me to go as well?

32
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,450
CELESTIA: 
Yes.

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,190
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor
are already there.

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,280
The others will be joining them soon.

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,540
The empire's magic is powerful.
It cannot fall again, my sister.

36
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,860
She will succeed at her task.
And when she does,

37
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,790
we'll know she is that much closer
to being ready.

38
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,591
( clears throat )

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,870
Trust me, little sister.

40
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,710
You wanted to see me?
To give me a test?

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,690
I brought my own quills.
And plenty of paper to show my work.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,060
Sorry, sorry!

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,590
This is a different kind of test.

44
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,230
The Crystal Empire has returned.

45
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,660
The Crystal Empire?

46
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,790
I'm sorry, I thought I'd studied.

47
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,990
I don't think there's anything
in any of my books--

48
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,360
There wouldn't be.

49
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,530
Few remember it ever existed at all.

50
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,310
Even my knowledge of
the empire is limited.

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,220
What I do know is that
it contains a powerful magic.

52
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,040
One thousand years ago,

53
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,790
King Sombra, a unicorn
whose heart was black as night,

54
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,930
took over the Crystal Empire.

55
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,470
<i>He was ultimately overthrown,</i>

56
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,700
<i>turned to shadow and banished
to the ice of the arctic north.</i>

57
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,710
But not before he was able to
put a curse upon the empire.

58
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,600
A curse that caused it
to vanish into thin air.

59
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,010
If the empire is filled with
hope and love,

60
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,140
those things are reflected
across all of Equestria.

61
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,150
If hatred and fear take hold...

62
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:22,321
<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

63
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,870
Which is why I need your help
finding a way to protect it.

64
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,920
You want me to help protect
an entire empire?

65
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,460
It is, as I said, a different kind of test.

66
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,890
But one I'm certain you will pass.

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,210
How do I begin?

68
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,900
By joining Princess Cadance and
Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire.

69
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,420
My brother is there?

70
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,140
He is. And your Ponyville friends
will join you there as well.

71
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,220
I have every confidence
you will succeed.

72
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,480
And when you do,

73
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,450
I'll know you are ready to move on
to the next level of your studies.

74
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,700
But what if I fail?

75
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,560
You won't.

76
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,910
But what if--

77
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,650
You won't.
But Twilight,

78
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,740
in the end, it must be you
and you alone

79
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,840
who ultimately assists
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor

80
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,760
in doing what needs to be done
to protect the empire.

81
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,640
Do you understand?

82
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,620
Then go. There is no time to lose.

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,990
Ah! Twilight! That was fast!

84
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,240
Let me guess, you got a perfect score?

85
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,250
A minus?

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,810
B plus?

87
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,400
Twilight! Did you... fail?

88
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:01,860
<i>I was prepared to do my best,
Thought I could handle any test </i>

89
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:10,230
<i>For I can do so many tricks,
But I wasn't prepared for this </i>

90
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,780
<i>Levitation would have been a breeze</i>

91
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,480
<i>Facts and figures I recite with ease </i>

92
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,100
The square root
of five hundred and forty-six

93
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,230
is twenty-three point three six six six
four two eight nine one zero nine.

94
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,920
She is correct!

95
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,250
<i>I could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss </i>

96
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,580
<i>But I wasn't prepared for this </i>

97
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:48,520
<i>Will I fail, or will I pass?
I can't be sure...  </i>

98
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,370
<i>She can't be sure... </i>

99
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,600
<i>My mind is sharp, my skills intact
My heart is pure...</i>

100
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,700
<i>Her heart is pure... </i>

101
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,430
<i>Oh, I've taken my share of licks</i>

102
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,400
<i>I've made it through the thin and thick </i>

103
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,570
<i>- But no I wasn't
- Oh no, she wasn't </i>

104
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,530
<i>- But no I wasn't
- Oh no, she wasn't </i>

105
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:23,260
<i>No I wasn't prepared for this! </i>

106
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,010
Uh, prepared for what exactly?

107
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,290
APPLEJACK: 
Twilight!

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,410
Did you pass?

109
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,370
Are we gonna celebrate
your awesomeness with Princess Celestia?

110
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,690
TWILIGHT:
Not quite.

111
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,960
We're going to the Crystal Empire!

112
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,600
Ha! And you all made fun of me
for packing so many scarves.

113
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,330
I didn't say a word.

114
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,800
SHINING ARMOR:
Twilight!

115
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,210
Shining Armor?

116
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,720
Twilie! You made it.

117
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,170
We better get moving.

118
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,980
There are things out here we really
don't want to run into after dark.

119
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,570
What kind of things?

120
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,550
Let's just say the empire...

121
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,590
isn't the only thing that's returned.

122
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,650
Something keeps trying to get in!

123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,070
We think it's the unicorn king
who originally cursed the place.

124
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,650
But Princess Celestia said I was being sent
here to find a way to protect the empire!

125
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,770
If King Sombra can't get in,
then it must already be protected.

126
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,071
( creature howling distantly )

127
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,300
Th-That's one of the things, isn't it?!

128
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,280
We have to get to
the Crystal Empire. Now!

129
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,297
( snarling )

130
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,400
Go, go!

131
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,400
SHINING ARMOR:
Almost there.

132
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,100
( sighs )

133
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:36,380
Everypony okay?

134
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:37,999
( ponies pant )

135
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,520
Oh no, Shining Armor,
your horn!

136
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,610
Sparklriffic!

137
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,590
RARITY: It's gorgeous!
Absolutely gorgeous!

138
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:06,600
( stammers )

139
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,920
There are no words!

140
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,790
Focus, Rarity.
We're here to help Twilight.

141
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,650
Not admire the scenery.

142
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,520
RAINBOW DASH: 
I don't see what the big deal is.
Just looks like another old castle to me.

143
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:19,770
( scoffs and spits )

144
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,100
Another old...!

145
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,750
Have you lost your mind?!
Look at the magn--

146
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,751
( laughs )

147
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,590
Very funny.

148
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,060
Cadance!

149
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:45,100
BOTH: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake,
clap your hooves and do a little shake!

150
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,101
( both laugh )

151
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,090
One of these days,
we need to get together

152
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,200
when the fate of Equestria
isn't hanging in the balance.

153
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,450
Are you okay?

154
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,540
Cadance has been able to use her magic
to spread love and light.

155
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,850
That seems to be what is protecting it.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,600
But she hasn't slept, barely eats.

157
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,650
I want to help her, but my protection spell
has been countered by King Sombra.

158
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,530
It's alright Shining Armor, I'm fine.

159
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,960
She's not fine.
She can't go on like this forever.

160
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,550
And if her magic were to fade,

161
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,400
you saw what's out there
waiting for that to happen.

162
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,890
That's why we're here.

163
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,250
APPLEJACK:
Why we're all here.

164
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:23,851
ALL:
Mm-hmm.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,080
With Cadance putting all her strength
into keeping her spell going,

166
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,060
and me trying to keep an eye
on signs of trouble in the arctic,

167
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,450
we haven't been able to gather
much information from the Crystal Ponies.

168
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,750
Crystal Ponies?!
( laughs )

169
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,410
There are Crystal Ponies?!

170
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,850
Please, continue.

171
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,490
But we have to believe one of them
knows how we can protect the empire,

172
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,810
without having to use
Cadance's magic.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,430
A research paper!

174
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,760
That must be part of my test!

175
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,340
To gather information from the
crystal ponies and deliver it to you!

176
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,240
This is gonna be great!
I love research papers!

177
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,650
Yeah, who doesn't?

178
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,940
Ohohoh! Lemme guess!

179
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,390
Is it Spike?!
No no, Fluttershy! Rarity?

180
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,200
Don't worry, big brother.
I'm really good at this sort of thing.

181
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,240
TWILIGHT:
Are you sure? Absolutely sure?

182
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,800
I'm sorry. I wish I could help you.

183
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,250
But I can't seem to remember anything
before King Sombra came to power.

184
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,040
And I don't want to remember anything
about the time he ruled over us.

185
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,030
( shuddering )

186
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,230
King Sombra's spell must be
why their coats aren't... crystally.

187
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,520
Have we really been gone
a thousand years?

188
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,520
Yes.

189
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,640
It feels like it was just yesterday.

190
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,010
If you think of anything,
even the smallest thing...

191
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,440
Of course.

192
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,400
That was a total bust.

193
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,640
Maybe the others are having better luck.

194
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,930
A way to protect the empire!
You know anything about it or what?!

195
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,070
I wish I could help you. Really.

196
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,300
Come on! You gotta know something!

197
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,170
But... I don't have any information.

198
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,450
Oh, um. Excuse me!

199
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,880
Oh, hello!
I was just wondering...

200
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,460
Oh, oh that's okay.
You all look really busy...

201
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:23,700
( laughs nervously )

202
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,970
Time to gather some intel!

203
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,050
It just feels like something is missing.

204
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,100
I know.

205
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,400
It looks the same, but...
it doesn't feel the same.

206
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,880
PINKIE PIE:
Because it isn't!

207
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,760
A spy!

208
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:43,761
( screams )

209
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,550
A spy?!
How did they know?

210
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,240
Ah! Must have noticed
my night vision goggles.

211
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,970
Ooh! Night visiony!

212
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:54,971
( hums )

213
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,810
And when you flip your mane,
it simply must create a rainbow of color.

214
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,280
Wouldn't I look just magnificent?

215
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,360
So sparkly!

216
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:11,661
( giggles )

217
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,570
I got nothing so far.

218
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,750
Me neither.

219
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,310
My cover has been blown.
I repeat, my cover has been blown!

220
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,180
Ooookay.

221
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,530
Sorry, Twilight,

222
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,320
these crystal ponies seem to have
some kinda collective amnesia or somethin'.

223
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,700
Only thing I was able to get out of 'em
was somethin' about a library.

224
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:39,660
( gasps )

225
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,340
A library?
Why didn't you say so?!

226
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,550
Uh... thought I just did.

227
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,360
I just... I don't even know what to...

228
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,520
There are no words.

229
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,700
( clears throat )

230
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,400
May I help you?

231
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,410
Yes. We're looking for a book.

232
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
We have plenty of those.

233
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,000
You do. You really do!

234
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,070
We're lookin' for a history book.

235
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,990
Somethin' that may tells us how
the empire might've protected itself

236
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,740
from danger back in the day.

237
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,420
Yes, of course.
History, history...

238
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,790
Ah, yes!

239
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,930
Which is where, exactly?

240
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,530
I... I can't seem to remember.
I'm not sure I actually work here.

241
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,930
We'll just take a look around.
I'm sure we can find it on our own.

242
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,020
Let me know if you find anything.

243
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,190
I like her!

244
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,830
Anyone else startin' to think
this is a lost cause?

245
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,000
No, no, no, no,
no...

246
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,310
YES!

247
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,650
TWILIGHT: 
History of the Crystal Empire.

248
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,350
I just hope it has
the answers we need.

249
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,110
A 'Crystal Fair'.

250
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,370
According to this book,
it was established by their first queen,

251
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,790
and became their
most important tradition.

252
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,070
The fair was held every year to

253
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,100
renew the spirit of love
and unity in the empire

254
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,040
so they could protect it from harm.

255
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,990
My friends and I could put it together.
Everything we need to know is in the book!

256
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,920
That sounds pretty promising.

257
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,230
We'll get started right away.

258
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,750
Come on, Spike.
We've got a Crystal Fair to put together!

259
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,051
( groans )

260
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:10,040
<i>Princess Cadance needs our help,
Her magic will not last forever </i>

261
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,750
<i>I think we can do it,
But we need to work together </i>

262
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,540
<i>We have to get this right,
Yes we have to make them see </i>

263
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:25,410
<i>We can save the Crystal Ponies
with their history </i>

264
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,590
<i>It says that they like jousting </i>

265
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,220
<i>They flew a flag of many hues </i>

266
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,530
<i>Made sweets with crystal berries </i>

267
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,680
<i>They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes</i>

268
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,570
<i>Oh we have to get this right,
Yes we have to make them see </i>

269
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,690
<i>We can save the Crystal Ponies
with their history </i>

270
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,400
<i>There was a crystal flugelhorn</i>

271
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,150
<i>That everypony liked to play </i>

272
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,230
<i>And the Crystal Kingdom anthem </i>

273
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,560
<i>Can you learn it in a day? </i>

274
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,850
<i>Oh we have to get this right,
Yes we have to make them see </i>

275
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,170
<i>We can save the Crystal Ponies</i>

276
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,820
<i>With their history </i>

277
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,150
It looks amazing!

278
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,790
I don't know how
I could have done this without you!

279
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,600
One last check to make sure
everything is in place,

280
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,500
and then the festivities can begin!

281
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,900
What's this thing for?

282
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,070
The last page of the book mentioned
a Crystal Heart as the fair's centerpiece.

283
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,010
So I used my magic to cut one
out of a crystal block.

284
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,450
Nice work, Twi.

285
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,820
Think we're ready to get
this fair up and runnin'.

286
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:55,901
( inhaling deeply )

287
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,654
( playing off-key notes )

288
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,420
Hear ye, hear--

289
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,821
( playing off-key notes )

290
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,790
My bad.
( laughs nervously )

291
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,450
Hear ye, hear ye.
Princess Cadance

292
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,700
and Prince Shining Armor
do cordially

293
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,690
invite you to attend
the Crystal Fair!

294
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,327
( Crystal Ponies murmuring )

295
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,180
Come on in, y'all.

296
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,350
Got food and drinks thataway,
games and crafts are thataway,

297
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,950
Crystal Heart to the back
near the Princess.

298
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,275
CROWD: 
Did she say 'Crystal Heart'?

299
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,690
We totally nailed it, right?

300
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,220
Must be feeling a lot of love
and unity about now!

301
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,190
Gonna have some grub, huh?

302
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,000
What are you picking?
Crystal Empire berry pie?

303
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,800
Maybe some crystal corn-on-the-cob!

304
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,880
What is with these ponies?!

305
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,290
Seeing all of this, I feel like
I'm starting to remember.

306
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,850
Remember things from before the king.

307
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,250
Me too.

308
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:11,684
( gasps )
( gasps )

309
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:13,140
BOTH:
The Crystal Heart!

310
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,650
Do you think they really have it?

311
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,550
Of course we have it!

312
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,470
Can't have a Crystal Fair
without the Crystal Heart, right?

313
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,550
Of course you can't.

314
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,410
The whole purpose of the Crystal Fair
is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies,

315
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,380
so the light within them
can power the Crystal Heart,

316
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,440
so that the empire can be protected!

317
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,240
I do work at a library!

318
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,040
What's that about
'powering the heart'?

319
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,080
I just can't believe you found it.

320
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,440
King Sombra said he'd hidden it away,
where we would never see it again!

321
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,990
I only hope it will still be
as powerful after all these years!

322
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,170
Mmm, funnel cake!

323
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:49,013
( squeaks )

324
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,340
Why did you--?

325
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,050
I think we may have a problem!

326
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,090
I didn't know it was an actual relic!

327
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,510
The book didn't mention anything about
the Crystal Ponies powering the Heart!

328
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,370
There was a page missing...
how did I not notice?!

329
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,200
It's alright, Twilight.

330
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,220
Twilie...

331
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,621
( creature howling distantly )

332
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:22,084
( ominous theme playing )

333
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:25,885
( wind howling )

334
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:37,396
( ending theme song playing )
