1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,640
I love it when Princess Celestia
comes to Ponyville!

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,400
I got my hooves shined
just like Rarity for the occasion.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,410
- Ya like?
- I certainly do!

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm surprised she's not here yet.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,580
I wonder what's taking so long?

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,500
And where are
Applejack and Fluttershy?

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,300
Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack
with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,380
They'll be along.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,160
I still don't get why
the Princess would be so late.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,270
She's bringing
an important visitor.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,710
That could be part of it.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,450
A visitor who's important and slow.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,430
Maybe it's somepony
so terribly important,

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,600
she still had many more terribly important
things to do before she got here.

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,900
Maybe the visitor has a deer antler,
a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,200
Yeah, right. That's Discord.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,000
Why in the
wide-wide world of Equestria

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,820
would Princess Celestia
bring along someone like that?

19
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,320
Maybe you should ask her!

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,210
With all due respect,
Princess Celestia,

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
how could you bring Discord here?!

25
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
Your majesty.

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,220
I'm fully aware that
the last time Discord was here,

27
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,680
he created serious havoc.

28
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,920
If by "serious havoc"
you mean

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,860
"turning Ponyville into
the chaos capital of the world".

30
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,720
And tricking us all into being
the opposite of our true selves.

31
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,570
And making yummy delicious
chocolate milk rain all over the place,

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,790
without a single dollop of whipped cream
to go with it anywhere in sight!

33
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,910
Not a single dollop!

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,200
Yes, I understand.

35
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,100
But I have use for Discord's magic,

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,550
if it can be reformed
to serve good instead of evil.

37
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,000
This is why
I've brought Discord here,

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,430
because I believe you are the ponies
who can help him do just that.

39
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,550
This will never work!
This is a disaster!

40
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,020
How will we control him?!
We're doomed!

41
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,320
Need I remind you
that you are the ponies

42
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,220
who turned him back into stone
like this in the first place?

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,220
I suppose we can just use
the Elements of Harmony

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,820
against him again
if he gets out of hand...

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,910
We probably need a volunteer

46
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,990
to run away from here
right away to get them.

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,480
- I'll do it!
- No need, Spike.

48
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,940
I have them right here.

49
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,420
And I've cast a spell so Discord
can't take them and hide them again.

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,070
Now where is Fluttershy?

51
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,620
I believe she may know best
how to begin reforming Discord.

52
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,820
Fluttershy? Really?

53
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,120
- What's he goin' on about now?
- Good news.

54
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,870
Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed
to take his dam apart and move it.

55
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,550
Well, it's about time.

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,650
My apple trees are so waterlogged
I can practically hear 'em gargle!

57
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,570
But he says first you'll have
to apologize for calling him...

58
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,950
"a nuisance".

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,670
Apologize?!
He's lucky I didn't call him a varmint!

60
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:40,580
Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth!
Such a language!

61
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,320
Fine, fine.

62
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,090
I apologize.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,170
Thanks, Fluttershy.

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,970
Don't know what
I would've done without ya.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,290
Glad I could help.

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,770
Hey, slackers!

67
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,880
Double time it over to Ponyville,
would ya?

68
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,230
We're all waiting on you!

69
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,320
I realize that this is a tall order,

70
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,270
but I wouldn't ask
if I weren't confident

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,620
you could get him to use magic
obediently of his own free will.

72
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,860
And you really think
I'll know best how to do that?

73
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,080
I do.

74
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,160
Now, I must return to Canterlot
for Equestria's royal summit.

75
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,680
You may release Discord when ready.

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,380
Okay, ponies,
guess it's time to get started.

77
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,550
Let's just hope
this releasing spell works.

78
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,940
Or... let's not.

79
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,610
We'd best keep our elements on
at all times until further notice.

80
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
Check!

81
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,280
Well, it's about time somepony
got me out of that prison block.

82
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,200
What a relief!

83
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,690
What do you think you're doing?!

84
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,870
Why, stretching of course.

85
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,340
When you're a creature of chaos,

86
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,320
stone bodysuits aren't
your typical go-to fashion choice.

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,330
Make that bunny cute again! Now!

88
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,120
He is adorable the way he is.

89
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,770
You know what else is adorable?

90
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,890
You ponies truly believe
that you can reform me,

91
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,990
and that you're putting your faith
in this one here to make it happen.

92
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,660
Makes me wanna pinch
your little horsey cheeks...

93
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,000
How'd you know about that?!

94
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,360
Being turned to stone doesn't keep me
from hearing every word Celestia says.

95
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,990
Although I admit
it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.

96
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,130
Well, unless you want us
to turn you back to stone,

97
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,160
you'll zap those animals back
the way they were pronto!

98
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,660
Oh, you wouldn't dare
turn me back to stone

99
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,180
and risk disappointing
your precious princess.

100
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,310
Try us, "Dip-cord"!

101
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,700
You think you can treat
poor defenseless animals like that

102
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,220
and get away with it?!

103
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,920
You go, Fluttershy!

104
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,060
You'd best watch your step, buster,
or I'll give you the Stare!

105
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,030
The Stare?
Oh no, please, not that!

106
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,930
Anything but
your disapproving eyeballs!

107
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,580
Oh no! No no no, stop!

108
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,970
Stop! I can't take it any more!

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,710
I'll do whatever you say!
Because...

110
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,820
You are hilarious!

111
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,380
If it turns out we need to use
our elements against you,

112
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,270
I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia
it was for a good reason!

113
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,770
I suppose that's correct.

114
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,020
Oopsie!

115
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,050
Well, it looks like I know
where I'll be crashing

116
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,090
while I'm being "reformed"...

117
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,730
With you, Fluttershy.

118
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,340
Oh, dear.

119
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,200
He may be horrible,

120
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,770
but that doesn't mean
we have to act the same way.

121
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,070
We should at least
try to be hospitable.

122
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,060
You don't mind giving up
your favorite spot on the couch,

123
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,790
do you, Angel Bunny?

124
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,210
Oh, I'm sorry about Angel.
Are you alright?

125
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,380
Oh, yes. Thank you,
Fluttershy, for your concern.

126
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,480
If only your pony friends
could be as considerate...

127
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,100
Don't listen to him, Fluttershy!

128
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,130
He's just trying to drive a wedge
between us, like he always does.

129
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,460
Now why in the world would
I ever try to do a thing like that?

130
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,910
So we can't unite and use the Elements
of Harmony against you, that's why!

131
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,300
I never thought of that...

132
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,000
You big liar!

133
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,730
Now, look who's a liar.

134
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,340
Anyone can plainly see
that I'm not big at all.

135
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,830
Oops.

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,760
There, all better.

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,280
I can't watch...

138
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,990
We'll be outside.

139
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,620
You sure you're okay with this?

140
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,840
I know it's not gonna be easy,
but Princess Celestia's counting on me.

141
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,600
And I think
I actually know what to do.

142
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,340
You do?

143
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,990
I think the key is to befriend him.

144
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,760
Being kind to him and letting him
be my house guest

145
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,790
is probably
the best way to do that.

146
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,910
- And you really think that'll work?
- I think it's worth a try.

147
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,760
Okay, but if you need us,
all you need to do is whisper "help",

148
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,990
and we'll be back here
with our Elements.

149
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,390
So watch that
goat-legged step of yours, pal!

150
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,530
What?! Look at me!
I'm practically reformed already.

151
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,740
She's really alright
with him staying there?

152
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,970
That's what she said.

153
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,490
Personally, I think we should
come up with a backup plan,

154
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,580
in case this whole "befriending"
business doesn't work out.

155
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,940
Rainbow Dash is right.

156
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,880
This is Discord we're talking about,
girls.

157
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,270
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to have another trick up our sleeves.

158
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,600
And I think I know just the trick.

159
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,350
Discord? Oh, there you are.

160
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,450
Listen, Discord, I just want
to make sure you know that

161
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,180
if there's anything I can do to--

162
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,070
Are you eating... paper?

163
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,890
Am I? How odd of me.

164
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,300
Well, um...

165
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm just heading out, so,
make yourself at home while I'm gone.

166
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,210
Bye-bye, have a nice time!

167
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,010
Everything is fine here, bye bye...

168
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,840
You like carrots, Angel?

169
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,350
I'm playing your owner for a fool!

170
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,370
How d'ya like them carrots?

171
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,410
That's weird.
The spell I had in mind isn't in here.

172
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,090
Spike, where are the other books
I asked you to pull?

173
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,290
Right here, Twilight.

174
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,420
I really want to have a
reforming spell up and running pronto.

175
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,440
But what if he makes the
Elements of Harmony disappear

176
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,830
like he did last time?

177
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,960
Princess Celestia cast a spell
protecting them, remember?

178
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,200
What's wrong?

179
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,490
Princess Celestia didn't cast a spell
protecting our books!

180
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,000
Everywhere I thought
I'd find the reforming spell...

181
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,550
Are you sure
this isn't overdoing?

182
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,790
You said to make myself at home
while you were gone,

183
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,560
but I wouldn't want
to overstep my bounds.

184
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,540
I did say that, so...

185
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,060
if this makes you more comfortable,
by all means, please feel free.

186
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,190
Well, it does, very much so.

187
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,240
You're so very kind,
my dear Fluttershy.

188
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,790
I always knew that you were
the understanding one,

189
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,650
not like those nasty friends of yours.

190
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,000
My friends aren't nasty!

191
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,930
Of course you'd say that,

192
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,190
it just goes to show
how understanding you truly are.

193
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,940
You know,
I think Princess Celestia is right

194
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,300
when she singles you out
as the one who could reform me.

195
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,100
You're off to such a good start
I'm seriously considering actually

196
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,070
being reformed.

197
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,340
Fluttershy!
Fluttershy, can you hear me?!

198
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,440
Goodness! I hear Twilight!

199
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,980
Fluttershy, what's going on?
Are you okay?!

200
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,160
We're fine, everything's going great.
Isn't it, Angel?

201
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,300
We've come to get you away
from Discord!

202
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,490
He's just terrible and,
from the looks of it,

203
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,220
completely out of control!

204
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,090
Oh, but you're wrong!
We're making great progress!

205
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,930
Seriously?!

206
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,900
I'm earning his trust by giving him
a little space to be himself.

207
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,500
Hate to break it to you,
but he used that "space to be himself"

208
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,850
to tear out all the reforming spells
from the library!

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,850
That does explain the paper eating...

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
He ate them?!

211
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,100
But we aren't gonna need a spell.

212
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,740
He's already really
considering being reformed!

213
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,870
He said so.

214
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,330
And you believed him?!

215
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,340
If I'm going to be his friend,
I have to start by giving him

216
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,540
the benefit of the doubt!

217
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,120
Tell you what. Bring all the ponies over
for a dinner party this evening,

218
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,340
and I bet his manners
will have really improved by then.

219
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,420
I'll even get him to put the cottage
back on the ground first.

220
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,840
Alright. Dinner it is...

221
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,530
I can't believe we're having
a dinner party with Discord!

222
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,890
This evening
is sure to be a disaster.

223
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,520
Glad I didn't bother wearing
my fanciest outfit.

224
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,190
Fluttershy thinks this is the way
to reform Discord

225
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,990
and asked us
to give it a chance.

226
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,840
Oh, our pony guests!

227
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,750
We're so delighted
that you've come.

228
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,530
Please, do come in.

229
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,330
See what a beautiful job
he did helping?

230
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,240
Discord set the entire table himself.

231
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,850
I'm so proud.

232
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,720
May I take your...
hats, ladies?

233
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,840
Hang on to your elements, girls.
It's gonna be a bumpy night.

234
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,790
As you all know,
Princess Celestia hoped

235
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,030
we'd help Discord use his magic
for good, instead of evil.

236
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,900
Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?

237
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,870
You bet!

238
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,790
Allow me.

239
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,840
Oh, what a cute little
gravy boat you are!

240
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,270
Yes you are! Yes you are!

241
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,880
That's one creepy little
gravy boat if you ask me.

242
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,710
Oh, come on now, Dashie,
you're not even giving this a chance.

243
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,550
Hey! That's hot!

244
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,210
Whoops! I'm so sorry!

245
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,770
He did that on purpose!

246
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,190
I don't know about that.
Mistakes happen.

247
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,230
Oh, look, everypony,
dancing candles!

248
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,630
I'm not falling for that!

249
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,290
Discord's just trying
to distract us from--

250
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,540
Hey! Knock it off!

251
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,410
I suppose that's another "mistake"?

252
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,360
No, I think you just made them mad.

253
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,430
There's something fishy going on.

254
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,180
Discord!

255
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,430
Well it's hardly my fault
if the soup tureen

256
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,380
finds the term "something fishy"
to be offensive.

257
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,400
Not the dress. Not the dress!

258
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,060
That tureen's only doin'
what you're makin' it do!

259
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,780
Now let's not jump
to any conclusions.

260
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,870
Fluttershy,
can't you see what he's doing?

261
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,490
He's playing innocent with you
so you'll never agree to use

262
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,860
the Elements of Harmony
against him!

263
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,700
Well, that's a bit harsh,
isn't it?

264
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,820
You see what I'm saying,
right, Fluttershy?

265
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,500
Fluttershy!

266
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,790
You know what I see?

267
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,200
I see that
Discord's far from perfect,

268
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,910
but I also see none of you
giving him a chance!

269
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,350
What's gotten into you?!

270
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,540
Why do you keep cutting him
so much slack?!

271
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,270
Because that's what friends do.

272
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
We're friends?

273
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,240
Why, of course!

274
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,340
I can't ever remember my house being
this lively before you came along.

275
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,340
Oh. Well, I've...
never really had a friend before.

276
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,140
Well now you do!

277
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,200
Now is not a good time, Angel.
We're having a dinner party.

278
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,110
Hold up! I think he's tryin'
to tell us somethin'!

279
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,490
Apple!

280
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,040
Applejack!

281
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,740
Sweet Apple Acres?

282
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,440
Flooding at Sweet Apple Acres!

283
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,920
And we all know who's
behind that now, don't we?!

284
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,420
Who, me?

285
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,000
Oh, give it a rest!

286
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,380
What do you think of your
"friend" now, Fluttershy?

287
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,490
I've never seen
the floodin' this bad!

288
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,020
They've built dams round here before,
but never like this!

289
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,750
What's goin' on?

290
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,790
Such language!

291
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,840
It's no use.
They won't listen to a word I say!

292
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,290
You see Discord's
behind all this, right?

293
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,150
Oh, of course I do!

294
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,640
Do you all think I'm a silly,
gullible fool?!

295
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,400
I've just been trying to gain
his friendship any way I can,

296
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,000
so he'd come to trust
and listen to me!

297
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,050
Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn?
The water's great!

298
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,500
Time to see if it worked.

299
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,550
Fluttershy, there you are.

300
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,490
A sight for sore eyes.

301
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,670
As you can see, there's a big mess
down here at Sweet Apple Acres.

302
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,200
Oh, yes. Awful business, that.

303
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,550
It is awful.

304
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,200
This is Applejack's home,
and it's being destroyed

305
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,800
by innocent creatures
who would never be acting this way

306
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,670
if it weren't for
your reckless behavior.

307
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,100
You need to fix this.

308
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,050
Very well, I will fix it.
I only ask one thing in return.

309
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes?

310
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,180
I ask that you never use
your Element of Harmony against me.

311
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,160
As a sign of our friendship.

312
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,370
I will never use
my Element of Harmony against you.

313
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,140
Excellent!

314
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,050
There, much better!

315
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,350
I do prefer ice skating
to water skiing! Don't you?

316
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,020
Discord!

317
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,270
That's not fixing it!

318
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,190
Why, I oughta...

319
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,070
Where are you going?

320
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,560
- What's wrong, pal?
- Don't call me your pal!

321
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,900
Come skating with me,
and we'll let bygones be bygones.

322
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,380
Here you go, Fluttershy!
Game on!

323
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,120
He fixes this or
he goes back to being stone!

324
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,510
Princess Celestia will understand!

325
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,000
I made a promise not to use
my element against him

326
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,550
and I'm going to keep it.

327
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,380
You see?

328
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,320
She wants to have fun with me
because we're friends.

329
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,810
She can't use the elements against me
because we're friends.

330
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,330
I'm free forever!

331
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,060
Not. Your. Friend!

332
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,550
Who cares?

333
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want.

334
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,610
I'm Discord, the master of chaos!

335
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,510
You think
you can boss Discord around?

336
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,050
You think I'm just going to
turn all this back because you say so?

337
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,390
Because if I don't
I'll lose the one friend I ever had?

338
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,450
Well played, Fluttershy.

339
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,610
Well played.

340
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,530
I liked it better my way, but...
I guess when you're friends,

341
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,600
you can't always have things
exactly your way all the time, eh?

342
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,920
Yes, Princess,
I'm ready to use my magic

343
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,710
for good instead of evil.

344
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,320
Most of the time.

345
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,050
Congratulations on your success,
ponies.

346
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,570
I definitely sense
a big change in Discord.

347
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,050
I'll leave the Elements of Harmony
with you, Twilight.

348
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,970
Just in case.

349
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,510
You were right
when you said Fluttershy

350
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,330
would be the one to find
the way to reform Discord.

351
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,130
By treating Discord as a friend,

352
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,240
she got him to realize
that friendship

353
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,420
was actually important to him.

354
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,010
And something that, once he had,
he didn't want to lose.

355
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,300
Go on. Say it...

356
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,780
Alright...
Friendship is magic!

357
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,670
See?
He can be a real sweetheart

358
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,510
once you get to know him.
