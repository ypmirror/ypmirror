            [slurp]             

127
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,583
       THIS NOT YAK SNOW!       

128
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,452
    [crashing and growling]     

129
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,420
           Seriously?           

130
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,422
           Seriously?           

131
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,530
    You know? It's going OK.    

132
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,732
     Satisfactory, I'd say.     

133
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,834
      It could be better.       

134
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,070
      It's not very good.       

135
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,972
        It's a disaster!        

136
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,775
     Pinkie Pie. Tonight's      
    Yakyakistan-theme party     

137
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,510
  is more important than ever.  

138
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,579
  You'll make them forget all   
  about this afternoon, right?  

139
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,582
  Because if it's not perfect,  

140
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,551
        they're going to        
       smash everything,        

141
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,988
 and I'm not sure how much more 
 smashing this visit can take!  

142
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,125
       I definitely will,       
       I think... maybe?        

143
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,095
   You're the best gosh-darn    
  party planner in Equestria.   

144
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,930
  You'll show 'em a good time.  

145
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,698
         You can do it.         

146
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,569
 We have absolute confidence in 
  your abilities, Pinkie Pie.   

147
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,639
    It's going to be my most    
  happy-tacular party ever...   

148
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,740
            I hope!             

149
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,611
       Why are your eyes        
   darting around like that?    

150
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,915
  It's what I do when I'm not   
    nervous! Hahahahahahaha!    

151
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,118
    Pinkie Pie, I don't know    
   what we'd do without you.    

152
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,553
      Me either! GOTTA GO!      

153
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:44,196
       [gasping breaths]        

154
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,097
   Gummy! What am I gonna do?   

155
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,467
    I have all this amazing     
  stuff planned for the party   

156
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,868
 but they're going to hate it!  

157
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,804
There's no way to make Equestria
     feel like Yakyakistan.     

158
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,941
  They're just too sensitive.   

159
00:07:55,943 --> 00:08:01,880
      Even Fluttershy made      
     them mad. FLUTTERSHY!      

160
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:05,050
     Oh, I need a new idea,     
       and I need it now.       

161
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,986
 How am I supposed to make this 
  party feel like Yakyakistan   

162
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,689
  without actually going there  
  and bringing something back?  

163
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,860
             [gasp]             

164
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,862
    Gummy, you're a genius!     

165
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:17,829
             [kiss]             

166
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,700
 And this is Sugarcube Corner.  

167
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,936
They're working hard to make you
a traditional Yakyakistan cake. 

168
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,873
        VANILLA EXTRACT         
      BALANCE VERY TRICKY!      

169
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,644
    Do you mind, um, waiting    
      here for one moment?      

170
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:33,945
 How's tonight's party coming?  

171
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:38,550
 I'm doing what I can, but it's 
really up to you at this point. 

172
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,154
     Pinkie? Where are you?     

173
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:51,696
       Did you find her?        

174
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,933
      Angel and I searched      
       the forest, but...       

175
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,770
      Aerial recon turned       
      up nothing, either.       

176
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,107
   I searched the farm inside   
    and out. No Pinkie Pie.     

177
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,309
    But I did find a set of     
    Granny Smith's dentures     

178
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:08,146
   under the house. So...not    
        a complete loss.        

179
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,981
     She's simply vanished!     

180
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,718
But the party, it's all we have 
 left. What are we going to do? 

181
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,726
   "Don't worry. I'll be back   
     in time for the party.     

182
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:21,726
       Love, Pinkie Pie."       

183
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,098
  If Pinkie Pie says she'll be  
  back in time for the party,   

184
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,098
        she'll be back.         

185
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,137
  We have to trust her. Right?  
    No reason to FREAK OUT.     

186
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,939
     Don't worry, Twilight.     

187
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,140
   When it comes to parties,    

188
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,342
       I think she knows        
       what she's doing.        

189
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:37,342
             [sigh]             

190
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:41,813
 You're right, let's just focus 
   on keeping the yaks happy    

191
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,214
        till she's back.        

192
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,116
         Piece of cake.         

193
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,918
           The cake!            

194
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,820
      One bite and you'll       
         be transported         

195
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,056
         right back to          
      Yakyakistan. Ha ha!       

196
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,658
            I hope.             

197
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,730
           [munching]           

198
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:02,867
      PONIES TOO HEAVY ON       
     VANILLA EXTRACT! BWAR!     

199
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,071
       We've never needed       
       a party so badly.        

200
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,013
   Next stop, Crystal Empire!   

201
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,951
    And so my quest begins.     

202
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,620
  I know what you're thinking:  

203
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,723
     "Why go to Yakyakistan     
      alone, Pinkie Pie?"       

204
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,092
 Because I'm the party planner. 

205
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:31,863
    This burden falls on my     
    rump, and my rump alone.    

206
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,298
    If I want a great party,    

207
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,234
  I gotta climb the mountains   
  North of the Crystal Empire,  

208
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:40,905
   find Yakyakistan, and come   
 back with something authentic. 

209
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,007
       Know what I mean?        

210
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,743
  [crash and screaming brakes]  

211
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,181
    Did we go the wrong way?    

212
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,716
     Where's all the snow?      

213
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,419
     Please tell me this is     
   magical sand-colored snow!   

214
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,791
       Pthew! Nope! Sand.       
        Definitely sand.        

215
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,360
       Dodge City. End of       
     the line, I'm afraid.      

216
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:06,164
 All trains had to stop. Sheep  
 decided to sit on the tracks.  

217
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,766
           [bleating]           

218
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,668
       CURSE YOU, SHEEP!        

219
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,002
Thanks for your help, Conductor.

220
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,142
        Cherry Jubilee!         

221
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,944
     Pinkie Pie? I reckoned     
        I eyeballed you         

222
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,713
   crossin' my way right now.   

223
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:25,050
     How ARE you? You look      
     amazing! I need help!      

224
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:28,186
    I'm dandy as a daffodil     
    and fit as a floribunda.    

225
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,921
     What can I do ya for?      

226
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,423
 Have you heard of Yakyakistan? 

227
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,792
      Do you have ANY idea      
     how I could get there?     

228
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:34,993
   Mark your calender, missy,   

229
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,195
        cause this right        
     here's your lucky day.     

230
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:41,032
I'm headin' north to the Crystal
 Empire myself for a delivery.  

231
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,236
 I oughta warn you, though. Me  
and the boys are powerful tired 

232
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,939
      cause we was up all       
    night countin' cherries.    

233
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,974
      Hey there! Wake up!       

234
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,243
  Counting cherries? How many?  

235
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,978
        Four hundred and        
      seventeen thousand,       

236
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,082
        two hundred and         
     thirty-four. YEE-HAW!      

237
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,149
             Whoa!              

238
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,722
    And so my quest resumes.    

239
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,357
       As I stare across        
      the endless desert,       

240
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,728
   I tell myself I will soon    
triumphantly enter the homeland 

241
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,363
      of our noble guests       
    and return with a prize     

242
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,133
     to make the best party     
       they've ever seen.       

243
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,367
     You know what I mean?      

244
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,003
            Cherry?             

245
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,179
        RAVINE! RAVINE!         

246
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,447
             [ring]             

247
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,915
            [splash]            

248
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:31,916
            WAKE UP!            

249
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,752
            WAKE UP!            

250
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,762
             STOP!              

251
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,800

374
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,633
      Um, no they didn't.       

375
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:32,503
  Trust me, there are a whole   
    lot of sheep out there.     

376
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:40,444
      So, do we walk back       
     up the slide, or what?     

377
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,417
      YAKS STUCK HERE? WHY      
    TRAINS NOT WORK? GRRRR!     

378
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:51,355
    I never thought I'd say     
  this, but THANK YOU, SHEEP!   

379
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,493
    And now, if it's OK with    
     you, it's party time.

       Prince Rutherford,       
      every time we tried       

386
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,748
 to make something in Equestria 
    feel like Yakyakistan,.     

387
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,748
   we couldn't get it right.    

388
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,420
    When I got back from my     
adventure, I realized something.

389
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,323
    We shouldn't try to make    
 Equestria feel like your home. 

390
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,826
   We should try to make you    
   feel at home in Equestria.   

391
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,996
     And that means showing     
    you why we love it here,    

392
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,898
     so you'll love it too.
