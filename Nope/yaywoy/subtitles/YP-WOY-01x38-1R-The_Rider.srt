                 LITTLE FOLKS,  

18
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,988
                YOU SURE DO HAVE
                A TON OF STUFF. 

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,223
      WELL, HOPE YOU LOVE       
     THE NEW PLACE, FOLKS.      

20
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,259
REMEMBER, IT'S NOT JUST         
 A HOUSE, IT'S A HOME.          
        SYLVIA!                 

21
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,127
        WE'RE NOT DONE YET.     

22
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,632
      SO MR. BRITTLE'S          
        READING CHAIR.          

23
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,268
           I'M THINKING         
     THIRD FLOOR STUDY.         

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,335
     ( squeaking )              

25
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,171
  YOU'RE RIGHT.                 

26
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,073
THE EAST BEDROOM                
WOULD GET SOME GOOD SUN         

27
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,208
DURING THE WINTRY MONTHS.       

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,343
    WANDER, IS IT JUST ME,      
 OR HAVE OUR LATEST ADVENTURES  

29
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,345

   ELEMENT OF, YA KNOW...       

30
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,314
           ADVENTURE?           

31
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,589

               YOU NEED, SYLVIA.

32
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,191
               WE'LL BUST INTO  
               HATER'S SHIP...  

33
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:33,725
               YEAH?            

34
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,594

                A BIRTHDAY CAKE!

35
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,062
             BARRY?             

36
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,031

TURNING 30?                     

37
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,366
HASN'T TOLD ANYBODY BUT         
HOPES THEY REMEMBER ANYWAY?     

38
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,135
POOR BARRY.                     

39
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,737
                   ( sighs )    
                   LOOK, I'M ALL
                   FOR HELPING. 

40
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,806
              I COULD JUST USE  
              A LITTLE MORE...  

41
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,975
                   I DON'T KNOW,
                   ACTION.      

42
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,111
       ( loud rumbling )        

43
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,090
              YOU!              

44
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,392
           - YOU.               
           - YOU!               

45
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,761
           SURRENDER NOW, THIEF,

46
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,397
   AND YOUR DEATH WILL BE       
   SLIGHTLY LESS PAINFUL.       

47
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,032
   WAIT. YOU?!                  

48
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,706
 DRAT. THESE WINDOW TREATMENTS  
      ARE JUST ALL ASKEW.       

49
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,079
                    FORTY-TWO.  

50
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,656
      ( raucous coughing )      

51
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,426
         HUH? HUH? HM?          

52
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,195
             HUH?!              

53
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,430
            OH, MAN!            

54
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,671
WELL, YOU AIN'T                 
ANY LIGHTER.                    

55
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,140
  AND THAT SADDLE OF YOURS      
    SURE AIN'T ANY SOFTER.      

56
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,343
    GOOD THING I WAS AROUND     
TO SAVE THAT UGLY MUG OF YOURS. 

57
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,113
 LIKE I'VE EVER NEEDED HELP     
 FROM YOUR CRAGGY OLD HIDE.     

58
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,689
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.         

59
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,691
I THOUGHT YOU WERE              
GONE FOREVER.                   

60
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,993
    TAKES WAY MORE THAN SOME    
    FLAB DRASSIT BLACK HOLE     

61
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,428
        TO TAKE ME DOWN.        

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,930
WHY DIDN'T YOU                  
LET ME KNOW                     

63
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,432
YOU WERE STILL ALIVE,           
YOU NARFIN' FROOD?              

64
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,335

A TEN-FOOT TALL                 
FLARF NARBLER,                  

65
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,437
YOU'RE MIGHTY HARD              
TO TRACK DOWN.                  

66
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,173
               IT IS SO GREAT   
               TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

67
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,175
             ( both laughing )  

68
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,711
                IT IS GREAT     
                TO SEE YOU, TOO.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,416
OH, GROP.                       
WANDER, I'M SO SORRY. I...      

70
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,451

73
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,395
 RYDER.                         

74
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,397
       USED TO RIDE HER.        

75
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,000
      SO YOU REPLACED ME        
   WITH A HAIRY CHICKEN LEG.    

76
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,269
           OH, COME ON,         
     HE'S NOT THAT BAD.         

77
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,337
     LOOK, HE LIKES YOU.        

78
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,472
         ANY OLD FRIEND         
          OF SYLVIA'S           

79
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,808
        IS A NEW FRIEND         
           OF MINE.             

80
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,849
SO WHY WAS HATER                
TRYING TO BLAST                 
YOU INTO ATOMS?                 

81
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,818
          PROBABLY JUST BECAUSE 
          I STOLE THE KEY TO HIS

82
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,453
                HIDDEN GALACTIC 
                STORAGE STATION.

83
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,256
THE PLACE HE KEEPS              
ALL THE LOOT HE'S STOLEN        

84
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,858
THROUGHOUT THE GALAXY?          
I THOUGHT THAT PLACE            
WAS A MYTH.                     

85
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,193
           IT'S REAL, ALL RIGHT.

86
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,995
         NOW THAT I GOT THE KEY,

87
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,264
               I JUST GOTTA FIND
               THE LOCATION OF  
               THE DARN THING.  

88
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,966
OH, MAN, SOUNDS LIKE            
A REAL ADVENTURE.               

89
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,968

    THE ROUGHEST, TOUGHEST,     

90
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,370

          I EVER HAD.           

91
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,305
          YOU MAY JUST          
         COME IN HANDY.         

92
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,340

         A RIP-ROARING,         

93
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,843
         ACTION-PACKED,         
    TRANS-GALACTIC ADVENTURE    

94
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,145
     TO BREAK INTO HATER'S      
     HIDDEN STORAGE STATION     

95
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,147
       TO STEAL THE MOST        
      PRICELESS TREASURES       

96
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,316
    IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE?     

97
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,151
RIP-ROARING?                    
TOP SECRET?                     

98
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,487

COUNT ME IN!

100
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,458
         I DON'T KNOW.          

101
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,827
       BREAK INTO? STEAL?       

102
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,863
                    SOUNDS A BIT
                    DISHONEST,  

103
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,164
                DON'T YOU THINK?

104
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,366
OH, YEAH.                       
SORRY, RYDER.                   

105
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,269
SINCE YOU AND I SPLIT,          
WANDER AND I HAVE BEEN          

106
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,405
FOCUSED ON HELPING OTHERS       
AND DOING GOOD.

        TAX-DEDUCTIBLE.         

145
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,690
     WANDER, WHY DON'T YOU

      THAT'S GREAT, BUDDY.      

151
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,542
       IN FACT, THEY SAY        
   THEY'RE FRIENDS OF YOURS.    

152
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,077
  THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU  
    TO SHOW UP WITH THAT KEY

159
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,428
   RYDER, YOU DOUBLE-CROSSED    
       THE SCUZZ BUCKETS

161
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,270
NINETY-EIGHT.                   

162
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,606
         YOU FLAB DRASSIT GLORF.

163
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,582
    THAT SURE IS A FUNNY WAY    
     TO GREET OLD FRIENDS.      

164
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,495
      AIN'T FORGOT HOW TO       
 HOT-WIRE A CRUISER, HAVE YOU?  

165

           REMEMBER?            

166

                  BRING IT BACK.
                  I PROMISE.

00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,546
   SPREAD OUT.

        WITH A BLASTER,         
         FLAB DRASSIT.          

170
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,689

ONE OF THESE, RIGHT?            

171
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:51,263
                  ZAP, ZAP.     
                  ZAP, ZAP, ZAP!
                  ZAP-ZAP, ZAP!

00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,398
             I'M SORRY. IS IT   
             MORE OF A "PEW-PEW"

173
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,367
                     OR A "BZZ"?

174
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,403
      ON THREE, WE POP UP       
        AND RETURN FIRE         

175
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,672
                REAL FIRE, OKAY?

176
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,374

       EXCUSE ME, OPPONENTS.

               RETURNING FIRE.  

179
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,446
        I SUGGEST DUCKING       
        TO AVOID SERIOUS INJURY.

180
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,283

WE'RE TRYING TO INJURE THEM.    

182
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,589
                  WHY WOULD WE

          ALONG WITH            
     A FRESH FRUIT BASKET.      

186
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,749
     DO YOU PREFER HONEYDEW     
       OR BINGLEBERRIES?

194
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,575
MAYBE YOU SHOULD                
JUST LEAVE THIS                 
TO THE PROFESSIONALS.           

195
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,450
     UH-OH. WE GOT COMPANY.     

196
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,219
        ( evil laughter)        

197
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,722
                  GRAB THE WHEEL
                  SO I CAN BLAST
                  THESE BOZOS.  

198

       TALKING TO RYDER.        

200
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,662
I THOUGHT THAT                  
WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS.             

201
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,831
             IS THERE ANYTHING  
             I CAN DO TO HELP?  

202
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,600
   YES, TOTALLY. JUST, UM...    
     DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.      

203
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,373
       Ryder: SURE HOPE         
      YOUR AIM'S IMPROVED       

204

     JUST TRY AND KEEP UP.      
          ( laughs )            

206
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,880
QUICK UPDATE: HAVE NOT          
PUT MY HANDS ON ANYTHING.       

207
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,484
THE ENTIRE SHIP REMAINS         
REMARKABLY UNTOUCHED.           

208
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:16,307

 TOWARD A WHOLE MESS OF STUFF.  

209
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,310
   Ryder: I KNOW. WE'RE GONNA   
    CRASH RIGHT THROUGH IT.     

210
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,514
AND USE THE DISTRACTION TO BLAST
   THE LAST OF THESE LOSERS.    

211
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,315
             NICE.              

212
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,651

322
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,330
    BUT NOBODY CARES.           

323
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,068
    SYLVIA!                     

324
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,338
    WANDER? WHAT, HOW, WHO?     

325
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,675
       REMEMBER THAT TIME       
          ON KEE-TON 6          

326
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,210
         WHEN WE HELPED         
        THE IMMENSAPEDE         

327
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,745
        FIND HIS MISSING        
         CONTACT LENS?          

328
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,714
          TURNS OUT,            
      THIS IS HIS COUSIN.       

329
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,851
OH, SYLVIA,                     

330
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,621
I KNOW YOU AND RYDER            
ARE ALL TOUGH AND COOL,         

331
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,124
AND I'M OFTEN NOT,              
BUT...                          

332
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,326
                ARE YOU KIDDING?

333
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,261
         YOU REMEMBER THE TIME  
         YOU BUSTED INTO HATER'S
         SECRET STORAGE UNIT    

334
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,698
     ON A GIANT SPACE WORM      
       JUST TO HELP YOUR        
          BEST FRIEND?          

335
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,668
           THAT WAS PRETTY COOL.

336
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,939
WOULD YOU SAY                   
US BEING FRIENDS                

337
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,741
IS THE GREATEST                 
ADVENTURE OF ALL?               

338
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,711
     NO, BECAUSE THAT WOULD     
       BE WAY TOO SAPPY.        

339
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,348
                   BUT I'M KINDA
                   THINKIN' IT. 

340
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,987
   FREDERICK, THANKS SO MUCH    
        FOR THE ADVICE.         

341
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,123
       IT TOTALLY WORKED.       

342
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,991
    WHY, THAT'S SPECTACULAR,    
            WANDER.             

343
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,360
    REMEMBER, ACKNOWLEDGING     
       YOUR DIFFERENCES         

344
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,929
        CAN OFTEN MAKE          
  A RELATIONSHIP EVEN RICHER.   

345
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,364
 ( roaring )                    

346
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,633
YOU KNOW, HE WAS                
GONNA EAT ME.                   

347
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,768
 WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?         

348
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,638
OH, WANDER.                     

349
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,739
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?         

350
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,474
           SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

351
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,743
        BUT I WAS ASKING        
          A SPACE WORM          
      ABOUT FRIENDSHIP...       

352
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:06,744
         I DON'T CARE.          

353

356
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,788

357
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,993
           ( gasps )            
            BARRY!

362

       STUFF SECRET, MAN.       

363
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,412
           STOP THEM!           

364
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,948
      YOU'RE EMBARRASSING       
    BOTH ME AND YOURSELVES.     

365
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,252
DREADFULLY SORRY,               
BUT I THINK I KNOCKED OVER

        ONE MORE THING.

     YOUR SHIP UNDAMAGED."      

378
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,491
