     THE WEDDING ENTIRELY,      

61
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,387

          THAT'S TWO GOOD DEEDS 
                      GONE BAD. 

73
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,316
       I HATE TO SAY IT, BUDDY, 
   BUT WE'RE HAVING AN OFF DAY. 

74
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,218
     NO!                        

75
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,752
 GOOD NEVER HAS AN OFF DAY!     

76

 WE CAN STILL RIGHT THIS WRONG.

      SIR, I AM SO SORRY        

78
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,464
        WE CAUSED YOUR          
      TRUE LOVE TO LEAVE.       

79
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,967
    OH, SHE WASN'T MY TRUE LOVE.

80
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,069

  NO, I WAS JUST MARRYING HER   

82
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,273
       TO STOP THE FEUD         
     BETWEEN OUR FAMILIES.      

83
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,808
     WHICH I GUESS NOW...       

84
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,910
     IS BACK ON!

BIT OF A CHALLENGE,             

89
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:21,093
BUT I BELIEVE WE                
CAN END UP RIGHT!               

90
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,195

         FIRE!

00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,787
I DON'T KNOW HOW,               

160
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,358
BUT I AM PRETTY SURE            
THAT IS OUR FAULT.              

161
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,561
    SO WHAT? WE'VE RIGHTED      
     THESE WRONGS ALL DAY.      

162
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,263
   SO WHAT'S STOPPING US NOW?   

163
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,066
 SYLVIA, I'VE BEEN THINKING...  

164
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:59,137
         MAYBE, UM...           
     WE SHOULDN'T STOP IT.      

165
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,207
      ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR       
     FLIP-PICKIN' LUPSORK?      

166
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,476
 BUT IF SOMETHING WORSE HAPPENS?

167
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,712
I ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU  
   START ON THE RIGHT PATH,     

168
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,515
       YOU ALWAYS END UP        
      IN THE RIGHT PLACE,       

169
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,449
      BUT...                    

170
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,152
    EVERY TIME WE TRY TO DO GOOD

171
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,655
      IT JUST TURNS INTO        
       SOMETHING WORSE,         

172
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:20,792
       AND WORSE, AND WORSE.    

173
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:26,398
IF WE STOP THAT MISSILE IT COULD
 CAUSE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE TO... 

174
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,667
 ( garbled )

      WE'VE BEEN HAVING,        

176
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,371
      THAT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.

177
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,441
      BUT I'M ALSO SAYING       
   THAT IF DOING A GOOD DEED    

178
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,511
     LEADS TO THE UNIVERSE      
     GETTING DESTROYED...       

179
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:43,315

   I WANT TO LIVE IN ANYWAY.    

180
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,793
                YA YA YA!
