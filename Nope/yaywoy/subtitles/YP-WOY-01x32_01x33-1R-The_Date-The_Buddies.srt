       I blast my quads, delts, 
              and quadriplexis.

         ( whistling )          

110
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,335
      Fine!                     

111
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,303
     Whatever it takes          
for this dinner to be over.     

112
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,839
                           Yup. 
                 Dinner's over. 

113
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,342
       Now we can get on        
  with the rest of the date.    

114
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,943
           Rest of...

116
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,584
         Step right up.         

117
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,953
      Everyone's a winner       
   when love is in the air.     

118
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,292
                  Two, please.  
          Hatey's first.

That was a night to remember.   

136
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:02,387
               No matter        
       how hard I try to forget.

137
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,325
             You know,          
Lynn, of all the many,          

138
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,328
    many women                  
I've totally dated,             

139
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,497
 you're the most                
easily impressed.               

140
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,499
    I like that.                

141
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,220
           ( crying )           

142
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,058
        Uh, Lord Hater.         
I'm not crying!                 
You're crying!                  

143
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,395
     I try so hard,             
          you know.             

144
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:45,330
   But I have a big personality.

145
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,266
    Gah, I'm such an idiot.     
 You're so cool and I just...   

146
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,169
 want a girl to like me.        

147
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,243
                ( groans )

00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:10,055
     ( exclaiming loudly )      

149
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,163
You know what?                  
I don't even want to blow up    
this stupid planet anymore.     

150
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,401
         Well, thanks           
   for the memorable night.     

151
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,003
   We'll do this again.         

152
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,473
     How about every night      
for the rest of our lives?      

153
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,245
               Oh, no.          

154
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,114
   Lynn, say yes.               

155
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,518
    The thought of spending     
  even one second without you   

156
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,552
           makes me             
        want to blow up         

157
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,554
        all the planets         
       in the universe!         

158
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,424
        What do you say?        

159
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,426
          ( gulping )           

160
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:51,162
       ( siren blaring )        

161
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,464
          No pressure.          

162
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,540
    ( playing rock version      
  of "Here Comes The Bride" )   

163
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,451
  I always cry at these things. 

164
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,321
It's just dinner and a carnival 
   and a lifetime of misery.    

165
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,089
       It's just dinner         
        and a carnival          
   and a lifetime of misery.    

166
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,691
It's just dinner and a carnival 
   and a lifetime of misery.    

167
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,493
       It's just dinner         
        and a carnival          
   and a lifetime of misery.    

168
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,628
It's just dinner and a carnival 
   and a lifetime of misery.    

169
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,564
             Oops!              
         Stupid heels.          

170
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,244
        Dearly beloved,         
     we are gathered today      

171
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,380
    to marry this stunning      
    vision of loveliness...     

172
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,382
         to some broad          
    he met at a restaurant.     

173
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,486
If anyone objects               
to the marriage of Lord Hater   
and Linguini Von Breadstick,    

174
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,387
 let them speak now or...       

175
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,556
                           Stop!

176
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,494
           I object.            

177
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,496
   I do declare, Lord Hater,    

178
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,565
   I am your number one fan.    

179
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,502
             I've pined for you 
            from afar for ages, 

180
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,504
               always too afraid
                 to approach.   

181
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,505
                        Oh!     

182
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,807
     But now that I see you     

183
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,142
          in the arms           
     of this cheap horse,       

184
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,478
    no offense, I must say      
    fiddle dee dee to that      

185
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,380
    and say my piece.           

186
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,683
    Take me instead.            

187
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,353
       I got you into this mess,
        I'm gonna get you out.  

188
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,254
  By putting yourself           
       into the mess?           

189
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,389
        It's not a perfect plan.

190
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,392
           Ooh, hey.            
           Awkward.             

191
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:30,261
    Ladies, there's no need     
       to fight over me.        

192
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,664
 When you're the most dynamic   
   overlord in the universe,    

193
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,200
        women are gonna         
throw themselves at your feet.  

194
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,501
I'm Lord Hater.                 

195
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:40,505
          Why should I settle   
       for a "six" and a "four" 

196
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,407
         when there's           
   a whole galaxy of "tens"     

197
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,510
       seeking the Lord         
       Dater experience?        

198
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,346
                Listen,         
 I've had a swell time,         

199
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,348
          but I forgot          
      about this thing          

200
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,550
           I've got             
    somewhere else.             

201
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,252
You've been awesome.            
      Keep in touch.            

202
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,394
                          Phew! 
     Planet L'Amouria is saved, 

203
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,430
       Hater's regained         
       his confidence...        
And we're both still single.    

204
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,767
 I better have been the "six,"  

205
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,602
         or I'm gonna go        
back there and deck him.        

206
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,773
      Whoo!                     
  Free man!                     

207
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,776
                Peepers,        
set a course for ladies.        

208
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,478
      Whoever we find has       
got to be better than those two.

209
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,781
             You mean Sylvia    
         and Wander in dresses? 

210
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:23,848
   What?                        

211
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,453
      This is it, Wander!       

212
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,322
  This is where our wretched    
     rivalry finally ends.      

213
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,892
     Peepers!                   

214
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,461
 Activate the portal to the pit 
       of perpetual pain.       

215
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,463
       ( evil laugh )           

216
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,699
             Ooh,               
            pretty!             

217
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,400
            It's not pretty!    

218
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,868
         It's a portal          
    to the prison dimension     

219
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,471
     where I have banished      
   my most despised enemies!    

220
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,473
   Say good-bye, Wander.

                      Know him? 
          He helped me start up 
             my used bookstore. 

255
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:45,490
 He taught me                   
how to whistle.                 

256
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,426
     He helped me deal          
with my violent tendencies.     

257
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,795

       a small business owner...

260
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:58,436
        until somebody          
    destroyed my bookstore,     

261
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:02,507
    all because I told him      
his novel wasn't selling well.  

262
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,510
      So he threw me in here!

          ( growling )          

264
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,718
      Stop! I can't have        
      some of my friends        
   hurting my other friends.
