100
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,683
                  why not drive 
       this doohickey together? 

101
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:20,452
Now is not the time             
to teach these selfish jerks    
about teamwork.                 

102
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:23,155
It's time to save

107
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,215
                Sure seems like 
           we could use a hand. 

108
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,851
            And by hand, I mean 
                 a metaphorical 
                  helping hand. 

109
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,020
                      But also, 
                a literal hand.

                 Yep, a helpful 
              hand-helping hand 

111
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,391
                     sure would 
                  come in handy 
                     right now. 

112
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,860
I get it. The hand.             
And no, they can't.             
I got this.                     

113
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,931
  ( Sylvia running upstairs,    
   panting and muttering )      

114
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,940
     ( footsteps running )      

115
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,772
          ( sighing )           

116
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,107
          ( humming )           

117
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,109
        Where are they?         

118
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,581
     Finally. Let's do--        
        Oh, it's you.           

119
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,916
       Situation report.        

120
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,852
    Robomechabotatron has       
       not yet arrived.         

121
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,554
         Oh, really?            
     What tipped you off?       

122
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,356
     The complete lack of       
   awesome robot fighting?!     

123
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,025
    Get outta my mech face.     

124
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,028
        What is taking          
     those dorks so long?       

125
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,797
          ( panting )           

126
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,032
 Maybe if you hold one foot...  

127
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,734
            Wander?             

128
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,068
 Wander?                        

129
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,938
                <i> Mi roboto</i>      
                <i> es su roboto.</i>  

130
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,873
        Whoa! Wander,           
        are you nuts?           

131
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,575
   You can't trust these two.   

132
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,545
 It's my Robomccrackalackadon!  

133
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,313
       You're not even          
       saying it right!         

134
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,116
             Stop!!             

135
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,088
          ( sighs )             
        Come on, guys.          
     Robomechabotatron...       

136
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,924
   That's not how you say it.   

137
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,493
    ...was created to save      
   the galaxy from threats      

138
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,295
   no one planet could face.    

139
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,797
     The galaxy is bigger       
     than any one of us,        

140
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,333
         and it needs           
    all of us to save it.       

141
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,435
       In the spirit of         
      this mighty mech,         

142
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,804
   should we not put aside      
    our petty differences       

143
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,007
       to work together         
    and save the galaxy?!       

144
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,009
         If we have to.         

145
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,212
           - Fine.              
          - Whatevs.            

146
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,082
       Seems like we're         
      becomin' friends!         

147
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,984
     ALL: Battle stations!      

148
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,008
             Hey, it's actually 
                       working. 

149
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,512
That's because                  
there is no "I"                 
in Robomechabotatron.           

150
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,180
 I think.                       

151
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,449
    Door-opening sequence,      
          activate.             

152
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,484
        - Go, Robo...           
          - Mecha...            

153
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,186
          - Bota...             
           - Tron.              

154
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,254
            ALL: Go!            

155
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,129
      - ALL: Dominator?         
     - WANDER: Dominator!       

156
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,365
       I'm done waiting.        

157
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,500
   Mama wants a robo battle,    

158
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,302
     and Mama wants it now!     

159
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,574
          - Bring...            
           - It...              
            - On!               

160
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:05,176
       Whoa, whoa, whoa!        

161
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,145
 I didn't know we were gonna    
be fighting with this dudette.  

162
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,549
            What else do you do 
           with a super-charged 
                   attack suit? 

163
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,517
    This who-sama-whats-is      
        could be doing          

164
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,986
      so much more good         
          than harm.            

165
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,155
        Fixing roads,           
    transporting supplies,      

166
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,758
     giving out giant hugs.     

167
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,726
I knew it.                      
Every time!                     

168
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,096
       Um, any day now!         
     SYLVIA: One second.        

169
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,165
           Look, you're the one 
                  who wanted us 
                    to team up. 

170
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,067
                  Are you gonna 
             join us in this... 

171
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,702
   Sure to be totally ugly...   

172
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,337
Robot fight                     
or not?                         

173
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,940
          ( sighs )             
        If that's what          
       the group wants,         

174
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,708
    I won't try to stop you.    

175
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,443
                     The galaxy 
             thanks you, buddy. 

176
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,079
     Activate battle mode!      

177
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,254
            Finally!            

178
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,192
        - Go, Robo...           
          - Mecha...            
          - Bota...             

179
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,094
      HATER: What the...        
          Why did...            

180
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:00,098
  I wanna use my laser axe!     
         ( sobbing )            

181
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,866
Wander, what's going on         
down there?                     

182
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,302
         Sorry. I won't stop ya,

183
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,538
          but I gotta stand for 
             what I believe in. 

184
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,306
      Hey, we doin' this        
           or what?             

185
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,175
          Forget it.            
      We don't need him.        

186
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,481
      Feel the might of         
    Robomochasaskatchewan!      

187
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,951
      No, no, no, no, no!       

188
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,325
        ( screaming )           
    Activate escape mode!       

189
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,573
   DOMINATOR: But my giant      
         robo fight.            

190
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,675
          ( sighs )             
        You know what?          

191
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,077
   Fine. I can still roast      
     those dumb Cluckons        

192
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,979
        with this thing.        

193
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,514
               In your absence, 
               the Cluckons had 
       enough time to evacuate. 

194
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:53,151
         The chickens           
     have flown the coop.       

195
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,853
( shrieking )                   
Forget it.                      

196
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,155
        You guys are the worst, 
            and I hate you all. 

197
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,160
     Would ya look at that?     

198
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,030
    Even without a fight,       
  we still rescued Cluckon.     

199
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,332
    See. Working together       
        saved the day.          

200
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,534
All in favor of never           
working together again...       

201
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,269
           PEEPERS              
       AND SYLVIA: Aye!         

202
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,438
       Seems like we're         
      becoming friends.         

203
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,149
( yells )                       
Flab drassin' Dominator...      

204
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:28,887
won't fold right...             
grop darn map destroyin'        
the entire galaxy!! Gaaaaaaa!   

205
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,191
          ( sighs )             
    She can't be stopped.       

206
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,793
      She's too powerful.       

207
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,395
        There's no hope.        

208
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,401
           Uh, hello?           

209
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,336
She can't be stopped.           

210
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,439
Too powerful,                   
no hope. Oh, no!                

211
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,642
Put that thing                  
back in there.                  

212
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,011
I'm supposed to be              
the worried one.                

213
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,213
If you give up,                 
then we really are saying       

214
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,749
nope to hope, and I just        
can't cope with that,           

215
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,751
so suck that back up,           
mister.                         

216
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,887
          Oh!                   

217
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,491
Gotta find some hope,           
gotta find some hope.           

218
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,226
 Ha. There.                     

219
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,429
See. If that flower             
can blossom amidst              
the chaos,                      

220
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,898
then there                      
really is hope.                 

221
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,242
No, no, no, no!                 

222
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,444
Dominator might destroy         
every planet from here          
to eternity,                    

223
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,012
but she will not                
destroy this.                   

224
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,781
We're gonna do                  
everything we can               

225
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,449
to save                         
this flower.                    

226
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,088
     Okay, before we begin,     

227
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,090
we need to deduce what species  
   this flower belongs to.      

228
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,192
      That will allow us        
    to accurately pinpoint      

229
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,194
      its specific needs        
       while we conduct         

230
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,864
 a full seismological study,    
  and then we can go forward    

231
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,866
  and find out what exactly     
        the needs are           

232
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,101
    to reproduce the flower.    

233
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,437
No need to                      
overthink this.                 
Plants need water.              

234
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,373
                  Stop!         

235
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,709
     You can't just dump        
   water on it willy-nilly.     

236
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,478
    Too much and you risk       
  drowning the root system.     

237
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,148
   Too little and it won't      
  get the nutrients it needs    
        from the soil.          

238
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,416
 I'll be careful.               

239
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,918
                   Okay, that's 
                   too careful. 

240
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,653
           What, are you crazy?!

241
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,455
               Just a little... 
                      too much! 

242
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,390
                   Little more. 
                     Agh! More! 

243
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,392
                 A little less. 
                     Less more! 

244
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,574
Hey, you know what?             

245
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,410
 - Plants also need sunlight.   
          - No sun.             

246
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,814
          No problem.           

247
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,383
      Let there be light!       

248
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,100
          Plant food.           

249
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,335
Plants gotta                    
eat, right?                     

250
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,504
                     Hey, yeah. 
          I just happen to have 

251
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,240
            a pint-size potluck 
                perfect for our 
                puckered plant. 

252
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,353
                        Oh, no. 
               Plant food coma! 

253
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,140
   You know we're trying to     
save your stamen here, right?   

254
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,244
     Music. I hear plants       
   love the good vibrations     

255
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,212
      of a positive ditty.      

256
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,984

00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,609
        No. I really appreciate 
               the effort, Syl. 

268
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,245
             I don't mean to be 
           so teary and dreary. 

269
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,614
          I just have to accept 
      that nothing in the world 

270
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,283
         can save little Planty.

271
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,251
 Nothing on this world.         

272
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,532
      This place is great!      

273
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,523
       ( both shrieking )       

274
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,411
          - Wander.             
         - Quicksand!           
    Nature's devious trap.      

275
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,515
( screaming )                   

276
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,860
A greenhouse.                   

277
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,662
A controlled environment,       
a friendly caretaker.           

278
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,697
           This is for the best.

279
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,505
              Why is it so hard 
                to find a place 

280
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,307
     with a mild climate,       
    slightly acidic soil,       

281
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,677
                 and absolutely 
      no grop darn giant bees?! 

282
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,846
                   ( sighs )    

283
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,682
Mild climate,                   
slightly acidic soil,           

284
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,218
free of giant bees.             

285
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,819
    Gentle breezes out of       
        the northeast.          

286
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,789
          That'd be             
    the icing on the cake,      

287
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,226
     but it's okay, Syl.        
        I'll be fine.           

288
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,896
          I just have to accept 
  that Planty's a doomed bloom. 

289
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:15,199
         An ephemeral perennial.

290
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,802
        A sprout that           
        must drop out.          

291
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,873
                    A plant who 
                  simply can't. 

292
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,145
          This place            
         is perfect!            

293
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,350
                      We did it!

294
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,552
            We saved the flower!

295
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,721
Maybe there's hope              
after all.                      

296
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,758
      Aw, that's so sweet.      

297
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,161
        ( evil giggle )         

298
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:47,732
                 Planet K-129CX 
       is ready for domination. 

299
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,767
        Change of plans.        

300
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:53,504
 Set destination coordinates    
 for some soul-crushin' fun.    

301
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,543
No, no, no.                     
Is it a giant bee?              

302
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,111
           Just the biggest bee 
                 in the galaxy. 

303
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,746
           Dominator!           

304
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,415
         ( sniffling            
        and whining )           

305
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,517
      Dominator, you can        
       destroy planets,         

306
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,186
       you can destroy          
        the galaxy...           

307
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,088
        But as long as          
       we're standing,          

308
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,789
         you'll never           
     destroy this flower.       

309
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,592
     Wow. I had no idea...      

310
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,628
       what hokey saps          
          you were.             

311
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,764
       Blah blah blah.          
 "As long as I'm standing..."   

312
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,266
     I can't believe you        
 actually said that out loud.   

313
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,169
   For that, I'm taking you     
          all down.             

314
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,509
          ( laughing )          

315
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,021
          ( laughing )          

316
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,140
     ( laughter continues )     

317
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,655
                  Give it.      

318
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,759
         Give it back!          

319
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,762
             You know, when you 
               utterly demolish 
           planet after planet, 

320
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,131
        it's easy to lose sight 
           of the little things 

321
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,534
              that you are also 
    demolishing in the process. 

322
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,702
                A bird singing, 
            this stupid flower. 

323
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,472
  Any hope of your survival     
     all crumbling within       

324
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,340
     my cold, fiery grasp.      

325
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,042
   Gotta love what you do,      
         am I right?            

326
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,844
                Oh, wow.        

327
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,446
      This is seriously         
 really sad for both of you.    

328
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,781
                    Hold up.    

329
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,120
          All right, enough fun.

330
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,689
        Say good-bye,           
   Wander and, the Zbornak.     

331
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,891
             I wanna say Sybil. 
                 Ah, who cares? 

332
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,126
      You're both doomed.       

333
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,864
         - Ah-choo!             
        <i> - Gesundheit.</i>          

334
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,166
         - Ah-choo.             
    <i> - Gesundheit </i> again.       

335
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,970
     ( sneezing continues )     

336
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,475
      Get them... ah-choo!      

337
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,744
             Did not compute.   

338
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,747
This--choo isn't--choo          
over--choo!                     

339
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,849
       I'll get--ah-choo!       

340
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,151
     ( sneezing continues )     

341
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,686
      ( Sylvia laughing )       

342
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,854
  Dominator isn't unstoppable.  

343
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,723
      She can be defeated.      

344
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,858
 Sure, hay fever really isn't   
 an effective long-term plan    

345
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,260
        for thwarting           
   a maniacal evil villain,     

346
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,861
      but it's something.       

347
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,531
         See, Wander,           
     there's always hope.       

348
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,932
               ( crying )       

349
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,834
       No. It's too late.       

350
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,237
         SYLVIA: Noooo!         

351
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,572
   I can... bring it... back.   

352
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,873
            Sylvia.             

353
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,209
I think I feel a pulse.         

354
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,478
          - Sylvia.             
 - I won't fail you, Wander.    

355
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,483
              No!               

356
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,360
              Sylvia, you tried 
                   your hardest 

357
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,295
            to save this flower.

358
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,298
And it decided                  
to return the favor             
by saving us.                   

359
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,867
It's not bad                    
to be sad.                      

360
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,903
   But I can't have you sad     
  or everything's hopeless.     

361
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,805
      Just because I'm sad      

362
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,774
         doesn't mean           
     I've given up hope.        

363
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,843
        - You haven't?          
           - Nope.              

364
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,959
      Wander, I promise,        
     we'll stop Dominator       

365
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,161
  and we'll figure out a way    
   to restore this galaxy.      

366
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,796
                 Ya think?      

367
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,031
  I sure hope so.               

368
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,746
 - ( sneezing continuously )    
           - Bots!              

369
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:56,814
       Ah-choo! After...        

370
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,916
   Ah-choo... will you get...   

371
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,418
            Ah-choo!            

372
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,254
          ( groaning )          

373
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,923
     ( blows nose loudly )
