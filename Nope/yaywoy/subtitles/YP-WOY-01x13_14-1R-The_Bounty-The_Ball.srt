    It's a stunt                
     spectacular!               

120
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,500
             Not on my watch,   
           you bucket of bolts! 

121
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,413
      I feel like I'm on        
    a real, live spaceship!     

122

                   This is      
             the best ride ever!

123
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,985
You guys really pulled out      
            all the stops.      

124
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,388
                  Unbelievable! 
                  Unbelievable!

   In your face, Lord Hater!    

133
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,146
      That's what happens       
         when you send          

134
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,049
      a pig and a machine       
    to do an eyeball's job.     

135
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,422
    And now you two are mine    

136
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,125
      for the excessively       
       forceful taking.         

137
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,594
   Evil will conquer the galaxy.

138

       All because of me!

00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,352
        This is                 
the grossest ride ever.         

143
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,355
                    Aw, man.

Commander Peepers.              

145
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,359
I didn't know you worked        
     on Planet Phunulon.        

146
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,795
See? I knew your weren't        
such a bad guy after all.       

147
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,397
                      Wander,   
                   it's a trap. 

148
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,365
          We're going to be     
     turned over to Lord Hater. 

149
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,700
          Really?               
             Wow.               

150
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,802
Well then I must say            
    congratulations,            

151
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,804
you finally caught us,          
  Commander Peepers.            

152
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,639
   Most of your attempts        
to try and catch us are,        

153
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,075
please excuse my language,      
              kinda stinky,     

154
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,210
but this plant thing            
    is just amazing.            

155
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,779
It totally took us              
      by surprise,              

156
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,714
    we had no idea              
you were after us.              

157
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,083
       And even though          
we're sad to be caught          

158
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,518
 I am just so happy             

159
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,421
  thinking about how proud      
Lord Hater will be of you.      

160
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,740

161
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,518
       Well, even though        
   I am a miserable failure     

162
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
    and that bounty hunter      
      got all the glory,        

163
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,423
 Lord Hater finally conquered   
     the entire universe,       

164
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,725
     and that...                

165
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,360
     (sniff)                    

166
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,195
     that's good enough for me.

00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,923
       The winds already?       

230
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,625
    This doomsday is moving     
     along quite briskly.       

231
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,396
     BOTH: Huh?                 

232
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,767
 You folks are abandoning your  
 beautiful home for a new one?  

233
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,968
 Just like that?                

234
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,471
         What?                  
Of course not.                  

235
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,707
   There aren't any planets     
      left in our system.       

236
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,543
  We have absolutely no idea    
      where we're going.        

237
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,813
We'll just fly through space    
   until we run out of fuel.    

238
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,115
           Or food,             
    whichever comes first.      

239
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,984
           How does             
   one fight off cannibals?     

240
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,587
  Some kind of pointy stick,    
           I assume.            

241
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,825
          Everyone just hold up!

242
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,562
  Y'all have put so much work   
into this pretty little planet. 

243
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,431
        Don't you want          
      to try and save it?       

244
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,433
            I know              
   you're scared of Buster.     

245
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,834
   But if you keep running,     

246
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,103
       that's all you're        
     ever gonna be doing.       

247
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,672
       You have a chance        
        to change that.         

248
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:38,109
     You just have to turn      
and face your problems head on. 

249
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,612
What do you say?                

250
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,618
Eh, sure. Whatever.             

251
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,453
That's good enough for me.      

252
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:49,554
Now gather round.               

253
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,922
I have a plan.                  

254
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,690
We got his attention.           

255
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,558
Time for phase two.             

256
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,974
We did it!                      

257
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,643
       Here's to facing         
    your problems head on.      

258
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,779
    Huh. Hey, not bad.          

259
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,614
What do you know?               

260
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,516
  I did not think               
 I was gonna win.               

261
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,686
    Uh... folks...              

262
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,454
            (gasps)             

263
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,603
              What happened?!   
           I thought it worked! 

264
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,639
Flarf nabbit,                   
it     <i>di</i>work.                  

265
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,976
We threw a dog a bone           
 and he fetched it.             

266
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,780
    Oh, darn.                   

267
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,515
  The Sticky Rains              
        of Terror?              

268
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,584
        We've lingered          
         far too long.          

269
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,186
  Come on.                      
Time to flee.                   

270
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,999
Wander, buddy,                  
     we tried,                  

271
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,568
   but these folks seem okay    
with just getting out of here.  

272
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,836
Maybe we should be too?         

273
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,504
               Naw-uh.          
               No way.          

274
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,072
           I have one more plan.

275
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,274
           Everybody!           

276
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,143
         One more plan!         

277
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,778
         One more plan!         

278
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,081
        One more plan!          
        One more plan!          

279
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:00,985
        All right, soldiers.    

280
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,288
        On my mark... present...

281
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,289
        weapons!                

282
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,527
          Wet...                
      whistle.                  

283
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,631
         Deep breaths.          

284
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,170
          And blow!!!           

285
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,740
          ( silence )           

286
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,582
      It's working!             

287
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,918
    Don't stop now!             

288
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,630
        (Buster barking)        

289
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,667
            ALL: Ah!            

290
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,039
    Hey, bad dog! Ah-ah-ah!     

291
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,681
        Wait. New plan.         

292
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,782
           Everybody!           

293
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,284
        Wait. New plan.         
           New plan.            

294
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,618
           New much better plan.

295
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,621
           Everyone.            
  All new and improved plan.    

296
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,058
  Trash.                        

297
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,294
  Everybody.                    

298
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,995
        Hit that tongue         
      with the grossest,        

299
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,998
    nastiest, worst-tasting     
     garbage you can find.      

300
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,288
       Wha--                    
Why didn't it work?             

301
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,124
                    Wander,     
               don't you get it?

302
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,693
               Dogs love trash. 

303
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,370
               But, but--       

304
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,739
    Sorry buddy,                
it's time to go.                

305
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,407
But, but--                      

306
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,219
Hey, you guys made it.          
         That's great.          

307
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,420
         Go, go, go, go, go!    

308
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,001
        So we didn't            
get a win this time.            

309
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,402
     But Wander,                

310
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,805
sometimes a problem is so big,  
    you just have to flee.      

311
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,343
              No!               

312
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,445
      There's only one way      
 to stop this once and for all! 

313
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,253
                   Ah!          

314
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,721
           Come on,             
         what are you-          

315
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,732
       What's going on?         
        Where's Wander?         

316
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,035
 That little kamikaze's heading 
   straight for that monster!   

317
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,469
            Wander.             

318
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,939
         I know you're upset    
     that Buster ate the planet.

319
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,373
             Heck, so are       
       the rest of these folks. 

320
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,075
    Eh, we'll get over it.      

321
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,945
       But destroying him and us
          is not the answer.    

322
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,413
        We have to flee!        

323
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,216
 That's what I'm doing!         

324
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,750
   I'm facing this problem...   

325
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,419
           head on!!!           

326
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,105
            Head on.            

327
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,139
             Yeah.              

328
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,874
         Have you lost your nut?

329
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,910
               Do you realize   
             what you just did? 

330
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,312
 Without that ship, these folks 
      have nowhere to live.     

331
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,514
             They needed        
     some place safe from Buster

332
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,317
                    with trees  
                   and fresh air

333
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,387
               and places       
         for really great spas. 

334
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,321
                          And...

335
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,491
               And...           
                 Huh.           

336
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,863
          Oh, Wander.           

337
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,499
   Thanks to you, we finally    
    have a permanent home.      

338
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,505
       Yeah. See, y'all         
always wanted to flee.          

339
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,842
       But it turns out,        
all you really needed to do...  

340
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,410
     was  <i>flea.</i>                 

341
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,481
                       F-L-E-A. 
                         Flea.  

342
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,182
              You know, bzzt--  
                 like the bug?
