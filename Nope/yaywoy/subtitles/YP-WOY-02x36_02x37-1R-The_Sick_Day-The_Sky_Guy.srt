13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,976
        Okay, Wander,           
           I'm up.              

14
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,844
      You don't have to...      

15
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,546
       Since when am I          
      the first one up?         

16
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,383
     Good morning, Sylvia.      

17
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,619
     What a beautiful day.      

18
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,823
     Uh, you feeling okay       
        there, buddy?           

19
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:59,591
             Okay?              

20
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,660
       I'm feeling great.       

21
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,763
    How's about a rousing       
     "good morning" song        

22
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,099
       to get this day          
        started right?          

23
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:11,737
    ( humming and playing

24
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,777
        Wander, are you... sick?

25
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,947
   Me sick? No way.             

26
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:26,785
Sylvia, I can assure you        
that I am the farthest thing    
in the world                    

27
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,587
        from being...           
      ( sneezes loudly )        

28
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,192
            ...sick.            

29
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,727
 I'm fine, Sylvia.              

30
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,964
Really. I have too much         
to do today to be sick.         

31
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,134
   I'll just power through      
      with the power...         

32
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,404
  friendship, smile, sunshine.  

33
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,973
    Banjo face or something.    

34
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,809
           Oh, no. The only way 
        you're gonna get better 

35
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,144
        is if you get some rest.

36
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,113
        I'll take care          
        of everything.          

37
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,381
Oh, don't go out of             
your way for me.                

38
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,617
I got this.                     
I got this.                     

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,453
         I got this,            
         I got this.            

40
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,989
     I... I did it!             

41
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,227
    Okay, I'm gonna go get      
    some wood for a fire.       

42
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,628
    You stay here and rest.     

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,464
             Okay.              

44
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,806
Wander, what are you...         

45
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,441
            Helping you collect 
                      firewood. 

46
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,610
      ( thunder crashing )      

47
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:27,079
      You don't have to         
      do anything, okay?        

48
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,647
         If you need something, 
                      just ask. 

49
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,749
      Is there anything         
          you need?             

50
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:34,086
    Well, a glass of water      
        might be nice.          

51
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:37,489
          One water,            
       coming right...          

52
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,557
             ...up.             

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,829
           - Stay.              
        - You got it.           

54
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,002
     Just as soon as I help you 
 start this fire... ( sneezes ) 

55
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,204
        Buddy. ( sighs )        

56
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,039
      I know you always         
         wanna help,            

57
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,376
  but sometimes, you have to    
 take care of yourself first.   

58
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,178
 But I can't be sick.           

59
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,780
I'm already way behind on       
my morning helping routine.     

60
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:05,984
   If I don't help everyone     
      who needs helping,        

61
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,121
       terrible things          
        might happen.           

62
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,024
    Yeah, like you getting      
so sick you can't help anyone.  

63
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,659
       So you miss out          
       on a few chores.         

64
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,860
       It's not the end         
       of the universe.         

65
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,229
       ( muffled groan )        

66
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,699
        How about I do          
your helping routine for you?   

67
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,035
           Really?              
        I don't know.           

68
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,703
         It's kind of           
        a tall order.           

69
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,873
    Come on. You've helped      
      me so many times.         

70
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,175
      It's time for you         
     to let me help you.        

71
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,177
      Just tell me what         
      you need me to do         

72
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:36,348
and I will go do it while you   
  stay here and do nothing.     

73
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,483
       Well... okay.            

74
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:42,521
I usually start my morning      
by making brekkies for you,     

75
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,390
me, and any locals              
that might be around.           

76
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,597
Did you feed                    
all the locals?                 

77
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,136
All the locals?                 

78
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,774
   Next, I usually go give      
    Buster a good scratch       

79
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,109
        behind the ears.        

80
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,212
     You've gotta go hit        
      the snooze button         

81
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,214
       on Lord Hater's          
         alarm clock,           

82
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,350
      or he'll be really        
       cranky all day.          

83
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,851
         ( screeching )         

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,255
     Give the black cube        
       a banjo lesson.          

85
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,363
 Raise the soles of Peepers'    
shoes another eighth of an inch.

86
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:27,799
       Oh, way to grow,         
      Commander Peepers.        

87
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,901
       <i> Let's get awesome.</i>      

88
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:33,772
  And feed Emperor Awesome's    
       white tigrexes.          

89
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,647
Oh, the Watchdogs'              
intramural tetherball finals    

90
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,649
are today,                      
and they need a referee.        

91
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,983
      ( whistle blowing )       

92
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,219
       - Point, Barry.          
         - Whoo hoo!            

93
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,921
Give the floor at Blorpee's     
a good mopping.                 

94
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:53,725
       You missed a...          
      ( sneezes ) spot.         

95
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,297
Double check that no one        
on Okeydokeyia needs help/      

96
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,399
          We never do.          

97
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,901
Hit Hater's                     
snooze button again.            

98
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,905
         ( screeching )         

99
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:10,909
Change Huckleberry              
Knucklehead's diaper.           

100
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:14,479
Throw out anything that         
doesn't have a name in          
the Watchdogs' fridge.          

101
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,984
Return any                      
lost socks.                     

102
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,993
       ( sobbing loudly )       

103
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,608
     Isn't that your sock?      

104
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,011
                Oh, yeah.       

105
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:51,750
Make sure to hit                
Lord Hater's snooze button      
one more time.                  

106
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,760
        - ( sneezes )           
       - ( screeching )         

107
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,499
Oh, and there's                 
one more thing.                 

108
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,068
Water Dominator's cactus.       

109
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,970
       What? But... wait.       

110
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,673
      Why does Dominator        
     even have a cactus?        

111
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,308
       ( sniffing wetly )       

112
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,243
       I left a cactus          
    in her guest bathroom       

113
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,745
        the last time           
        we were there.          

114
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,584
I thought it really             
brightened up the place.        

115
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,352
( coughs, sniffs )              
But you're right, Syl.          

116
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:31,623
I shouldn't ask you             
to do something so dangerous.   

117
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,527
 I will do it myself.           

118
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,095
     Flab drass it, Wander.     

119
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,264
     Crab-hammerin' cactus.     

120
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,033
        Where is this           
    guest bathroom anyway?      

121
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,569
      - ( loud sneeze )         
          - Oh, no.             

122
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,940
Wander!                         

123
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,176
          Hey, Sylvia.          

124
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,116
      Wait. Is this the...      

125
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,118
  Is this the guest bathroom?   

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,587
    But where's the cactus?     

127
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,024
Yeah, that's what               
I wanted to tell you.           

128
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,927
I actually think                
I might've just dreamed         

129
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,296
about getting                   
Dominator a cactus.             

130
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,066
You know what?                  
We should go get                
her a cactus.                   

131
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,868
 Call it Spike.                 

132
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,303
           ( sighs )            

133
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,042
         Stay there...          

134
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,077
           and rest!            

135
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,312
             Okay?              

136
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,648
         ( sniffles )           
        Okay, Sylvia.           

137
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,952
           Oh, you seriously do 
             all this every day 
         before I'm even awake? 

138
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,821
        You're a very           
        heavy sleeper.          

139
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,957
              I could use a nap 
          now, that's for sure. 

140
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,927
          - Sylvia!!            
        - What is it?           

141
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,963
      I forgot to visit         
         Ms. Myrtle.            

142
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,299
      - Who's what now?         
  - ( sniffles very wetly )     

143
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,802
Every week, I visit             
this kindly old lady,           
Ms. Myrtle,                     

144
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,737
and bring her a can             
of snickerdoodles,              

145
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,073
so we can chat,                 
we can catch up.                

146
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,175
Oh, she loves snickerdoodles.   

147
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,443
I can't let her down.           

148
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,847
     Oh, Wander, you not        
     visiting an old lady       

149
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,982
        is not the end          
       of the universe.         

150
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,851
  But, but, but!                

151
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,686
       Wander, whoa, whoa, whoa.

152
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,988
    Okay. I will go visit       
     Ms. Myrtle for you.        

153
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,124
      But you have to promise me

154
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,493
              that you're gonna 
                stay right here 

155
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,995
       and finally get          
       some rest, okay?         

156
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,798
           ( sighs )            

157
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
           I promise.           

158
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,936
        Good. Now sleep.        

159
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:28,273
          You got it.           

160
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,012
           Sylvia!              
     The snickerdoodles!        

161
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,953
     Huh. Weird place for       
   some old biddy to live.      

162
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,522
          Ms. Myrtle?           

163
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,057
                 Ms. Myrtle?    

164
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,260
           - Ms...              
     - ( loud rumbling )        

165
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,101
          Ms. Myrtle?           

166
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,884
      I'm coming, Sylvia.       

167
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:19,891
Who dares disturb the slumber   
        of Ms. Myrtle,          

168
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:24,362
     the eternal turtle,        
    keeper of the cosmos,       

169
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:30,268
  weaver of the very fabric     
       of the galaxy?!          

170
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,442
 Only I can save the universe.  

171
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:43,682
         Must deliver           
     snicker... doodles.        

172
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:47,319
          ( sneezes )           

173
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:57,362
   Ms. Myrtle, please don't     
    destroy the universe.       

174
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,864
      I'm here, I'm here.       

175
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,133
   I brought your snicker...    

176
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,136
( laughing )                    
And then the ballet             
dancer says,                    

177
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,772
"Annihilation?                  
I thought her name was Susan."  

178
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,308
          ( laughter )          

179
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,943
Myrtle?                         

180
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,212
           Oh, hello, Wander.   

181
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,949
         Your delightful friend 
        Sylvia and I are having 
             such a grand time. 

182
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,585
       But, but, but...         
         the cookies.           

183
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,654
          Why hasn't            
     the universe ended?        

184
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,990
        Oh, Wander dear,        

185
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,891
      though I do enjoy         
         your visits,           

186
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,160
   Sylvia said you were sick,   

187
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,130
       so I understand          
    why you couldn't come.      

188
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:36,001
          It's all right to let 
              other people help 
                 you, you know. 

189
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:42,107
               It's not the end 
               of the universe. 

190
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,342
          ( laughter )          

191
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:51,316
Yeah, never hurts to            
let someone... help.            

192
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,253
       ( snoring )              

193
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,288
              Snickerdoodle?    

194
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,290
          ( laughs )            
           Oh, no.              

195
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,859
  I can't stand those things.   

196
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,694
           ( laughs )           

197
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,629
     Seriously, get them        
       out of my sight,         

198
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,264
       or I'll destroy          
        the universe.           

199
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,565
                        Wow!    

200
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,338
   Sylvia, there's a whole      
    little planet in here       

201
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,207
     full of these little       
     itty-bitty Bitties.        

202
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,711
          Wander, put that down 
            before he sees you. 

203
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,685
   You dare touch the stuff     
of the mighty wizard Neckbeard, 

204
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,188
   the all-knowing naysayer.    

205
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,222
           ( coughs )           

206
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,724
         Sorry, sorry.          

207
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,326
   He was just making sure      
   no one else touches it.      

208
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,396
    And now, he's putting       
   it back, right, Wander?      

209
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,201
( sighs ) Look, I'm like        
the most laid-back guy there is.

210
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,104
But this is my shop             
full of rare and dangerous      

211
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,840
magic items too complex         
for your tiny minds             
to comprehend.                  

212
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,509
So if you don't wanna unleash   
the wrath of the greatest       
wizard in the universe,         

213
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,678
you gotta treat                 
my word as law.                 

214
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,747
     Law one: no touching!      

215
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,584
Especially not my orb.          
Feel me, muchacho?              

216
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,123
       Sorry, O great Neckbeard.

217
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,525
     It won't happen again.     

218
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,927
So you want me                  
to help you find something      

219
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,029
to deal with                    
this "Dominator" lady?          

220
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,465
         Yes. We heard you have 
         an item of great power 

221
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,869
     that can zap her as        
      far away from this        
     galaxy as possible.        

222
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,638
       - Is that right?         
            - No.               

223
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,774
  I have something that will    
       translocate her          

224
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,575
   as far away as possible,     
        but "zapping,"          

225
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,277
        I have no idea          
        what that is.           

226
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,447
        Okay. We heard you have 
               an item that can 

227
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,416
         translocate her as far 
              away as possible. 

228
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,653
    Please, O mighty Neckbeard, 
          you're our only hope. 

229
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:14,092
       ( loud groan )           

230
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,460
        Fine. Follow me.        

231
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,832
     Translocate you into       
the next dimension, you big...  

232
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,267
      Wander, no!               

233
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,768
     Even if he is being        
         a real jerk,           

234
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,337
      this guy may have         
the only thing that can help us.

235
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,075
         So stay put,           
     don't question him,        

236
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,745
       and stay out of          
        his business.           

237
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,516
What bad can come from learning 
   about these little guys?     

238
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,352
  I mean, the more you know,    
      the more you grow.        

239
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,355
       No. No knowin',          
         no growin',            

240
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,157
         or we'll be            
     throwin' outta here,       

241
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,194
    and Dominator will be       
 blowin' our galaxy to bits.    

242
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,362
Well, your point                
did rhyme, so okay.             

243
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,572
Oh, what could one little       
eyeball in somebody else's      
business hurt?                  

244
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,042
                 ( gasps )      

245
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,777
      Look at all those         
        little Bitties          

246
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,445
   on their itty-bitty world    

247
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,948
   leading their itty-bitty     
         Bitty lives.           

248
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,616
     Why, it's Billy Bitty.     

249
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,952
 He's lost his entire family.   
           Oh, no.              

250
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,720
       Will he have to          
      scour the universe        

251
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,289
     leaving no stone...        
    oh no, there they are.      

252
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,791
    It's Billy's wife Betty,    

253
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,826
     kissing him sweetly        
     on his way to work.        

254
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,529
    Meanwhile, Betty meets      
  her sister-in-law Beatrice    

255
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,732
   a professional masseuse      
    who's unlucky in love.      

256
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,468
   Unbeknownst to Beatrice,     
    her true love Benedict      

257
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,637
      is on the opposite        
        side of town,           

258
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,572
        searching for           
      something to fill         

259
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,407
      the Beatrice-sized        
      hole in his heart.        

260
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,410
      If only they could        
       find each other.         

261
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,547
        But I promised          
    not to mess with 'em.       

262
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,251
            Whoops.             

263
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,723
     ( happy squealing )        
    Romance is in the air.      

264
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,658
         What was that?         

265
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,729
        - Banjo, huh?           
        - ( humming )           

266
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,565
    Yeah, well, I play...       
        the Theremin.           

267
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,601
      - ( tiny screams )        
          - Oh, no!             

268
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,206
   Oh, yeah, Theremins are      
      super complicated.        

269
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,440
   When people hear I play,     
      they're all, like,        

270
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:13,711
           "No way!             
      That's too hard."         

271
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,446
    But then I show them,       
      and they're, like,        

272
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,016
      "Stop. Stop being         
    a wizard immediately,       

273
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,617
    and be a pro musician."     

274
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,452
    And I'm all, "Thanks,       
      but I'm killing it        

275
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,521
       in the magic biz."       

276
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,123
    Hey, speaking of magic,     

277
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,425
     do you have any idea       
where to find this zapping...   

278
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,360
  I mean, this translocating    
           device?              

279
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:35,233
       Because we know          
your time is so very valuable,  

280
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,202
      and we are ashamed        
to waste even a second of it.   

281
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,805
       Do not question          
      my methods, lady.         

282
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,908
       I am Neckbeard,          
  the all-knowing naysayer,     

283
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,777
        and my methods          
      shall be revealed         

284
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,314
     when I... see... fit!      

285
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,352
                      ( sighs ) 
        I think it's over here. 

286
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,889
     ( Bitties screaming )      

287
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,259
              Whew! You're safe.

288
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,428
               Oh, uh... hi.    

289
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,831

    That was a close one.

 how foolish and lame we are

two different things.

00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,574
                    Translocate.

334
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,543
                     Okay, okay.

335
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,111
                Oblivion mirror.

336
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,180
                It'll magically 
             transport anything 

337
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,048
        to the farthest regions 
               of the universe, 

338
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,217
               never to return, 
        but it only works once, 

339
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,852
        so you gotta be careful.

340
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,054
Finally.                        
Things are lookin' up.          

341
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,456
     ( Bitties shrieking )      

342
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,291
     Empathy, not enemies.      

343
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,593
  Please there's plenty more    
impressive things in the galaxy 

344
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,628
 to be into than little ol' me. 

345
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,599
There's supernovas and meteor   
showers and puppies and banjos  

346
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,236
 and best friends and triple    
       pickle pie and--         

347
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:28,106
     Do you have any idea       
      what you've done?         

348
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,641
         ( screaming )          

349
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,643
       These guys were          
         mint in box.           

350
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,313
     They aren't ready to       
understand a bigger universe.   

351
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,647
     They've already seen       
          too much.             

352
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,716
         That's crazy.          

353
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,618
      The more you know,        
      the more you grow.        

354
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,887
     Wrong, 'cause nobody       
     knows more than me.        

355
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,790
     And what they don't        
    know won't hurt them.       

356
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,758
          Here. Oblivion mirror.

357
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,627
          Use this on Dominator 
 to send her wherever you want. 

358
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,329
      Now get outta here!       

359
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,831
You mean it was                 
right there the whole...        

360
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,167
Oh, never mind.                 
I thought we'd                  
never get outta here.           

361
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,070
         But Sylvia,            
         the Bitties.           

362
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,839
        Buddy, I know,          
but we've got bigger problems   

363
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,108
    than those small fries.     

364
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,778
 If we don't stop Dominator,    
   there may be no galaxy.      

365
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,747
     Besides, aren't they       
 better off not knowing about   

366
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,150
    all the horrible stuff      
      that's out there?         

367
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,218
            - No.               
           - Good.              
        - Wait, what?!          

368
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,689
          Hey, nay!             
          I say nay!            

369
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,791
     ( Bitties screaming )      

370
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,327
          NECKBEARD:            
     Magic. Magic, magic,       
        magic, magic!           

371
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,696
        Magic, magic,           
     magic, magic. Magic!       

372
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,698
  Just because you act like     
     you know everything        

373
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,500
    - doesn't mean you do.      
           - Magic!             

374
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,536
 You can't keep other people    
         in the dark            

375
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,970
    just to make yourself       
         seem smart.            

376
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,908
     Magic, magic, magic.       
     Magic, magic. Magic!       

377
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,882
  Magic!                        

378
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,424
             Magic!             

379
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,804
              Wow!              

380
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,810
          ( growling )          

381
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,585
        ( deep voice )          
           Magic!!              

382
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,689
         Hey! I have            
        what you want,          

383
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,325
    you have what I want.       
    Unwinnable situation.       

384
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,926
 Now give me the orb.           

385
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,395
       Wander, we need          
         that mirror.           

386
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,531
But Sylvia, everybody           
deserves a chance               

387
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,865
to try and understand           
the universe.                   

388
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,834
       ( all squeaking )        

389
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,569
                   Sorry, buddy.

390
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,438
                   Say good-bye 
               to your Bitties. 

391
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,675
        'Cause they're goin' on 
                   a long trip. 

392
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,111
               Yo, know-it-all. 
                         Catch! 

393
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,513
       Not in the face,         
       not in the face!         

394
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,050
             Noooo!             

395
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,386
      Not cool. They're         
     too small and stupid       

396
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,188
     to survive out there       
       in the universe.         

397
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,923
    They're too primitive.      
          They're...            

398
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,125
         ( squeaking )          

399
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,893
        ...totally fine?        

400
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,796
            Sylvia, that mirror 
              only had one use. 

401
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,965
               We won't be able 
        to send Dominator away. 

402
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,735
Good. That'll give              
the Bitties a fresh             
new galaxy to explore           

403
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,570
where nobody else               
can mess with 'em.              

404
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:13,938
And I'm sure,                   
if we keep exploring,           

405
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,240
we'll figure                    
something else out, too.        

406
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:19,210
After all, the more you know,   
  the more you grow, right?     

407
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,782
       You are totally          
     gonna pay for that.        

408
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,151
       That'll be 17.50         
        for the mirror          

409
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,520
          and 37.99             
         for the orb.           

410
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,702
          That's amazing!       

411
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,406
            Amazing!            

412
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,351
      ( Theremin playing )      

413
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,320
     ( Bitties exclaiming )
