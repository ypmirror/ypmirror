00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,877

      to be the best in

21
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,111
      Ah! A giant dom bot?      

22
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:20,579
    Oh, the poor Binglebops.    

23
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,748
    They just refurbished       
     their Ferris wheel.

     For all your troubles.

Have you met                    
my daughter,                    

28
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,291
the princess?                   

29
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,467
What did he say,                
my dear?                        

30
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,969
        It never hurts          
           to help.             

31
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,806
        What a show-off!        

32
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,474
 What an inspiration!           

33
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,009
       BOTH: Wait, what?        

34
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,978
                    Inspiration?

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,846
         Wander, the only thing 
          that guy was inspired 
                     by was us. 

36
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,816
             I mean, green hat, 
                   orange fuzz. 

37
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,519
                    But where's 
              the flap-drassin' 
           heart and sincerity? 

38
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:36,622
       But he actually          
  took out a giant dom bot.     

39
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,791
        And <i> nobody's</i>           
    been able to do that.       

40
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,460
           Even you.            

41
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:45,364
     Well, maybe this guy       
   is too good to be true.      

42
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:48,000
       We need to track         
  this wandering do-gooder.     

43
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,835
          WANDER: Huh.          

44
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,670
     I thought I saw him        
  take off towards Flendar.     

45
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,106
    There's the Flendarians.    

46
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,674
       There's another          
        giant dom bot           

47
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,843
    coming to destroy them      
   and all they hold dear.      

48
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,679
        But no hotshot.         

49
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,815
    ( gasps ) No hotshot!       
 Oh, no. Who will save them?!   

50
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,985
         ( shrieking )          

51
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,354
You know what?                  
Tromp that guy.                 

52
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,658
If he can take down a dom bot,  
I can take down a dom bot.      

53
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,893
Come on, Wander.                
We got this.                    

54
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,362
         Um, Sylvia...          

55
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:21,900
   Hey, dumb bot, here come     
    the real hero-ooooes.       

56
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,213
Have you met                    
the princess?                   

57
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,887
    It never hurts to help.     

58
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,724
           Oh, yeah!            

59
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,726
Did you see                     
what he just did?               

60
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,662
       He saved us from         
   that dangerous dom bot.      

61
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,931
       No, he shoved us         
        out of the way          

62
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,334
  of that dangerous dom bot     
  so he could get the glory.    

63
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:59,771
     Huh. Methinks I spy        
    a green-eyed monster.       

64
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,574
  Where? I'll take him down     
  before that hotshot does.     

65
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:07,379
             Sylvia, are you... 
                       jealous? 

66
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,848
Of him? Please.                 

67
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,383
   There's something phony      
       in his bologna,          

68
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,085
    and I'm gonna prove it.

81
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,960
                And also Sylvia

83
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,798
   Okay, I've triangulated      
       the bot attacks,         

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,500

85

        this planet is

86
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,838
    Finally, we'll be able      
    to stop the hotshot...      

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,908
 I mean bots... Stop the bots   
      once and for all.         

88
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,077
        Okay, Wander?           
           Wander?              

89
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,115
                    Sylvia, I'm 
       the strong, silent type. 

90
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,918
                Pretend I'm not 
             talking right now. 

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,020
I don't know what               
you see in that guy.            

92
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,824
       Sure, he may be          
a little "grrr" for my taste,   

93
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,926
   but he's stoppin' bots,      
        helpin' folks,          

94
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,928
    and makin' people happy.    

95
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,264
      Maybe we can learn        
   a thing or two from him.     

96
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,999
           Now... sh.           

97
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,677
       Oh, no, you don't.       

98
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,113
That bot is mine!               

99
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51,850
     Hello, Mr. Hotshot.        
     Long-time follower.        

100
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,052
Literally. I've been following  
you around all over the place.  

101
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,292
   I've been trying to ask      
 if you might like to team up   

102
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,993
        and help us out.        

103
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,162
     Your hover speeder's       
         really loud,           

104
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,031
      and I don't think         
       you can hear me.         

105
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,534
     Ha! Not so hot now,        
           are ya?              

106
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,937
         ( screeching )         

107
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,474
    Okay, bot, prepare to...    

108
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,509
        ( Sylvia gulps )        

109
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,878
          ( meekly )            
       Meet your doom.          

110
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,880
        ( angry snort )         

111
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,081
        ( Sylvia yells )        

112
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,325
         Ah... stop.            
           Get off.             

113
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,494
     You're gonna damage        
        the hardware.           

114
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:36,595
             What?              

115
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,334
       ( sheepish laugh )       

116
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,236
        You should see          
     your face right now.       

117
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,172
       It's all, like,          
  "Waaah, I'm so confused!"     

118
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,242
               Enlighten me.    

119
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,078
Uh, well, so,                   
like, my cousin and I,          

120
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,880
        we found this           
       busted dom bot,          

121
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,015
and he sorta thought,           
why don't we fix it up?         

122
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,017
        And I pretend           
       to attack towns,         

123
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,952
       and then he can          
  rush in and save the day,     

124
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,088
and get the reward and smooch   
    all the pretty ladies.      

125
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,091
          Smooch all            
      the pretty ladies?        

126
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,959
            Oh, no.             

127
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,928
            WANDER: What's your 
          favorite way to help? 

128
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,130
      Mine is every way.        
       Where you from?          

129
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,299
Hey, who are you                
under this hat?                 

130
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,001
             Get off me, Wander.

131
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,640
      Yeah, yeah, I know.       

132
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,142
    Gasp. Brad Starlight.       
            You?!               

133
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,310
            But why?            

134
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,612
     Because I am strong.       
         I am a man.            

135
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,880
       I have a big chin.       

136
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,248
        I am the hero.          
         Me, me, me!            

137
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,984
This should be                  
my thunder,                     

138
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,886
and you and your                
dumb steed aren't               
gonna take it from me.          

139
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,088
                  Brad, there's 
             plenty of thunder. 

140
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,424
 Maybe there's a way you can    
still help us stop Dominator.   

141
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,393
        Stop Dominator?         

142
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,795
          ( laughs )            
        Simple jester.          

143
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,831
I can't very well help planets  
    and smooch princesses       

144
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,232
      if I'm dead, can I?       

145
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,501
        But you're not          
      actually helping.         

146
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,102
  Aha, quiet, girl.             

147
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,971
It never hurts                  
to help... yourself.            

148
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,940
     Chad! Okay, take two.      

149
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,508
   I'll go back to Point A,     
     you dispose of them,       

150
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,343
       attack the town,         
        I'll ride in,           

151
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,111
 do the thing with the thing,   
and the money and the smooching,

152
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,147
 and the fame and the glory.    
          Good? Go!             

153
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,583
 Who's the wandering hero now?  

154
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,154
       Ow! Oh, my knee.         
           My knee!             

155
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,522
            Shut up!            

156
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,601
          Yeah, so,             
    sorry about this, but,      

157
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:25,504
       prepare to meet          
     your doom, I guess.        

158
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,109
       SYLVIA: Oh, no.          
    That's a real dom bot.      

159
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,211
Wait, what?                     

160
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,215
Oh, I forgot.                   
I have, like, a thing           

161
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,185
somewhere where there's         
not a real killer robot. Later. 

162
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,239
       Oh, poor Bradley.        

163
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,375
      He's so misguided         
      and bad at things.        

164
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,076
   That bot's gonna kill him!   

165
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,078
            - Yep.              
          - Sylvia!             

166
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,814
    But they're so crush-y      
   and laser-y and hurt-y.      

167
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,884
      And Brad is so... Bradley.

168
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,753
NH2H.                           

169
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,321
Besides, we're                  
his only hope.                  

170
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,391
         Fine, fine.            
   We'll go be real heroes.     

171
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,232
          You, bot.             
   Prepare to meet your...      

172
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,536
   Chad! You know the face      
        is off limits.          

173
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,773
 Jawlines like these are not    
  something to take lightly.    

174
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:39,578
      Chad! I'm telling         
       your... mother.          

175
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,780
        BOT: No mother.         

176
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,382
        Only Dominator.         

177
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,384
          - Oh, no.             
        - ( crashing )          

178
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,086
           Oh, help!            

179
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,921
       Somebody help me!        

180
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,157
                ( loud revving )

181
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,862
           Sylvia! Whoo hoo!    

182
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,431
Wander, sh!                     

183
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,300
We're trying to do              
the strong, silent type thing.  

184
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,969
             Oh, yeah, sorry.   

185
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,139
          BRAD: Help!           

186
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,210
         Not the chin.          

187
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,169
          Thank you.            
          Thank you.            

188
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,339
 This was a hard-won victory,   
    but under my guidance,      

189
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,275
      even dumb animals         
     and silly sidekicks        

190
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,177
    can be taught to fight      
    the forces of fright.       

191
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,916
      Yeah, thanks for the help.

192
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,319
Well, to the victor             
go the spoils, huh, hotshot?    

193
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,322

        Okay, okay, so          
        a Flendarian,           

216
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,920
                     a Kremlon,

00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,390

         dancer says,           

219
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,893

                  Tone it down, 
                  will ya, Dee? 

338
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,605
        - You're gonna          
        get us eaten.           
     - I don't think so.        

339
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,007
  These losers need to learn    
         what happens           

340
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,376
        when they try           
       to threaten me!          

341
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,283
       That was so rude!        

342
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,285
          All right,            
      listen up, chumps.        

343
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,187
       I'm the new boss         
         around here.           

344
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,122
     You'd all better do        
        as I tell you           

345
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,691
  or you'll end up just like    
your little frightened friend.  

346
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,527
     ( monster shrieking )      

347
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,428
      What are you doing?!      

348
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,364
       Uh, taking over          
     the seedy underworld       

349
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,932
      so that we can run        
 this planet from the shadows   

350
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,835
   with an iron fist. Duh!      
    Come on, it'll be fun.      

351
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,770
          No. No way.           

352
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,273
      This has all gone         
      way-ay-ay too far.        

353
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,008
  I did not sign up for this.   

354
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,318
      What? Hey, stop it.       

355
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,886
     I command you to stop.     

356
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,155
                    Command me? 
      Who do you think you are? 

357
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,791
   I thought we were friends.   

358
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,560
  Friends are supposed to do    
  what you tell them to do.     

359
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,395
            What, like robots?  

360
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,697
     That's not what friends do.

361
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,800
   Friends help each other out, 
              but they're still 
              their own people. 

362
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,503
      Speaking of which,        
     how about helping me       

363
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,605
     fight off this thing?      

364
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,042
    No one gets to tell me      
         what to do.            

365
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,843
     Fight it off yourself.     

366
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,512
     All right, minions,        
        who's with me?          

367
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,814
   Our boss is in trouble.      
      We gotta help him.        

368
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,317
        Seriously? Fine!        

369
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,186
      I don't even need         
        you lame-o's.           

370
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,988
       ( Sylvia screams )       

371
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,765
     I can't hold him off       
         much longer.           

372
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,334
      Run! Get outta here!      

373
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,737
          I'm trying!           

374
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,908
     Sylvia! What are you       
      doing down there?         

375
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,042
           Granddad!            

376
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,844
             Kids!              

377
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,112
          ( roaring )           

378
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,120
You have no idea how glad       
I am to see you, buddy.         

379
00:20:56,122 --> 00:21:01,058
   Lady, I do not care much     
  for that friend of yours.     

380
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,793
      Who was she anyway?       

381
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,862
I have no idea.                 

382
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,064
And trust me,                   
she's not my friend.            

383
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,766
            Oh, that reminds me.

384
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,868
 Guess who I just saw leaving   
     as I was coming in?        

385
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,737
          Dominator!            
         Crazy, huh?            

386
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,872
         Just threw this jacket 
       into a bus driver's face 

387
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,607
            causing a three-car 
          pile-up and took off. 

388
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,242
                Wonder what she 
                was doing here? 

389
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,944
Wait. What?                     

390
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,812
          I'm back!             
       Did you miss me?         

391
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,582
      So today I learned        
    that friends are dumb,      

392
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,417
       and way overrated.       

393
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,918
        They don't do           
  what you tell them to do,     

394
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,820
   and sometimes, they even     
 try and tell you what to do.   

395
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,722
     Can you believe that?      

396
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,791
      I don't even know         
   why everyone makes such      
    a big deal about them.      

397
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,662
      How's that update         
        coming along?           

398
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,931
              Ugh!              

399
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:44,402
       ( chair creaking )       

400
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,882
       ( horns honking )        

401
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,321
     ( honking continues )
