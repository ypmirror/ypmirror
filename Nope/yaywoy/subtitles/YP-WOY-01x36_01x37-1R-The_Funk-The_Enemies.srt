    almost conquered, okay?

52
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,021
how fun evil can be.

               That's fine.     

59
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,249

00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,218

       Come and get me!         

234
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,776
       TOGETHER: Wander?        

235
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,778
        I can't believe         
   he came here to stop me!     

236
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,713
          Whoa, whoa.           
    Came here to stop you?      

237
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,483
           Uh, yeah,            
    he's my greatest enemy.     

238
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,486
      WANDER: Hey, guys,        
   hide and seek, let's go!     

239
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,624
       Wander ruined my wedding!

240
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,092
           If it wasn't for him,

241
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,628
           I'd be married       
     to a super pretty princess!

242
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,765
So? Wander ruined               
dozens of my plans,             

243
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,633
   one of which also            
involved my wedding!            

244
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,968
              Really?           
                 How?           

245
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,870
His dumb friend Sylvia          
      was in disguise.          

246
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,405
             You mean his steed.

247
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,707
   You almost married his horse!

248
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,676
It was a very convincing        
disguise.                       

249
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,512
                   WANDER:      
   Bet you can't find me!       

250
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,514
          ( growling )          

251
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,482
Want to put this whole          
sword thing on hold for a sec   

252
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,051
and go destroy him?             

253
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,820
     So you're offering me      
   your services to help me     

254
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,989
          in my quest           
      to destroy Wander?        

255
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,390
 Yeah, sure, whatever--         

256
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,692
               By Zargo, I'm in.

257
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:22,927
       To battle!               

258
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,633
    LORD HATER: Here, follow me.

259
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,501
                     Great idea.

260
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,570
       The scout goes first,    
   the leader takes up the rear.

261
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,872
      What--                    
No, I'm the leader.             

262
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,607
   That's why                   
I'm in the front.               

263
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,375

           Wander is the leader!

hide and go seek right now?

                      No matter.

288
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,551
           I will devise a snare
               most devious     

289
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,753

I'm totally the one in charge.

I'm, like,

                    Fine.       
             Set your own snare.

293
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,728
               We'll see        
       who snares Wander first. 

294
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,530
                 It shall be me

295
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,198

    Man, those guys are not     
    very good at this game.     

298
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,707
         Now, Wander,           
       that's not fair.         

299
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,875
     They might compensate      
 for their poor seeking skills  

300
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,944

305
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,618
  Someone is in need of help,   
        I must be off!          

306
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,822

  the most horrible trouble!

                Brad, it's me.  

317
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,015
    Thank goodness              
I found you first.              

318
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,717
For roaming these woods

Oh, it's you.                   

321
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,591
That was your plan?             
      Please!                   

322
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,926
    That would have             
     never worked!              
    It just worked on you!      

323
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,629
      You totally just thought  
     I was a stupid fair maiden.

324

    A beautiful fair maiden.    

325
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,767
I mean,                         
can we try my plan now?         

326
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,201
     It's way better.           

327
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,605
             Fine.              
           Whatever.            

328
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,540
 This is the exact same plan.   

329
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,609
            It certainly is not.

  My high cheekbones make me    
  a much more effective lure.

      Also, I'm a redhead.

        hide and seek?          

335
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,924
Or are we playing               
some kinda dress-up game        
with each other?                

336
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,128

you gotta let me hide           
again first.                    

338
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,331

  No, I don't have the sword    
    but I captured Wander!      

341
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,611
          Long story!           
       Ready to torture.        

342
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,181
      Not so fast, Hater!       

343
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,016
Only one of us                  
shall have the duty,            

344
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,618

347
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,594
   Snared!                      

348
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,603
     Ha ha!                     

349
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,847
        Um, if either of you all

350
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,349
   need a refresher on the rules
        of hide and seek--      

351
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,951
             Quiet!             

352
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,159
LORD HATER: He's mine!          
       BRAD: No!                

353
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,961
       ( screaming )            

354
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,295
          LORD HATER:           
      I hate you so much.       

355
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,030
      ( screaming )             

356
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,707
      ( both shouting )         

357
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,912
Well, I'm gonna go hide again   
so Sylvia can find me.          

358
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,114
Y'all join in                   
whenever you're ready.          

359
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,917
BRAD: That's enough.            

360
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,021
( gasping )                     

361
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,761
           TOGETHER:            
     You let him get away!      

362
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,731
              Me?               
          Yeah, you!            

363
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,900
If you'd just given me your half
   of the sword of synergy,     

364
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,068
   I could have destroyed him!  

365
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,007
   ( evil snicker )             

366
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,744
 SYLVIA: 4,999,997...           

367
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:44,248
 4,999,998...                   

368
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,419
 4,999,999...                   

369
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,254
Five million.                   

370
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,190
          ( yawning )           

371
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,759
     Hoo boy, I sure love       
these "hide and seek" sessions. 

372
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,427
Best idea I ever had.           

373
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,396
      Wander gets a game,       
         I get a nap,           

374
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,265
        and everything          
     works out just fine--      

375
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,400
     ( explosion )              

376
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,701
           Uh-oh.               

377
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,474
         TOGETHER: Yes!         

378
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:14,378
  We have assembled             
the sword of synergy!           

379
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:16,914
             And together!      

380
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,416
 Each contributing equally---   

381
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,751
      And taking exactly        
       half the credit--        

382
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:24,755
   TOGETHER: We will use it     
      to destroy Wander!        

383
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,324
           Now where is he?     

384
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,461
                      BRAD: Aha!

385
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,301
       ( evil laughter )        

386
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,936
     TOGETHER: Finally my--     

387
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:44,041
I mean,  <i>our </i> most hated enemy  
           will be destroyed.   

388
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,277
          Even though           
     this may be the end,       

389
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,380
       I'm just so happy        
  the last thing I get to see   

390
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,482
       is good and evil         
putting aside their differences 

391
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,451
to work together.               

392
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,952
         Stop being so positive!

393
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,520
   Just ignore him,             
it's kind of his thing.         

394
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,256
          I'm serious!          

395
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,857
      Brad, it's so nice        
     that you talked Hater      

396
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,560
     over to the side of good.  

397
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,061
 Say what now?                  

398
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,263
          Why, thank you,       
                  Wander.       

399
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,864
  He is quite the scoundrel.    
           Hold on!             

400
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,467
If anything, I converted you    
        to the side of evil.    

401
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,302
            Please!             

402
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,104
             I demurred         
     for the sake of compromise,

403
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,339
   but I am clearly the dominant
    force in this partnership!  

404
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,307
Are you kidding me?             

405
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,476
                   Look at him! 
               He's a good guy! 

406
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,379
   A helpful, friendly good guy 
      that you're helping me    

407
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,481
                 destroy        
         for the forces of evil!

408
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,483
            Nuh-uh!             
         I'm the hero!          

409
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,386
     And heroes fight bad guys, 
        and kiss pretty ladies! 

410
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,788
Ugh, working with you           
was a big mistake.              
Give me the sword!              

411
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,790
 I'll destroy him myself.       

412
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,792
                       No!      
                 I wanna do it! 

413
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,994
   Even when you guys fight,    

414
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,297
          it's clear            
 you make a really good team.   

415
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,466
     TOGETHER: We do not!       
         ( growling )           

416
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,878
         ( screaming )          

417
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,384
Wander!                         
Are you okay, buddy?            

418
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,453
                 Sylvia!        
           You found me!        

419
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,922
              They're having    
           a bit of a BFF tiff. 

420
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,058
      TOGETHER: We are not BFFs!

421
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,392
       Not my face.             

422
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,428
             We should probably 
                 get going.     

423
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,530
Okey-doke.                      
Also, it's your                 
turn to hide.                   

424
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,398
          LORD HATER:           
      Ow, watch the ribs!       

425
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,399
        BRAD: Stop it!          
           Stop it!             

426
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,300
    LORD HATER: I hate you!     

427
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,369
     BRAD: I hate you more!     

428
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,142
          ( grunting )          

429
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,280
          BRAD: Ouch!           

430
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,548
          LORD HATER:           
       Oh, are you okay?        

431
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,350
       ( screaming )            

432
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,418
       BRAD: Stop it!           

433
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,853
       LORD HATER: I hate you!
