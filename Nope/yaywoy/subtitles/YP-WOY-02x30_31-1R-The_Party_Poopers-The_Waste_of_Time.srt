Nothing. Nothing                
at all, sir.                    

76
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,962
       Okay, okay, okay.        

77
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,730
      Time to get serious.

00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,900
            Serious.

              Don't fall behind.

80
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,138
       ( gasping laugh )        

81
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,575
               And don't forget 
                     to wipe... 

82
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,810
 your feet.                     

83
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,614
This shall indeed               
be a long night.

85
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:54,566
       Please wait here         
until you are summoned to move  

86
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,669
       into the bowels          
        of the temple.          

87
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,572
Okay, Wander, we need           
to get our presentation perfect 

88
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,941
if we're gonna impress          
these guys.                     

89
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,610
Bow, bow, curtsy,               
step left...                    

90
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,778
 Hey.                           

91
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,448
How are you keeping             
a straight face?                

92
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,116
              I beg your pardon.

93
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,051
    Come on. Don't tell me      
       you don't think          

94
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,953
       that their heads         
      look like giant..         

95
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,054
                    ( crashing )

96
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,857
I'm sorry, but...               

97
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,759
is there a problem?             

98
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,729
      No, sir butler of         
the esteemed High Gnee council. 

99
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,631
      My companion is, uh,      

100
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,765
            hungry.             

101
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,600
 May I?                         

102
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,302
Oh, please.                     

103
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,204
We Gnees like                   
big buffets,                    

104
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,807
so feel free to take            
a big, juicy bite               

105
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:39,645

106
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,247
          Pressed ham.          

107
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,584
       Hot buttered buns.       

108
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,253
          Moon cakes.           

109
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,156
        Roasted halibut.        

110
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,593
   Sparkling blopberry fizz.

      ( needle scratches )      

112

     Bottomless, of course.     

113
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,633
    And last but not least,     

114
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,673
      our galaxy famous         
        pu-pu platter.          

115
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,444
A thousand pardons, sir butler  
  of the High Gnee council.     

116
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,446
   We must go do that thing     
  with the thing real quick.    

117
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,915
( guffawing )                   

118
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,818
Pu-pu platter?!                 

119
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,754
( gasping )                     

120
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,423
Okay.                           

121
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,825
 ( laughter resumes )           

122
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,261
 Pressed ham!                   

123
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,497
 Buttered buns!                 

124
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,434
 ( raucous laughter )           

125
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,936
              Oh!               

126
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,971
          ( panting )           

127
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,506
 Ah, butts.                     

128
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,275
              BUTLER: Excuse me!

129
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:48,046
          Did I hear someone... 
                      laughing? 

130
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,381
                      ( coughs )

131
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,049
 You!                           

132
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:56,021
Is there something funny        
you'd care to share with us?    

133
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,856
            Me? No, no, no, no. 
                        No way. 

134
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,292
            Why, I'd never even 
              dream of laughing 

135
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,494
               at such a solemn 
          occasion, sir butler, 

136
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,996
             who looks not even 
                a little funny. 

137
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,866
           Guards!              
        Out with him!           

138
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,735
      Don't kick me out.        
     I'm way more worthy        

139
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,970
      than any of these         
       bottom feeders.          

140
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,472
          - Please!             
       - ( door slams )         

141
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:17,209
                  I can't stand 
                  brown-nosing. 

142
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,315
                 ( gong sounds )

143
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,683
This is it.                     

144
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,251
 Just keep your cool.           

145
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,886
      Try thinking sad thoughts.

146
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,755
     An old man dropping        
      an ice cream cone.        

147
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,924
                   Acid rain at 
               Hater's wedding. 
                       Mondays. 

148
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,693
     Greetings, solicitors.     

149
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,062
                  I am Gluteus, 
        the High Gnee council's 

150
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,264
        - number two.           
         - A bee with           
      a pollen allergy.         

151
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,900
              A dog waiting for 
       his master to come home, 

152
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,236
          only to discover he's 
    been sucked through a black 
          hole never to return. 

153
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,037
   In a matter of moments,      
       I shall lead you         

154
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,707
        into the rear           
        of the temple,          

155
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,942
     where you will make        
        your requests.          

156
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,878
  We apologize for the delay.   

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,547
   But the Council has been     
     terribly backed up.        

158
00:06:55,549 --> 00:07:00,085
    They've been stuck on       
    their thrones all day,      

159
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,887
    and they're positively      
           pooped.              

160
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,055
  Baby with a broken rattle,    
  baby with a broken rattle.    

161
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,223
            Wander!             

162
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,058
I'm sorry, Syl.                 

163
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,093
I'm really trying hard,         

164
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,295
but these giggles               
have got a hold on me,          

165
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,197
 and they won't let go.         

166
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,567
              Wow. I am so, so, 
                so unbelievably 

167
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,936
                disappointed in 
                   you, Wander. 

168
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,138
    We finally got a shot       
    at stopping Dominator,      

169
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,040
               and you're about 
                    to blow it. 

170
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,810
Sylvia, do you really           
think that the High Gnees       

171
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,778
are that uptight                
and serious?                    

172
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,581
          ( crying )            
     I don't understand.        

173
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,950
We did everything               
perfectly.                      

174
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,653
     Heel toe, heel toe,        
       dip, turn, turn.         

175
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,322
         We're doomed.          

176
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,758
       Wow, you're right.       

177
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,226
       If we don't get          
 the help of the High Gnees,    

178
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,329
    then Dominator's gonna      
     destroy the galaxy,        

179
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,064
     and there is nothing       
      funny about that.         

180
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,933
      Really? You mean it?      

181
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,802
 You're not gonna go in there   
   and laugh your butt off,     

182
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,138
    and totally bum me out?     

183
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,307
               You're behind me 
                   all the way? 

184
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,009
I can trust you to              
stay serious until              
the very end?                   

185
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,979
               No buts about it?

186
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,248
       From the bottom          
        of your heart?          

187
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,084
GLUTEUS: The High Gnee council  
         will now see           

188
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,820
       Wander and Sylvia.       

189
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,193
        I present to you        

190
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,163
     the High Gnee council.     

191
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,199
    Bow in the presence of      
          the mighty            

192
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,935
         Rear Admiral           
    Keister von Derrière,       

193
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,704
    Grand Vizier Buh'oo Tay,    

194
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,839
         Shakaya Rump           
       the money maker,         

195
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,475
  the twins, Badonk and Adonk,  

196
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:35,180
   and last but not least,      
    Princess Buttforaface.      

197
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,723
     You may now present        
     your pleas for aid.        

198
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,041
              ( light applause )

199
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,676
              ( clears throat ) 
                     Thank you. 

200
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,545
                 Thank you upon 
                   thank you's. 

201
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,247
      - O magnificent--         
         - Pardon me.           

202
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,751
     I am quite stopped up.     

203
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,254
     ( loud farting sound )     

204
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,770
       ( loud raucous laughter )

205
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,343
     Oh, man, I can't...        
         Rump roast!            

206
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,212
        And... and...           
         ( laughing )           

207
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,448
       ( both laughing          
        hysterically )          

208
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,020
      ( council members         
          laughing )            

209
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,692
        It's about time.        

210
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,928
      - Someone finally         
       passed the test.         
   - ( laughter continues )     

211
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,263
                      Test?     

212
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,131
      Do you really think       

213
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,634
      a bunch of people         
     with heads like ours       

214
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,770
    would call themselves       
       the High Gnees?          

215
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,372
   What does that even mean?    

216
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:11,142
   The looks on your faces      
     are just priceless.        

217
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,478
( giggling )                    
Buns.                           

218
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,781
    Hold it. You did this       
   for what reason exactly?     

219
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,084
          ( laughing )          

220
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,720
   Anyone who doesn't laugh     
       is either lying          

221
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,888
    or not paying attention.    

222
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,592
    We are sick and tired       
   of people kissing our...     

223
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,294
         ( laughing )           
           faces...             

224
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,629
      just to get a favor.      

225
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,231
       You're the first         
        honest people           

226
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,266
      we've met in years.       

227
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,436
Can you imagine                 
someone named Gluteus?          

228
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,573
          ( laughter )          

229
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,742
 My real name's Todd.           

230
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,644
             Todd.              

231
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:50,448
     To help you overcome       
 even the greatest obstacle,    

232
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,285
         we offer you           
    this piece of wisdom.       

233
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,955
          Lighten up!!          

234
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,759
  The darkest times call for    
   the sunniest of smiles.      

235
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,994
          ( laughter )          

236
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,829
              Wow. Thank you.   

237
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,798
        It has been a long time 
              since I've really 

238
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,967
                laughed my...   

239
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,169
Sylvia, that's                  
just crude.                     

240
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,338
      ( toilet flushing )       

241
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,349
       I get that space         
      is quiet and all,         

242
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,218
        but this place          
  gives me the willies. Ugh!    

243
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,955
This place                      
is amazing!                     

244
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,826
  Just think of the stories     
    this old time-y orbble      
     station could tell.        

245
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,529
           I'd rather you focus 
                 on the present 

246
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,364
       and help us get          
         outta here.            

247
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,232
        Totally out of          
        orbble juice.           

248
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,767
                   I'll go pay, 
                   you fuel up. 

249
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,408
       "The Wright Place.       

250
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,378
  Orbble and Wilmur Wright,     
         proprietors.           

251
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,848
    Traverse the universe       
     one step at a time."       

252
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,750
             Whoa!              

253
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,585
   That took no time at all.    

254
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,021
    Well, Orbble, Wilmur,       
          thanks for            

255
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,256
   fueling the adventures,      
           friends.             

256
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,592
             Weird. Nobody here.

257
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,394
           I left a few credits 
                on the counter. 

258
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,363
      Come on, pal, let's ditch 
               this ghost town. 

259
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,566
Bye, Wright Place.              
Wish I knew you when.           

260
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,568
          Ah, forget that place.

261
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,570
           We got lots of other 
                 things to see. 

262
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,272
  Supernovas, astral rings,     
   a galactic conjunction.      

263
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,274
    A galactic conjunction?!    

264
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,378
       That shouldn't be        
       happening again for      
       another thousand years.  

265
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,047
 Whoa, Syl, look.               

266
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,482
There's Lord Hater!             

267
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,351
 And Emperor Awesome.           

268
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,354
            And me!             

269
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,923
Lord Hater,                     
is that you?                    

270
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,126
          Oh, it's me!          

271
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,194
            Hi, me!             

272
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,203
            Wander?             

273
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,873
Hold on. Things just            
got interesting.                

274
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,276
    I even packed a picnic!     

275
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,080
       Did you get time orbbles?

276
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:05,483
Did I? There were two pumps     
not clearly labeled,            
I might add.                    

277
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,485
It's possible that              
I may have.                     

278
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,487
Is it the past?                 

279
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,389
'Cause we're coming up          
on my favorite part.            

280
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,725
  ( straining )                 

281
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,332
     I'm gonna go help me       
     pass out sandwiches.       

282
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,774
You can't just go               
over there and help yourself.   

283
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,443
With time orbbles,              
there are paradoxes             
and time shifts,                

284
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,113
and that stupid                 
butterfly effect.               

285
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,648
               Ooh, butterflies.

286
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,750
Seriously, if we change         
something in our past,          

287
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,485
it could affect our future,     

288
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,487
which is our present            
in the future...                

289
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,788
Oh, I hate time travel!         

290
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,791
     We just have to get        
   back to the Wright place     

291
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,159
       at the right time,       

292
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,128
     to the exact moment        
           we left,             

293

     and get regular old

294
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,966
       Stop. We're here.        

295
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,401

you're having fun reminiscing,  

306
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,561
              but we can't just 
                 waste our time 

307
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,730
    watching past episodes      
        of our lives.           

308
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,565
          It could be dangerous.

309
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,033
          And boring.           

310
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,837
We only have enough             
juice for a few more orbbles.   

311

When our time runs out,         
our time runs out,              

312
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,141
and we'll be stuck              
wherever we are,                

313
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,444

work with me on this?           

314
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,584
        Okay, well...           
  this event just happened,     

315
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,586
      so we can't be far        
   from the orbble station.     

316
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,556
  Just a bit further forward.   

317
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,558
Further forward.                
Got it.                         

318
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,426
               What? Slow down! 
                          Stop! 

319
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,099
   Where are we?                

320
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,333
               When are we?     

321
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,768
          ( growling )          

322
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,707
       We have to save          
         Lord Hater.            

323
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,409
Wander, this must               
be the future.                  

324
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,511
We can't interfere now.         

325
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,846
We'll have to save him          
later when the time comes.      

326
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,681
            But the time is now.

327
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,416
Not yet it's not.               

328
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,451
We'll make a note               
of this moment,                 

329
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,853
and come back                   
when the time is right.         

330
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,721
Okay, buddy?                    
We just gotta get back.         

331
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,491
       Gotta get back?          
      Back to the past.         

332
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,427
          Wander, no!           

333
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,596
      Okay, I don't have        
        much to go on.          

334
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,564
         Just my gut,           
    a sneaking suspicion,       

335
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,099
  and a quick eye for detail,   

336
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:39,037
     but I think we were        
      right about here.         

337
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,441
                     Uh, Wander.

338
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:49,480
       You're too late,         
      Admiral Admirable.        

339
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,720
FYI: I knew about this pyramid  
  before it became a thing.     

340
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,722
               Another galactic 
                   conjunction? 

341
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,657
                  This can't be 
            the future, can it? 

342
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,460
Nope, this is the past.         
A <i> long </i> time ago,              

343
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,563
in a galaxy far, far,           
far away.                       

344
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,299
Adjacent to the one             
we're in now, or then.          

345
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,667
 I'm really confused.           

346
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,769
     - Ooh, time travel!        
           - Look!              

347
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,672
Major Threat,                   
is that you?                    

348
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,841
            Wander, is that you?

349
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,077
 It's me, Tumbleweed.           

350
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,180
Are you here to watch           
the planets align, too?         

351
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,483
Look, I even packed             
a picnic!                       

352
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,285
                   Tumbleweed?  

353
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,786
Folks in this galaxy            
call me Tumbleweed.             

354
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,121
Who am I to say                 
what's what?                    

355
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,156
        You are a man           
    of mystery, my friend.      

356
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,192
    You remember me, right      
         Tumbleweed.            

357
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:38,196
     I travel the galaxy,       
     I'm about this tall,       

358
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,766
  wear a hat, and sometimes,    
      I make this face.         

359
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,868
             You do this a lot, 
                     don't you? 

360
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,204
Whatever it takes               
to find the good in the bad.    

361
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,278
                        Oh, no. 
                No, no, no, no. 
                      Not here. 

362
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,847
What's wrong?                   
When are we?                    

363
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,282
            Back off, KL-Bot 85.

364
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,951
              This is my bounty.

365
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,722
                 Never hurts to 
              help... yourself. 

366
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,392
           Come on,             
    you wandering weirdo.       

367
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,061
              Wander. Huh.      

368
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,796
       I like the sound of that.

369
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,699
 What's wrong, Syl?             

370
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,601
I knew you were                 
a bad guy; I was there.         

371
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,103
                  Yeah, but I'd 
              rather forget it. 

372
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,372
     I've come a long way       
         since then.            

373
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,174
      I don't wanna live        
         in the past.           

374
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,109
      I just wanna keep         
       moving forward.          

375
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,745
Oh, no.                         

376
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,747
 Our last orbble.               

377
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,016
     If we don't get back       
   to the orbble station...     

378
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,584
  Then we're stuck wherever     
         and whenever           

379
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,586
        the orbble pops.        

380
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,154
                 Let's do this. 
               No time to lose. 

381
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,800
   BOTH: No, no, no, no, no.    

382
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,504
     No, no, no, no, no,        
          no, no...             

383
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,475
   WANDER: The end of time.     
           Too far!             

384
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,717
SYLVIA: The beginning of time.  
           Too far!             

385
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,687
         We're here.            
         The station.           

386
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,558
    Hello, weary travelers.     

387
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,927
     I'm Orbble, and this       
    is my brother Wilmur,       

388
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,929
                 and you are at 
              the Wright place. 

389
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,799
            - Yep.              
     - At the wrong time!       

390
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,235
           Say, friends, can we 
             tempt you with our 
           brand-new invention? 

391
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,504
         The orbble transporter.

392
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,806
          Traverse the universe 
            one step at a time. 

393
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,640
              Yep.              

394
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,775
Orbbles. Perfect.               

395
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,644
We'll take some                 
time orbbles.                   

396
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,846
       So we can return         
       to the present.          

397
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,748
                  Time orbbles. 
          Never heard of those. 

398
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,483
        - Eh, Wilmur?           
           - Nope.              

399
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,319
        - Sounds like           
    a bang-up idea though.      
            - Yep.              

400
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,855
              We'll get to work 
          on 'em straight away. 

401
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,658
          - Really?             
            - Yep.              
      - Should have 'em         
         figured out            

402
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,993
      - in about five--         
            - No.               

403
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,061
        - Fifty years.          
            - Yep.              

404
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,198
We're stuck here.               

405
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,533
                We're not stuck.

406
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,368
       We can travel the galaxy 
             like we always do. 

407
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,203
                  We'll just be 
           ahead of the trends. 

408
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,773
We can't because                
the paradox                     

409
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,175
 of the space-time continuum... 

410
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,676
 Butterflies.                   

411
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,711
 We have to stay put.           

412
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,713
              Ugh, time travel!!

413
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,183
                Sylvia, this is 
                  all my fault. 

414
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,818
             I was so caught up 
          in living in the past 

415
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,154
       that I ruined our future.

416
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,889
 You didn't, buddy.             

417
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,524
You know what                   
would ruin our future?          

418
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,725
Feeling sorry                   
for ourselves,                  

419
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,961
and not living                  
in the present.                 

420
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,529
 Hey, fellas,                   

421
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,198
how about we run                
the station                     

422
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,067
while you hurry up              
and focus on those              
time orbbles?                   

423
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,703
          Fifty years are gonna 
                  fly right by. 

424
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,682
    Wander, today's the day.    

425
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,817
          ( snoring )           

426
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,254
    WANDER: Today's the day!    

427
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,325
         Hurry, Wander.         

428
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:30,661
      I'm going as fast         
          as I can.             

429
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,843
I get that space                
is quiet and all,               

430
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,180
but this place                  
gives me the willies. Ugh.      

431
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,683
 This place is amazing!         

432
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:56,587
     Just think of the stories  
     this old-time-y orbble     
     station can tell.          

433
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,690
           I'd rather you focus 
                 on the present 

434
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,225
                    and help us 
                get outta here. 

435
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,927
           We're totally out of 
                  orbble juice. 

436
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,962
                   I'll go pay, 
                   you fuel up. 

437
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,770
         Out of order?          

438
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,372
      Huh. Time orbbles?!       

439
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,874
       Whoo, close call.        

440
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,818
( sighs happily )               
We did it, Syl old girl.        

441
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,554
They bought regular             
old orbbles.                    

442
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,257
   We closed the time loop      
so none of this ever happened.  

443
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:37,061
Sorry we had to waste           
our time waiting here.          

444
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:41,332
Not a waste of time if I got to 
   spend it with you, pal.      

445
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,936
I almost bought                 
time orbbles.                   

446
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,805

447
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,474

        a whole thing.          

448
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,815
         ( straining )

00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,817
                        SYLVIA: 
       How long are we gonna...

00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,253
WANDER: Sh! This
