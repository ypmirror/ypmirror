  but, please, don't take       
  matters into your own hands.

       Right, yeah, I...        

287
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,168
     I suppose that works.

that little bird man?

        You know, you might     
        want to take this       
        a little more seriously.

293
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,416
    Oh, sorry. You're right.

such a long time                

296
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,323
since I've seen my daughter.    

297

             Yes, but this isn't
             a rebellious teen.

          beyond your reach now.

   Well, of course we'll try.   

302
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,169
     It just won't be easy.     

303
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,705
    Even the little monsters    
    can be a handful.           

304
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,540
           Now let's keep going.

You said she had a tail?

     A tail, which she used

             something about it!

          Let's get out of here.

      to find my daughter

             -No.               

344
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,636
      Well, that's              
      a confusing answer.       

345
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,571
     But we'll go with yes.     

346

    I've been tracking the beast
    for quite a while now.

           of her mother! Ha ha!

349
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,580

most of the credit.

00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,115
         Can you take us to her?

351
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,750
Well, that depends.             

352
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,619
       Do you have legs?

        Is this the bog?        

359
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,966
Well, it was the bog,           

360
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,834
till that beast                 
drank it up.

00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,474
on account of her               
drinking the bog.               

364
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,077
                 How big is she?

365
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,479
     Well, I must say,          
     as a Bog Beast expert,     

366
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,181
    I reckon she's this big.

         Not this big!

 I mean, this is just her foot.

          A footprint!          

370
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,520
      But, yes, she's big!

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,701
          Well, if you          
          drank a bog, you'd put
          on a few pounds, love.

376
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,803
But what is she eating?         

377
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,205
  Ooh! I can answer that one.   

378
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,441
    [dramatic music playing]    

379
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,944
    She's been eating           
    the souls of my family.     

380
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,213
At first, I thought I'd         
quite like the peace and quiet, 

381
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,481
but then I, uh...               

382
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,516
I realized I-I do--             
I do miss them.                 

383
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,451
                 Except for Tim.

384
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,653
              I do not miss Tim!
              Thanks, Tim!      
              You're gone!      

385
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,821
           Oh, dear.            

386
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,723
     How is she doing that?     

387
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,558
  -Well, her tracks end here.   
  -[light snoring]              

388
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,693
       She must be close.       

389
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,362
     Let's try to find her.     

390
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,397
                [hushed]        
                Eddie, no! Stop!

391
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,631
       -Get out of there!       
       -No!                     

392
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,134
       Wow! She's bigger        
       than I thought!          

393
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,136
       You ought to come        
       look at this!            

394
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,338
   -[hushed] No, no, no!        
   -Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! No!    

395
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,739
    [Eddie] I think I better    
    give her a nudge.           

396
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,341
       See if we can            
       wake her up a bit.       

397
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,477
         Nudge, nudge!          

398
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,613
      Yep, I think              
      that that's worked.       

399
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,519
    [dramatic music playing]    

400
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,092
              Oh!               

401
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,761
[gasping]                       
She... has... magic.            

402
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,729
                         Mm-hmm.

403
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,230
We have to stop her.            

404
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,932
        Wait. You have          
        to let me try something.

405
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,033
What?                           

406
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,101
         She might listen to me.

407
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,202
What?!                          

408
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,871
           [hushed]             
           Come back!           

409
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,773
       [exasperated sigh]       

410
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,076
Hello there.                    

411
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,444
Oh! [stammering]                

412
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,212
Before you kill me,             

413
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,481
I-- I brought you               
something.                      

414
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,018
             Bo-Bo!             

415
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,121
          Is it really... Bo-Bo?

416
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,023
[whimpering]                    
Up we go!                       

417
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,257
               Can't believe it!

418
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,792
                  It's really...

419
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,895
        Yes! It's Bo-Bo!        

420
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,263
        What's a Bo-Bo?         

421
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,800
            But Mama made Bo-Bo.

422
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,037
          Are you my... my mama?

423
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,239
   You know,                    
   I think I prefer "Mother."   

424
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,807
                          What?!

425
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,643
 You know, "Mama" is just fine. 

426
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,912
    What should I call you?     

427
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,982
                    Baby Smooth.

428
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,219
            Okaaaay.            

429
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,787
                 [sighing laugh]

430
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,389
            Mama?               
            Where have you been?

431
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,625
            Well...             

432
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,327
        some terrible,          
        terrible people         

433
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,763
     locked me up               
     in a dingy old crystal     

434
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,799
deep down                       
in a dark dungeon.              

435
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,602
They were a rather backwards,   
maladjusted people,             

436
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,904
especially their old queen.     

437
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,172
              Oh!               

438
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,674
But that is an era bygone,      

439
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,310
and I'm hoping that now         
we're together again,           

440
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,780
we're going to have everything  
we've ever missed out on.       

441
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,415
                      Like what?

442
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,950
         I don't know.          

443
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,486
     Uh, how about ponies?      

444
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,522
      Bedtimes past 8:00.       

445
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,923
    Ice cream for breakfast.    

446
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,324
               I hate ice cream.

447
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,859
Then no ice cream.              

448
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,995
What would you like instead?    

449
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,330
You can have                    
anything you want.              

450
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,833
            The throne of Mewni.

451
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,101
             What?              

452
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,870
      I'm afraid                
      that's not possible.      

453
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,173
         [heavy thuds]          

454
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,976
             You said I can have
             anything I want.   

455
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,280
But the throne                  
is not mine to give.            

456
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,882
             It's ours by right!

457
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,051
A lot has changed               
since we've been gone,          

458
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,687
and after everything            
that's happened                 
at St Olga's...                 

459
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,988
          I was                 
          a great head mistress!

460
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,891
But you were stealing           
the life-force                  

461
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,993
of those girls                  
to preserve your youth.         

462
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,796
        Oh, you noticed.        

463
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,699
 Look, we have each other now.  

464
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,634
  You don't need this kingdom.  

465
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,236
               Are you saying...

466
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,571
              no?!              

467
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:34,738
           [inhales]            

468
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,840
           Yes, I am.           

469
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,809
          -Ugh!                 
          -[stomping]           

470
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,045
Young lady, you turn            
right back around!              

471
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,880
     All right, that's it!      

472
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,048
Meteora!                        

473
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,684
       You have to stop!

            [gasps]             

475
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,026
            Mama, you set me up!

476
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,031
       I don't want to hurt you!

477
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,468
That's too bad, because         
that's all I want to do to you! 

478
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,238
         [groans] Yah!          

479
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:10,775
              Ah!

00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,223
                     I love you!

484
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,393
       I know you haven't       
       heard these words        

485
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,029
      in a very long time,      
      but I'm saying them       
      again to you now.         

486
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,832
        Please, Meteora,        
        come back to me.        

487
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,468
             I-I...

              Aah!              

490
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,818
       I am ending this.        

491
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,253
              No!
