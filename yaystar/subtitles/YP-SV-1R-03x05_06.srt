Marco, we're late for school.

00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,805
        - I'm not Marco.

26
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,946
          Oh. Oh, no.           
      The High Commission.      

27
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,849
Leave it.                       
There's no time.                

28
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,955

      Escape route blast!       

30
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,607
     Magic is not supposed      
          to do that.           

31
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,275
          I'm not sure          
         what that was.         

32
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,579
      But my magic's gone.      

33
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,314
            - Rats.             
       - It will be okay.       

34
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,783
                  No, rats.     
                  We gotta hide.

          - Star, no.           

36
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,229
      Mom, you can't take       
            my wand.            

37
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,830
       It was mine first.       

38
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,299
No more magic until             
we find a way to stop this.     

39
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,168
               I've got an idea.

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,972
                Let's go destroy
                    Toffee.     

41
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,007
                   Come on, Mom,
                  let's just go.

42
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,009
      - Let's go kill him.      
          - Star, no.           

43
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,111
          Well, then,           
     what's the plan, Mom?      

44
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,846
                  'Cause I ain't
                  seein' one.   

45
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,681
Oh, Star.                       

46
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,650
I don't have                    
a plan.                         

47
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,118
I'm just trying                 
to keep you safe, okay?         

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,921
             Okay.              

49
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,689
   Well, can't stay out here.   

50
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,659
          It's creepy.          

51
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,427
            We need             
     another hiding place.      

52
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,862
                         Ribbit.

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,667
            Ribbit.             

54
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,770
           ( gasps )            
            Ribbit.             

55
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,873
     I think I have an idea     
        where we can go.        

56
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,642
   But you have to trust me.    

57
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,014
        Buffrog!                

58
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,716
        Star Butterfly!         

59
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,186
  Oh, my little sweet potato.   
      It's been too long.       

60
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,620
QUEEN MOON: Ahem.               

61
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,723
        Oh, Queen Moon.         

62
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,725
        Greetings.              

63
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,727
             Mom, this is       
             Yvgeny Bulgoyaboff.

64
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,497
  Please, call me               
  Buffrog.                      

65
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,732
    - He used to work for       
    Ludo, but he's cool now.    
    - What?!                    

66
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,335
            Hey, Buffrog, can we
            crash with you      
            for a night?        

67
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,305
Of course. I owe you            
for all that tadpole-sitting.   

68
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,307
Star, can I                     
speak with you?                 

69
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,510
We cannot                       
stay with him.                  
He's a monster.                 

70
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:35,480
       Mom, get with the times. 
       Not all monsters are bad.

71
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,115
        - ( twig snaps )        
        - What was that?        

72
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,922
Well, it seems we have          
no other choice.                

73
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,925
            Uh, welcome to my...

74
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,927
                      home.     

75
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,762
             Boop.              

76
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,365
You're in luck.                 

77
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,167
It's rainy season.              

78
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,503
          Ah, so good           
         for the skin.          

79
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,372
   Oh, uh, no shoes in house.   

80
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,908
              I am, how you say,
              germophobe.       

81
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,947
                 I feel so free.

82
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,216
    Buffrog, wonderful home.    

83
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,018
         Oh, thank you.         

84
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,586
       Is a bit of a mess       
           right now.           

85
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,421
             Please take a seat.

86
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,357
        Oh! Are those...        

87
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,125
slugs?                          

88
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,961
           Slugs keep           
        furniture clean.        

89
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,963
       I thought everyone       
           knew that.           

90
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,131
          I'll stand.           

91
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,368
          Yo, Buffrog,          
     where them babies at?      

92
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,371
      Oh, I just put them       
         down for nap.          

93
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,872
            Babies!             

94
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:38,644
   ( laughing ) Oh, I missed    
 you little baby faces so much. 

95
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,580
          Oh, my gosh,          
   you have little baby arms!   

96
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,583
        Yes, all except         
        little Katrina.         

97
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,618
                   She is       
                   late bloomer.

98
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,954
     Oh, you little special     
           snowflake.           

99
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,957
            Babies, say hello to
            Queen Butterfly.    

100
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,659
That really isn't--             

101
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,260
       ( all ribbiting )        

102
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,230
       Star, I have been        
     so worried about you.      

103
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,631
         Why? I'm good.         

104
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,633
        Well, when Ludo         
       took your castle,        

105
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,402
     I thought, you know...     

106
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,237
    ( makes slicing sound )     

107
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,839
Whoa, wait.                     
Toffee has our castle?          

108
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,108
                 Toffee is dead.
                 Ludo in castle.

109
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,010
     Ugh! Toffee not dead.      

110
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,912
      Toffee inside Ludo.       

111
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,515
           Oh, I see.           
           So creepy.           

112
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,917
               Papa! Dad's still
               in the castle!   

113
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,018
         We have to go save him.

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,853
       No.                      

115
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,255
           ( gasps )            

116
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,824
      He is your husband!       

117
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,759
        Star, I've made         
          my decision.          

118
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,127
         We stay here.          

119
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,296
           Excuse me.           
    Where is your wash room?    

120
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,198
         Uh, wash room?         

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,300
        Yes. I'd like to        
       freshen up a bit.        

122
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,668
She needs to                    
make boom-boom.                 

123
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,004
       Oh! The wash room        

124
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,573
         - is out back.         
         - Thank you.           

125
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,444
I'm sorry.                      
My mom's got...                 

126
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,878
monster issues.                 

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,882
        Yes, I'm getting        
     certain vibe from her.     

128
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,818
       Yeah, we all are.        

129
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,053
    But Buffrog, I came here    
          for a favor.          

130
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,489
           Of course.           
       Anything for you.        

131
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,057
I need you to                   
hang out with my mom.           

132
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,992
I need you to                   
keep her busy                   
while I go find Toffee.         

133
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,695
               Star, Toffee     
            is very dangerous.  

134
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,731
               Do you have plan?

135
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,066
         - I have plan.         
        - You have plan?        

136
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,035
          I have plan.          

137
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,671
        Okay. When Moon returns,

138
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,539
            I will distract her.

139
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,141
                     Distract me
                     from what? 

140
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,043
         Uh, from this.         

141
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,879
       I didn't want you        

142
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,080
                    to see it.  

143
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:23,482
            Bad choices in past.

144
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,350
         Oh. Thank you.         

145
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:28,754
         So what do you monsters
         do for entertainment?  

146
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,256
        Uh, we could smash bugs.

147
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,991
   We could play board game.    

148
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,093
Great idea, Buffrog.            

149
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,429
      And I will hang out       
        with the babies         

150
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,731
         in their room.         

151
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,369
Your daughter                   
is very strange.                

152
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,905
                      Thank you.

153
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,940
      We have many option       
         of board game.         

154
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,977
       ( reading titles )       

155
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,349
      Monster Conquerors,       
        Castle Crushers,        

156
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,585
        Kill the Queen,         
     Mewman Versus Monster,     

157
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,055
        or my favorite,         
        Puddle Defender.        

158
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,191
Mmm, interesting.               

159
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,193
    I like babushka monster.    

160
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,129
       I don't know why,        
   but I'm drawn to this one.   

161
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,366
       Okay, the rules of       
      Puddle Defender are,      

162
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:15,934
             uh...              

163
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,235
             Um...              

164
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,805
        the rules are...        

165
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,039
              Yes?              

166
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,375
           Uh, rules are simple.

167
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,977
 The evil bloodthirsty Mewman,  
          that's you,           

168
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,614
must try and sneak past watchful
   Monster parent, that's me.   

169
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,151
      Break into daycare,       
explode helpless monster babies,

170
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,253
              and turn them into
              stew for eating.  

171
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,088
           ( gasps )            
       That is horrible!        

172
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,391
       ( snapping sound )       

173
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,092
              Hey, here is dice!

174
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,994
                 You roll first.

175
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,063
       QUEEN MOON: Seven.       
     One, two, three, four,     

176
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,165
       five, six, seven.        

177
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,934
    "You are filthy Mewman.     

178
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,303
   Use teeth-sharpening spell   

179
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,139
      for better eating of      
    monster babies." Really?    

180
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,440
                    Is this fun?

181
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,342
        Who will get to         
         daycare first?         

182
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,778
         Suspense is killing me.

183
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,746
       "Congratulations."       
              Oh.               

184
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,316
     "You set a Mewman camp     
            on fire.            

185
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,318
    Collect four corn pieces    
          from bank."           

186
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,552
            Come on.            

187
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,523
                 Oh, you land in
                 mud puddle.    

188
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,458
        You get nothing.        
          Tough break.          

189
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,760
        This game seems         
         a tad biased.          

190
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,195
    Really? I never noticed.    

191
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,498
     Yay! I get more corn.      

192
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,433
          ( coughing )          

193
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,204
    Did you hear something?     

194
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,439
        I hear nothing.         

195
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,509
    You know, it's monsters     
    that eat Mewman babies.     

196
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,143
          Oh, really?           

197
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,946
      Can you name a time       

198
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,148
       when monsters have       
    ever done such a thing?     

199
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,151
         Well, no, but          
      when I was a child,       

200
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,320
    we played a game called     
        Castle Defender         

201
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:46,057
  about Mewmans protecting our  
 babies from ravenous monsters. 

202
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,159
         That idea had          
    to come from somewhere.     

203
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:52,030
       Because it was in        
    a children's board game?    

204
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,065
   I just think that monsters   
would have less of a reputation 

205
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,701
       if they didn't act       
 so bloodthirsty all the time.  

206
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,470
   Monsters only act that way   

207
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,705
           to protect           
   their babies from Mewmans.   

208
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,507
    You may not understand,     

209
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,709
      but monsters will do      
   anything for our children.   

210
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,379
     Don't talk to me about     
    what I'm willing to do.     

211
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,214
        Why do you think        
    I'm here in this swamp?     

212
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,216
  To protect Star from Toffee!  

213
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,919
 Don't you think I'm worried to 
    death about my husband?     

214
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,821
  But I have to keep my child   
       safe at all costs!       

215
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,057
     Something you probably     
      wouldn't understand,      

216
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,326
   because you're a monster.    

217
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,729
         You insult me,         
          Queen Moon.           

218
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,767
         My buffbabies,         
       they are my life.        

219
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,004
        And that is why,        
       Star Butterfly...        

220
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,774
                I will not      
                help you escape.

221
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,175
            - Star!             
           - Buffrog!           

222
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,244
         Star will be safe here.

223
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,218
                Keeps babies in,
                and dangers out.

224
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,887
I should have                   
realized.                       

225
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,923
But of course.                  
You're a parent, too.           

226
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,092
        I can't believe         
    you're taking her side.     

227
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,428
     BOTH: Go to your room!     

228
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,098
        - ( door slams )        
            - Kids.             

229
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,367
        Scared ol' mama.        

230
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,868
      Two-timing Buffrog.       

231
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,437
    What's their plan, huh?     

232
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,305
    Just avoid your problems    
           to death.            

233
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,074
          Great plan.           
     It's a terrible plan.      

234
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,276
        I've got plans.         
      I've got big plans.       

235
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,211
     But no, they stuck me      
            in here.            

236
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,281
We can help you.                

237
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,782
     Not now. I'm thinking.     
         Who said that?         

238
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,150
      It was me, Katrina.       

239
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,386
      You guys can talk?!       

240
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,121
        Just me so far.         

241
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,456
   I haven't told my dad yet.   

242
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,625
     There's something else     
      I haven't told him.       

243
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,397
                 Holy moley!    

244
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,132
       Sometimes we gotta       
     sneak out to the club      

245
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,668
       - and go dancing.        
       - I feel ya, girl.       

246
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,403
           All clear.           

247
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,673
Wow. We made it.                

248
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:45,276
   - So what's the big plan?    
          - What plan?          

249
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,345
          The plan for          
        beating Toffee?         

250
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,148
           Oh, right.           

251
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,182
       I don't have one.        

252
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,984
             What?              

253
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,586
        Yeah, planning's        
      not really my thing.      

254
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,321
    I kinda just go for it.     

255
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,324
    That is a terrible plan.    

256
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,292
           Oh, my precious      
           little ribbit babies.

257
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,360
                Don't you worry.

258
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,862
       I'm very worried.        

259
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,698
          I'll see you          
    after I destroy Toffee.     

260
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,704
   She's gonna die.             

261
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,442
Get it out,                     
all of it!                      

262
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,344
This is my castle.              
I don't want to see             

263
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,447
a single Butterfly face.        
Move it!                        

264
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,354
       Wait, wait, wait.        
   What am I looking at here?   

265
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,259
           No Butterflies.      
           Get that out of here.

266
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,230
Is that the last                
of it?                          

267
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,367
   And with that, everything    
   in my kingdom is in order.   

268
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,204
         Corncobs here.         
       Get your corncobs.       

269
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,206
              No, no, not again!

270
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,744
        These rats have eaten me
        out of house and home.  

271
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,746
   Right, they will do that.    

272
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,381
       Okay, a few kinks        
          to work out,          

273
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,316
   but overall, the citizens    
       of Mewni love me.        

274
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,051
       Hey, merch vendor,       

275
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,920
           how are the King Ludo
           T-shirts selling?    

276
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,923
          Very, very,           
         very not good.         

277
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,391
        Not good at all,        
         Your Majesty.          

278
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,026
     What about the masks?      

279
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,395
       Those especially.        
      Here, I'll show you.      

280
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,363
Greetings,                      
young man.                      

281
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,266
Might I interest you            
in a King Ludo mask?            

282
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,769
        - ( shrieking )         
       - Run, baby, run!        

283
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,437
     Maybe it's the beard.      

284
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,906
     No, my lord, they just     
        don't like you.         

285
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,708
           Oh, honey, look at   
           all that great stuff.

286
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,610
    Wow, we should load up.     

287
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,012
            Finally,            
      someone with taste.       

288
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,115
         Let me just...         

289
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,416
      This will look great      
         in our foyer.          

290
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,251
            How much for        
            this handsome fella?

291
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,853
Oh, well...                     

292
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,454
       It's not for sale.       
            Come on.            

293
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,690
   You know what? That's it.    
           Levitato!            

294
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,428
    There. All that terrible    
    Butterfly stuff is gone.    

295
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,297
     Now, how about a nice      
     King Ludo coffee mug,      

296
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,700
       - or a bobblehead?       
  - We don't want your stuff.   

297
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:52,303
Yeah, we don't                  
like you; nobody                
likes you, dude.                

298
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,471
          See what I'm          
       dealing with here?       

299
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,806
        I am your king.         

300
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,608
   I command you to like me.    

301
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,076
              No.               

302
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,377
      ( frustrated yell )       

303
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,114
         ( straining )          

304
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,482
           Checkmate.           

305
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,485
I'm bad at everything.          

306
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,454
                First rule      
                of chess, Marco:

307
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,723
              you must always   
              protect your king.

308
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,858
       ( keys jingling )        

309
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,296
      - What do you want?       
    - You're coming with me.    

310
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,166
        No way. I'm not         
        going anywhere with you.

311
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,300
        That's too bad.         

312
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,068
It's urgent royal business.     

313
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,405
I need you to command           
the people to like me.          

314
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,642
          ( laughs )            
          Why would I do that?  
          I don't even like you.

315
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,477
        Shuffling about         
        and talking to          
        that wand hand of yours.

316
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,746
             It's weird.        

317
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,149
  Fine. If you won't help me,   
       then you can just        
       rot in this cell.        

318
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,318
          Say good-bye          
        to your freedom.        

319
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,457
            Come on,            
       you stupid chain.        

320
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,859
      Ha ha!                    

321
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,561
    Ho ho. Ludo.                

322
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,064
       Butter.                  

323
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,335
        Change of plan.         

324
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,038
    I'm giving you 24 hours     
      to figure out a way       

325
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,940
       to make the people       
       of Mewni like me,        

326
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,708
           or I'll...           

327
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,945
       I'll levitato you        
     into the sky forever.      

328
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,347
              Oh, I'm so scared.

329
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,015
   Twenty-four hours.           

330
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,452
Dude, Ludo's gone               
completely nuts.                

331
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,954
              You're telling me.

332
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,356
                He left behind  
                a perfectly good
                stick of butter.

333
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,292
                Oh, I can...    
                almost taste it.

334
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,528
  River, now is no time for...  

335
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,563
            butter.             

336
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,867
               Yes, you're      
               young and limber.

337
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,568
          Reach out for it, boy.

338
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,004
                      Excellent!
                      Ha ha!    

339
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,806
             Ha ha!             

340
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,408
             Careful. Save some 
             for the gruel, boy.

341
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,378
       Nice work, Marco.        

342
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,747
Here. Butter yourself up,       
and I'll see if I can           

343
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,349
figure a way out of here.       

344
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,650
                Try the AC vent.

345
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,586
The dungeon has                 
air conditioning?               

346
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,555
          It's a dungeon,       
          not a torture chamber.

347
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,658
      Nice. How are those       
        shackles coming?        

348
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,994
         I don't think          
     this is going to work.     

349
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,930
         River, did you         
     eat the butter, River?     

350
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,232
       I used to be king.       

351
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,568
      Okay, okay, I'll go       
   steal that key from Ludo,    

352
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,036
      and then we'll both       
        get out of here.        

353
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,672
      You should just go.       
     This isn't your fight.     

354
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,976
  Marco, listen to your king.   

355
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,750
    Whoa. The royal bedroom.    

356
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,655
             Ludo.              

357
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,032
             - Sh.              
          - Ruberiot?           

358
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,467
Quiet, dude.                    
You're gonna                    
get us caught.                  

359
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,771
    Whoo, how'd I ever live     
  without a solid gold toilet?  

360
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,973
               What the heck    
               is going on here?

361
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,075
Since Ludo took over,           
we've been hiding in            
the vents.                      

362
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,478
When he's not around,           
we eat his royal leftovers.     

363
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
          And bathe in          
     his royal bubble bath.     

364
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,619
And sleep in                    
his royal bed.                  

365
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,721
She was miming that             
we sleep in his royal bed.      

366
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,823
     LUDO: Those villagers      
       are so ungrateful.       

367
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,792
                  And end scene.

368
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,298
        I don't get it.         

369
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,767
      How are these things      
   not flying off the shelf?    

370
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,137
   It can't be for my lack of   
     devilishly good looks.     

371
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,574
      I've got that whole       
 levitatoing King River to do.  

372
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,379
        Being a king is         
       simply exhausting.       

373
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,118
Now's our chance.               

374
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,153
If we can get                   
that key from Ludo,             
we can free the king and--      

375
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,089
      Whoa. I'm gonna have      
    to stop you right there.    

376
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,924
      You see, as artists,      

377
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,859
     our job is to comment      
    on the world around us,     

378
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,695
       not "doing stuff."       

379
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,164
      A heavy burden, yes,      
    but that's what it means    

380
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,166
       to be an artiste.        

381
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,935
        Oh, please.             
      You, an artist?           

382
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,604
    - You're nothing but        
    a jingle scribbler.         
    - And you're a buffoon.     

383
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,706
The buffoon is merely           
the facade                      

384
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,475
for my pointed                  
social commentary.              

385
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,777
That's what makes me            
a true artist.                  

386
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,612
        Not as much of an artist
        as the mime.            

387
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,415
Obviously. We all know          
the mime is an artistic genius. 

388
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,885
        - BOTH: Genius.         
         - Guys, look.          

389
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,054
   I'm not a soldier either,    
       but there's a time       

390
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,490
      when you have to get      
       off the sidelines        
       and get involved.        

391
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,692
If the four of us               
work together,                  

392
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,627
we can save                     
the true king of Mewni.         

393
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,195
       Now who's with me?       

394
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,365
      Now, see, I wouldn't      
     use that hand gesture.     

395
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,634
         It's just been         
         done to death.         

396
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,236
      And you never want to     
  end a sentence with a pronoun.

397
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,605
                 You all        
              make me sick.     

398
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,817
        No. I don't want        
       to shave the corn.       

399
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,266
               What? Who's here?

400
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,234
               Who's in         
               my royal bedroom?

401
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,235
                A guy in a mask.

402
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,005
We're here to...                

403
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,207
         entertain you,         
            my lord.            

404
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,009
             What?              

405
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,415
In the middle                   
of the night?                   

406
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,683
        Oh, yeah, because, uh...

407
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:09,020
         And we wrote           
         this song about... you.

408
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,622
        You wrote a song        
           about me?

   You guys are really good.    
  What do you call your band?   

425
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,123
         Three Artists          
         And A Buffoon.         

426
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,125
        Okay, that's it.        

427
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,528
      - What?                   
      - I'm the buffoon?        
      You're the buffoon.       

428
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,697
            You make fart jokes.
            I make art.         

429
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,799
You call that                   
noise art?                      

430
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,301
     Your rhymes are whack!     

431
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,537
       Yeah, well, yours        
           are hack.            

432
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,539
         Oh, good one.          

433
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,241
          - Hey, hey.           
             - Hey!             

434
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,779
             Stop.              
       You're all hacks,        

435
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,683
      except for the mime.      
        She's a genius.         

436
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,884
Get them!                       

437
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,727
I can't believe this.           

438
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,362
I almost had the key.           

439
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,498
Can't you two get along         
for just one minute?            

440
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,799
                  We like not   
                  getting along.

441
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,202
    Yeah. We're good at it.     

442
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,704
Wow! You guys                   
really had me fooled.           

443
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,941
        No, we really do        
        hate each other.        

444
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,711
                  Ah!           

445
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,479
                   Marco!       

446
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,348
Hey, king, we're                
busting you outta here.         

447
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,083
What are you doing?             

448
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,718
                 I won't abandon
                 my people.     

449
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,687
What?!                          

450
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,389
           Sometimes, you've got
           to let the king go.  

451
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,329
           Time's up.           

452
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,930
     So, um... ready to...      

453
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,633
        Where's my key?         

454
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,037
    I must've dropped my key    
     right in front of you,     

455
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,273
         and you didn't         
      even notice. What?!       

456
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,576
You could have been running free
by now, prancing in the fields. 

457
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,079
         Must make you          
       feel pretty silly.       

458
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,147
         Ha ha. Spider!         

459
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,918
So are you going to force       
everyone to like me,            

460
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,720
or is it levitato time?         

461
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,889
    You may have the crown,     
  but you will never be king.   

462
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,859
We'll see how you feel          
once you've been levitatoed.    

463
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,997
           No, River!           

464
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,833
                        Come on!

465
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,271
      Welcome to the reign      
         of King Ludo.          

466
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,440
      This is what happens      
           to anyone            

467
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,311
    who doesn't show respect    
 and adoration for their king.  

468
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,779
        You have any last words?

469
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,115
People of Mewni,                
I am not afraid.                

470
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,050
                 Blah blah blah.
                 Levitato.      

471
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,053
       ( people gasping )       

472
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:31,055
     What are we                
     gonna do now?              

473
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:34,191
              Now?              
           We fight.            

474
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,963
Uh, you know that's             
not mud, right?
