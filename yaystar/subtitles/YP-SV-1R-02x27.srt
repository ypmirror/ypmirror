 to go with me tonight, Star.   

39
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,065
        Dances make me          
      a little anxious.

00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,833
         What are you           
      so worried about?         

41
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:18,270
   Well, I had a nightmare      
that I came to the dance alone, 

42
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,806
     and everyone laughed       
  and threw tomatoes at me.     

43
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,508
  Then all my teeth fell out.   

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,077
 Oh, and then Jackie saw me,    
   and said I looked pasty.     

45
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,079
    That's not gonna happen.    

46

 What happened?                 

50
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,524
    I just saw a huge rat       
       in the air duct.         

51
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,259
Yeah. This place                
is a dump.                      

52
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,793

58
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,673
    It's time to find out       
    if the legend is true.      

59
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,675
Will Bon Bon come back?

at... wait, what?               

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,689
   Yeah, Bon Bon said he'd      
be back on his 100th death day, 

66
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,491
      and that's tonight.

I'd be his dance buddy tonight.

 just asked me to the dance.    

79
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,886

    Glossaryck, all clowns      
     have plastic noses.

00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,122
       No. Real clowns

157
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,530

00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:17,035
        You told Marco

161
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,970

00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,772

    - BOTH: It's Bon Bon!       

170
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,504
             Uh, so, I was just 
                     gonna ask. 

171
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,073
          What are your hobbies?

172

           Oh, uh,              
   lots of stuff, I guess.

       which you know.          

174
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,147
        I'm kinda into          
        history books.          

175
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,249
       I actually read          
 this really cool one about--   

176
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,952
       Hm, interesting.         
What kind of music do you like? 

177
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,288

     pretty mellow stuff.       

178
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,023
        I know that's           
        totally vague.          

179
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,658
        Next question.          
      Do you like food?         

180
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,093
       If so what kinds?        

181
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,461
         Wait. Hold on.         

182

        - It's all...

184
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,033
 It's all blue now.             

185
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,502
   - Here. Let me see that.     
      - No, no. No, no.

206
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,517
              I never should've 
        asked you to the dance. 

207
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,586

00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:08,106
   So as long as we're all      
 just sitting here chillin',    

231
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,575
  would it be cool if I got     
you guys' opinion on something? 

232
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,477
        Is this about           
         Marco again?           

233
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,380
          What? No.             
             Yes.               

234
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,916
    Could you please just       
    tell me what you think      
      of this one thing?        

235
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,718
                       Uh, sure.

236
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,721
       Notice anything          
        off about it?           

237
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,724
      See? Just because         
      Marco has a mole,         

238
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,993
 suddenly Jackie has to have,   
     like, eight of them.       

239
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,661
             Those are freckles.

240
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:30,996
    GLOSSARYCK: Hey, Star.      
         Star. Star!            

241
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,797
       Yes, interrupter.        

242
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,899
    Are you gonna use this?     

243
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,235
        - What is it?           
       - I don't know.          

244
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,770
      It's, like, a spell.      

245
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,673
   There's a little drawing     
    of a rat or something.      

246
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,342
Uh, we're kind of               
in the middle of something.     

247
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,145
   So I can do whatever I...    

248
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,546
      Yeah, whatever. Go.       

249
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,656
     Oh, whoops. I accidentally 
           deleted the picture. 

250
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,591
                 Problem solved?

251
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,292
      Can we just focus         
      on the shrine now?        

252
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,361
       Yes. Shrine time.        

253
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,707
       Okay, got that?          
          All right.            

254
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,276
    - Now stir the cereal.      
          - Got it.             

255
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,279
              Stir, stir, stir, 
              stir, stir, stir. 

256
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,316
               And then, we add 
                 one, just one, 
              malted milk ball. 

257
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,852
         One for me,            
         one for you.           

258
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,387
 Are you sure about this?       

259
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,356
         Jackie, trust the chef.

260
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,458
          ( laughs )            
          All right.            

261
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,362
    ( choking )                 

262
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,364
            Marco!              
         ( coughing )           

263
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,800
        It's terrible.          
         ( retches )            

264
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,269
     Really? It was good        
   the last time I had it.      

265
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,007
       Ugh. ( sputters )        

266
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,576
       ( giggling )             

267
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:55,380
     ( tentative laughter )     

268
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,215
           Your face.           

269
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,018
       ( both laughing )        

270
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,420
     See, Marco?                

271
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,090
You're adorable                 
when you laugh at yourself.     

272
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,224
             What?              

273
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,259
          Relax, dude.          

274
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,662
       I... I'm relaxed.        

275
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,964
         ( stammering )         

276
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,245
    Seriously, why are you      
         so nervous?            

277
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,247
       Uh, I don't know.        

278
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,049
     'Cause it's a date,        
    and you're super cool,      

279
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,383
         and I'm just           
    afraid of messing up.       

280
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,586
      Marco, you already        
          messed up.            

281
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,688
           - What?              
           - Yeah.              

282
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,624
     You puked on my lap        
       in third grade.          

283
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,459
    You broke my skateboard.    

284
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,428
       And then there's         
     that weird box thing       

285
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,930
     - you got trapped in       
     at Star's sleepover.       
        - Okay, okay.           

286
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,532
You sent me anonymous           
text messages of cats.          

287
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,200
                     All right. 
                   Point taken. 

288
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,368
        Then there was          
     the little neck guy        

289
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,403
       that came out of         
    your neck or whatever.      

290
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,439
    Jackie, I don't wanna       
         relive that.           

291
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,908
     Fair enough.               

292
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,276
But you know                    
what I like about you,          

293
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,112
is that even after              
a humiliating, crushing defeat, 

294
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,414
you just pick yourself          
right back up,                  

295
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,284
and you hop right back on,      
kinda like skateboarding.       

296
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,487
   Yeah, well, I don't know     
      how to skateboard         

297
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,657
           - What?              
       - No, I never...         
     What are you doing?        

298
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,161
                 Whoa! You just 
                      keep that 
                    down there? 

299
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,665
           - Well?              
      - No, no, no, no.         

300
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,967
          - Come on.            
        - No, no, no.           

301
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,937
  - Marco, you can do this.     
       - No, forget it.         

302
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,739
      Marco, do it for me?      

303
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,275
           Ugh. Okay.           

304
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,843
       I'm gonna do this.       

305
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,278
        Don't look down.        

306
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,946
             Don't look up.     

307
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,347
            ( stammering )      

308
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,186
      - Do you trust me?        
      - Yeah, I trust...        

309
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,688
                 Okay, I'm done.

310
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,192
          ( snoring )           

311
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,594
                 Janna, wake up!

312
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,329
        No, you shut up.        

313
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,131
           ( groans )           

314
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,433
      I might as well be        
   spending the night alone     

315
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,335
        in a graveyard.         

316
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,172
 If any dead clowns feel like   
  coming back from the dead     

317
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,675
     I think now would be       
     a pretty good time.        

318
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,714
   Ugh! Should've just gone     
    to that stupid dance.       

319
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,649
           ( beeps )            

320
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,818
         Bet Marco's            
     having a good time.        

321
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,955
   ( dialing, line ringing )    

322
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,389
          ( buzzing )           

323
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,658
      <i> Hey, it's Marco.</i>         
   <i> I'm not here right now,</i>     

324
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,360
     <i> but leave a message</i>

325
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,996
         Hey, Marco,            
        it's just me,           

326
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,998
        checkin' up on          
         my best bud.           

327
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,734
        Drop me a line          
      when you get home.        

328
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,703
          Just wanna            
       check up on you.         

329
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,404
       If you want to.          
      If not, that's...         

330
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,807
      that's cool, too.         
             Bye.               

331
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,477
         - ( groans )           
        - ( dialing )           

332
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,579
      <i> Hey, it's Marco.</i>         
  <i> I'm not here right now...</i>    

333
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,481

        - ( dialing )

00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,559
      ( frustrated groan )      

340
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,160
  Why aren't you picking up?!   

341
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,996
          ( snoring )           

342
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,504
 Glossaryck, wake up.           

343
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,540
Hey, what's the name            
of that spying spell?           

344
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,609
         ( muttering )          

345
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:15,246
   Oh. The all-seeing eye,      
  uh, you're talking about.     

346
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,016
        - Where is it?          
      - That would be...        

347
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,350
       that would be in         
      Eclypso's chapter.        

348
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,052
     Oh, wait, wait, wait.      

349
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,754
   You don't wanna go there.    

350
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,024
              Eclypso...        

351
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,527
           Dark magic. Not nice 
              to spy on people. 

352
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,297
( laughs )                      
Glossaryck,                     
don't be ridiculous.            

353
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,465
I'm not using it                
to spy on anyone.               

354
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,535
         Spying leads to crying.

355
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,237
             ( snoring )        

356
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,239
     Well, I'm not spying.      

357
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,974
     ( snoring continues )      

358
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,376
        Aha! Here it is.        

359
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,480
           I summon             
      the all-seeing eye        

360
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,783
        to tear a hole          
        into the sky.           

361
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,485
         Reveal to me           
    that which is hidden.       

362
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,288
         Unveil to me           
      what is forbidden.        

363
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,996
                  Whoa!         

364
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,932
Don't worry.                    
I've got you.                   

365
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,567
              Oh!               

366
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,005
           ( growls )           

367
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,743
             What?!             

368
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,146
           ( yells )            

369
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,581
 What'd I miss?                 

370
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,683
       - Did I do that?         
    - Yes, you fell on me.      

371
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,485
          I know I fell on you. 
          I was there for that. 

372
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,287
There was this eyeball spell,   
    and Jackie and Marco--      

373
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,290
Slow down, woman.               
You are not making              
any sense.                      

374
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,760
              Shoo! Shoo, shoo. 
               Get out of here, 
                you giant rats. 

375
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,503
It's happening.                 

376
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,609
         You came back.         

377
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,715
      Oh, that explosion        
did a real number on your face. 

378
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,550
     ( maniacal laughter )      

379
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,952
           Surprise.            

380
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,654
                 Ludo?          

381
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,623
       Miss me, princess?       

382
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,660
Are you okay?                   

383
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,163
                 Yeah, I'm fine.

384
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,699
                 Haven't ate it 
                      like that 
                      in years. 

385
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,405
  You know, I'm really glad     
       I asked you out.         

386
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,607
     Me, too.                   

387
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,651
            Marco?              
     Is everything okay?        

388
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,092
     We have to find Star.      

389
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,664
       Get her, get her!        

390
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,937
  Shimmering crystal see-saw!   

391
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,641
         ( screeching )         

392
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:58,910
            Get her!            

393
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,312
      Rainbow fist punch!       

394
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,520
    Syrup tsunami shockwave!    

395
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,626
           You guys             
    are ruining my séance.      

396
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,867
     Mega starfish tsunami!     

397
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,077
      Mystic Suck Portal.       

398
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,679
           Not again!           

399
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,886
  I'm back, just like my...     
         ( screams )            

400
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,655
    Please have mercy on me.    

401
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,391
   I would have mercy on you.   

402
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,146
          JANNA: Help!          

403
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,315
        Bad vermin. Bad.        

404
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,817
             Janna.             

405
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,497
        Aw, looks like          
  you need a hand, princess.    

406
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,100
   What do you want with me?    

407
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,202
  You think I'm here for you.   

408
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,970
          So selfish.           

409
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,740
           Ha! Fetch!           

410
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,380
       - My spell book?         
            - Yes.              

411
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,515
    I figured it would be       
      okay if I took it,        

412
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,051
      seeing how you're         
probably not going to need it   

413
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,886
      where you're going.       

414
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,889
        ( evil laugh )          
      As the humans say,        

415
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,525
        destroying you          
     will be easy as pie.       

416
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,261
       I think you mean         
        piece of cake.          

417
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,898
     You will pay for that.     

418
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,800
         I'm on fire,           
         I'm on fire!           

419
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,403
    Put me out, put me out!     

420
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,874
        Oh, great job...        

421
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,910
                  Fetch Spider. 
          We have what we want. 

422
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,182
        No, no, no, no!         

423
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,384
       ( rats squeaking )       

424
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,053
                   ( straining )

425
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,755
Do you really wanna             
waste precious time             
chasing me?                     

426
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,090
I mean, look.                   

427
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,693
             Star!              

428
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,128
       ( Ludo cackling )        

429
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,069
                  Marco, let go.

430
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,104
         You're gonna           
     get pulled in, too.        

431
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,772
      I'm not letting go.       

432
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,682
     You okay?                  

433
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,353
         Yeah, yeah.            
        Thanks to you.          

434
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,854
           Jackie, are you okay?

435
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,889
 Yeah. I'm great.               

436
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,792
This is the funnest dance       
I've ever been to.              

437
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:06,264
MARCO: Yeah, well, I mean, yeah,
 we're in a graveyard, so...    

438
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,235
       I can't believe          
   Ludo took my spell book.     

439
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,237
     It's got everything        
            in it.              

440
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,939
       That's my whole          
       family history.          

441
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,907
       All the spells,          
    everything, it's lost.      

442
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,310
              We'll get it back.

443
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,779
     I've lost Glossaryck.      

444
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,816
    We'll get him back, too.    

445
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,118
               I promise.       

446
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,126
    At your service, milady.    

447

       I'm not a milady.
