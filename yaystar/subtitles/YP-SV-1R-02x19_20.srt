                    Hey, Marco. 
            Can I get your help 
                with something? 

20
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,722
    Can't help right now.       
       I just found out         

21
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,091
    there's a Mackie Hand       
   movie marathon tonight,      

22
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,427
    - and I can't miss it.      
  - Ooh. Who's Mackie Hand?     

23
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,695
He's the greatest martial-arts  
  superstar who ever lived.     

24
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,397
     He died 30 years ago       
       while performing         

25
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,099
    one of his own stunts       
            on...               

26
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,201
     himself. Accidentally.     

27
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,837
      Come on, come on,         
           come on!             

28
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,740
       ( inhales deeply )       

29
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,743
             Ooh!!              

30
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,411
                    What is it? 
                  What's wrong? 

31
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,246
         It's sold out.         

32
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,583
                 Oh. I'm sorry, 
                    little guy. 

33
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,618
         ( muffled )            
          It's okay.            

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,389
It was just a once-in-a-lifetime
         opportunity.           

35
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,425
          Don't worry. I'm sure 
       there's a chance you can 
            still get a ticket. 

36
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,661
         Good things            
     don't happen to me.        

37
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,899
        Hey. What's up?         

38
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,968
         - BOTH: Tom?           
  - What are you doing here?    

39
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,904
  Actually, I was wondering     
    if we could hang out.       

40
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,741
               Ugh. No, no, no. 
            A million times no. 

41
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,311
Not with you, Star.             
I meant with Marco.             

42
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,713
         Huh? Uh... no.         

43
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,748
         Oh. Okay then.         

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,717
     Guess I'll just find       
        somebody else           

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,788
        to go with to           
the Mackie Hand movie marathon. 

46
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,623
           Huh? What?           

47
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,824
      Wait, you're a fan        
       of Mackie Hand?          

48
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,426
 I'm a super fan.               

49
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,628
       Why do you want          
        to go with me?          

50
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,265
I really thought                
we connected that one time.     

51
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,733
Over ping-pong?                 

52
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,668
               You kidnapped me.

53
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,805
Look, I know I've been          
a little aggro in the past,     

54
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,474
 and I'm sorry.                 

55
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,009
I promise not to                
get mad this time.              

56
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,511
                    ( grunting )

57
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,280
Star, what is he up to?         

58
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,282
             I think you should 
                   go with him. 

59
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,985
          He's obviously trying 
             to bury the hammer 
                   or whatever. 

60
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,120
Hatchet.                        
Bury the hatchet.               

61
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,122
      Well, the marathon        
        is all the way          

62
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,757
   on the other side of town,   

63
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,527
     so... are you coming       
           or not?              

64
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,202
             Whoa!              

65
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,971
         Let me just            
       give you a tour.         

66
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,673
   Giddy up, skeleton horse.    

67
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,209
                    ( whinnies )

68
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,011
                  So here it is.

69
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,879
                     We got six 
              flat-screen TV's, 

70
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,814
                 a photo booth, 
               karaoke machine. 

71
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,884
   - Is that a white tiger?     
     - ( purring loudly )       

72
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,786
         And up here            
        is the lounge.          

73
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,355
      Here. Have a seat         
        in the throne.          

74
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,291
     Are you comfortable?       
   Can I get you anything?      

75
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,859
      Some cereal perhaps?      

76
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,830
      Look, you're being        
 super nice to me right now,    

77
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,533
       and you're never         
         nice to me.            

78
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,734
      What's this really        
          all about?            

79
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,804
       Wha... I'm just          
          a huge fan            

80
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,306
        of Mackie Hand.         

81
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,575
           What's your favorite 
        Mackie Hand movie then? 

82
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,143
Uh, it's...                     
( stammering )                  

83
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,978
                      I knew it.

84
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,814
       You don't know the first 
           thing about kung-fu. 
                I'm outta here. 

85
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,816
        No, wait, wait.         

86
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,719
      It's just because         
    I have two favorites.       

87
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,753
     <i> Hand To Hand To Hand,</i>     

88
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,089
  and <i> Hand To Hand To Hand 2.</i>  

89
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,359
   Now that I'm saying it,      
     I'm gonna have to go       
      with the original.        

90
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,362
   Oh. Yeah, you're right.      
    That is the best one.       

91
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,863
 But not the English version.   

92
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,366
I'm talking about               
the original in Swedish.        

93
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:57,369
     Huh. I guess you do        
         like stuff.            

94
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,072
         I'm... sorry.          

95
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,174
No, no, no,                     
I get it, I get it.             

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,244
It can be hard to               
break through people's          
preconceptions of me.           

97
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,045
That's why I don't              
have many friends.              

98
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,047
I haven't even been to          
a movie marathon before.        

99
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,582
              ( engine revving )

100
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,951
  Hey, where did you pick up    
       your sweet ride?         

101
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,886
       At a funeral home?       

102
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,356
       Are you gonna go pick up 
         someone's dead grandpa 

103
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,424
          and hold a respectful 
               service for him? 

104
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,927
             You think you guys 
                      are fast? 

105
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,930
     I can guarantee that we'll 
     beat you to the next light 

106
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,765
                   without even 
              breaking a sweat. 

107
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,568
      Yeah. What are ya,        
           chicken?             

108
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,570
          BOTH: What?!          

109
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,038
            - Bro.              
            - Bro.              

110
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,807
            - Bro!              
      - You're on, punk.        

111
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,611
      ( tires squealing )       

112
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,813
Oh, I'll show them.             

113
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,415
                        No, no. 
              Wait, wait, wait. 

114
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:47,219
       ( siren blaring,         
    police radio chatter )      

115
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,521
                 Those guys are 
                 going to jail. 

116
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,766
 ( raucous laughter )           

117
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,801
Oh, that was...                 
that was so much more fun       

118
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,903
than obliterating people.       

119
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,938
         Yeah! This whole thing 
                  reminds me of 

120
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,507
      one of my favorite songs, 
             "Awesome Feeling." 

121
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,475
Wait, wait, wait.               

122
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,744
Isn't that a song               
by Love Sentence?               

123
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,812
                ( humming song )

124
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,816
                    Uhhhh....   

125
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,117
                           Yeah.

126
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,987
 Come with me.                  

127
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,190
            No way!             

128
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:29,661
  You have a signed picture     
  of you and Justin Towers?     

129
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,265
I also have a vintage           
five-disc CD player

         I know. Right?

00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,376
   Heck, I could just skip

00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,977
         Oh, my gosh.           
        The marathon.

148
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,115
       It starts in...          
        ten minutes?!           

149
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,386
         What the heck?         

150
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,755
 Hey, can you unlock the door?  

151
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:34,226
      Actually, I can't         
      let you leave yet.        

152
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,028
    What? But we gotta go.      
     We're gonna be late.       

153
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,898
       Couldn't we just         
    chill here for, like,       

154
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,533
   another four-and-a-half      
           minutes?             

155
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,069
        No. Seriously,          
          let me go.            

156
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,737
Please.                         

157
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,740
Just wait                       
a little longer.                

158
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,543
        What is wrong with you? 
              I said let me go! 

159
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,879
        And I said wait!        

160
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,781
       ( whistle blows )        

161
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,917
          Sorry, Tom.           

162
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,353
    That's an instant fail      
           for you.             

163
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,789
   Hey, you almost made it      
          this time.            

164
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,457
                        No, no. 
                    Wait, wait. 

165
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,292
      You gotta give me         
       a second chance.         

166
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,595
Okay, seriously,                
what is going on here?          

167
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,764
Dude, I cleaned                 
your litter box.                

168
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,300
Well, Master Tom here           
was just about to earn          

169
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,869
his anger management            
graduation badge.               

170
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,539
All he had to do                
was spend three hours alone     

171
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,875
with the person                 
he hated the most               
without blowing up.             

172
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,144
           But you,             
    you had to be selfish.      

173
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,980
    You could wait another      
 four minutes and 15 seconds.   

174
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,317
 All you care about are your    
precious karate movie tickets.  

175
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,653
     - Well, guess what.        
         - ( gasps )            

176
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,622
      Mackie Hand movies        
         are garbage.           

177
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,629
      Are you kidding me?       

178
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,132
     You lied to me about       
     being a Mackie fan,        

179
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,967
            and pretended to be 
                      my friend 

180
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,236
      so you could earn         
         some badge?            

181
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,005
     Dude, you're a jerk        
         and a liar,            

182
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,174
            and that's not even 
                the worst part. 

183
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,376
      I was dumb enough         
       to fall for it!          

184
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,451
          Marco, wait.          

185
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:10,021
   I do like Love Sentence.     
   That part wasn't a lie.      

186
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,257
         Too little,

 I hope I didn't make us fall

207
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:03,301
  Mr. Hand, I can't believe     
       it's really you.         

208
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,136
               Say, you must be 
                    the new PA. 

209
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,472
                  Kevin, right? 
              Nice to meet you. 

210
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,141
Oh, my gosh. I wish I had       
something for you to sign.      

211
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,543
      Eh, don't sweat it.       

212
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,378
       I gotcha covered.        

213
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,213
          Hold still.           

214
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,749
                   There you go.

215
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,585
Tom, I can't believe you brought
Mackie Hand back from the dead  

216
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,120
                    just for me!

217
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,556
           That was... that was 
                   cool of you. 

218
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,324
        Wait, I'm dead?         

219
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,333
  Three for the Mackie Hand     
      marathon, please.         

220
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,135
    What does the sign say?     

221
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,271
   Wait, but... do you know     
         who this is?           

222
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,674
  This is <i> the </i> Mackie Hand     
        in the flesh.           

223
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,478
   Nice costume, but no one     
  gets in without a ticket.     

224
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,848
   Now shove off, grandpa,      
before I have to get physical.  

225
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,188
           Hey! You!            

226
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,628
              You were right.   

227
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,163
            This guy's for real.

228
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,198
Yeah. I told you.               

229
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,601
I still don't                   
like you, Tom.                  

230
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,670
                  I still don't 
          like you, too, Marco. 

231
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,389
          Is mystery.           

232
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,961
      How is there hole         
    in Newman force field?      

233
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:41,332
  Maybe better question is,     
        who make hole?          

234
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,736
      They find weakness        
       in Newman magic.         

235
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,905
   Could be huge advantage      
      for all monsters.         

236
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,642
        Help my babies          
         have future.           

237
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,579
   You do realize that when     
       you're writing,          

238
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,281
    you're talking out loud.    

239
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,920
     Uh... oh, thank you.       
  I didn't realize I was...     

240
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,293
          ( groaning )          

241
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,866
          Hey, rat,             
     what is this place?        

242
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,235
             ( angry squealing )

243
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,604
         ( struggling )         

244
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,873
         There's only           
     one way outta here,        

245
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,008
      and it's through me.      

246
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,377
   Uh, okay, but I did not      
        ask to leave.           

247
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,013
         Nice try, pal,         

248
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,917
  but you're not gonna talk     
     your way outta here.       

249
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,587
     'Cause the only way...     

250
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,123
         out of here...         

251
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,959
         is through me.         

252
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,761
          Okay, but...          

253
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,395
          ( groaning )          

254
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,197
         What is this?          

255
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,766
         ( screaming )          

256
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,434
          ( whistles )          

257
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,036
            Hm? Oh.             

258
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,975
       This could feed          
      a lot of monsters.        

259
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,878
    So where does all this      
      delicious corn go?        

260
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,180
To the grinder.                 

261
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,461
      Hey, stop the thing.      

262
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,298
         Why does he            
        have to yell?           

263
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,733
             Hands.             

264
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,105
         I will not.            
        Okay, I will.           

265
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,474
Get to work,                    
frog man.                       

266
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,309
         What are ya            
         waiting for?           

267
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,145
          Get moving!           

268
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,984
So tell me,                     
where does all this corn go     

269
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,320
 after we grind it?             

270
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,123
      It goes in the hole.      

271
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,758
 Why?                           

272
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,993
     'Cause if we don't,        
we get thrown down that hole.   

273
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,498
No. I mean,                     
where does it go                

274
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,834
            It goes in the hole.

275
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,369
Okay, we established that.      
But then what?                  

276
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,505
             Then we eat dinner.

277
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,341
        No, the corn!           
 I'm talking about the corn!    

278
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,044
    Where does the corn go?     

279
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,279
         Oh, the corn.          

280
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:11,282
      It goes in the hole.      

281
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,184
( frustrated stammering )       

282
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,387
Yes, the corn goes              
in the hole.                    

283
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,857
        So you do know          
     where it goes then.        

284
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,360
You know exactly                
where it goes.                  

285
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,363
 It goes in your pockets.       

286
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,133
     ( nervous chuckle )        
    How did those kernels       
        get in there?           

287
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:33,738
The boss doesn't look           
kindly on those who             
steal from him.                 

288
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,840
      He wants to see you.      

289
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,977
        The boss wants          
          to see me?            

290
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,546
        - The... boss!          
       - ( screaming )          

291
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,580
          No, no, no!           

292
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,916
             Boss?              

293
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,420
   Hey, whoa, whoa, no need     
to get the boss involved here.  

294
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,022
       It's just a few          
       kernels of corn.         

295
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,992
No worries.                     
I got this.                     

296
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,761
 Hey, I'll even make sure to    
scream all the way down, okay?  

297
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,930
  Enjoy the rest of your day.   

298
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,498
             Bye!               
        ( screaming )           

299
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,771
       ( scream fades,          
        then resumes )          

300
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:16,848
        Must find out           
         who is boss.           

301
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,516
No fun!                         

302
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,659
          ( snoring )           

303
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,990
          ( laughing )          

304
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,662
         This guy has           
        own cornfield.          

305
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,567
         This guy has           
        own cornfie...          

306
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,380
           Cornmeal.            

307
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,714
         ( squeaking )          

308
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:13,898
         Unicastle...           
        made of corn?           

309
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,175
              Oh!               

310
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,544
           ( gasps )            

311
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,213
Know why they call me           
Meat Fork?                      

312
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,715
                        Why?    

313
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:35,420
         Because it's           
        a family name.          

314
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,555
      I'm not going back        
         to grinder.            

315
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,924
            - No?               
            - No.               

316
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,226

318
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,230
              No.               

319
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,934
Okay. Then can you please       
take me with you?

00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,602

          Green hole.

       Did you see that?        

330
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:29,807
          It worked!            
    ( maniacal laughter )       

331
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,875
             Ludo!              

332
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,813
        Hello, Buffrog.         

333
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,051
            It's been a while...

334
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,054
          old friend.           

335
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,656
        You're... alive.        

336
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,225
    Don't act so surprised.     

337
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,894
    It makes it seem like       
      you want me dead.         

338
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,230
         No, please.            
       I am father now.         

339
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,499
         I know that,           
          you idiot.            

340
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,734
       I'm the one who          
      gave you those...         

341
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,774
        You see, girls?         

342
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,676
 This is why I need that book.  

343
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:09,347
     Don't know what I'm        
    doing with this thing.      

344
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,151
         - Gotta go.            
     - He's getting away!       

345
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,756
        Just swallow it.        

346
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,327
     But I want him to die.     

347
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,331
           Uh, fine.            

348
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,401
         Spit him out.          

349
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,707
         I was going            
       to let you die,          

350
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,877
 but my wand told me to give    
   you Meat Fork's old job.     

351
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,312
           Meat Fork?           

352
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,548
          ( groaning )          

353
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,782
             Yeah.              

354
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,817
           Meat Fork!           

355
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,353
      But you don't need        
        monsters now.           

356
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,722
         You have wand.         

357
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,492
     Spider, bird, corn.        
            Rats.               

358
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,827
    Yeah, it's pretty sweet.    

359
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,231
        But you know,           
   there's more to be done.     

360
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,167
             So what do you say?

361
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,370
            We gettin' the band 
         back together or what? 

362
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,242
I'm... I'm sorry.               

363
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,377
I think                         
you've lost your mind.          

364
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,743
       With wand, Ludo          
   more powerful than ever,     

365
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,913
        but more crazy          
       than ever, too.          

366
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,049
       He make Buffrog          
      intriguing offer.         

367
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,952
        But did I make          
right choice for my tadpoles?   

368
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,361
        Have crazy idea,        

369
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:06,764
    but have to make sure       
I'm not talking out loud first. 

370
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,368
       A big black bug          
    bit a big black bear.       

371
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,970
  Rubber baby buggy bumpers.    
         Okay, good.
