00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,989
    he's kind of sensitive      
          about it.             

120
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,257
 ( makes motorboat sounds )     

121
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,860
         Father Time?           
 So you must push this thing.   

122
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,030
          Hey, look!            
        I'm over here.          

123
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,500
   And now, I'm over here!      
         Ha ha ha ha!           

124
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,970
         And how long           
   were you <i> on </i> the wheel?     

125
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,139
 Oh, you know, forever.         

126
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,941
        Until someone           
     cast a freeze spell        

127
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,209
and knocked me off of it.       

128
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,378
    What is <i> that?</i>              

129
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,246
 Uh, mud?                       

130
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,516
       Oh, it's glorious!       

131
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,452
                  I <i> love </i> mud. 

132
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,521
               ( gags )         

133
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,559
        So, Mr. Time,           
   how would you feel about     

134
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,594
     getting the universe       
      started up again?         

135
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,365
   Oh, where has this been      
       all of my life?          

136
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,966
Ah, look, look, look.           

137
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,902
    You can play with mud       
        on your wheel.          

138
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,204
             Huh?               
             Huh?               

139
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:16,541
Well, that is an enticing offer,
           but nah.             

140
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,344
           Arrghh!              
     Oh! There's some mud       
      that's a slightly         
       different color.         

141
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,346
     And there's a twig,        
     and there's a bush,        

142
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,416
        and I don't know        
        what that thing is,     
        but it's waddling.      

143
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,952
     Wait! You can't just       
     leave time stopped!        

144
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,887
             Whoo!              

145
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,322
               But without time,

146
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,090
     rainbows can't shoot       
       across the sky,          

147
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,925
          glitter can't glitter!

148
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,061
     And everyone we know       
   will be frozen forever!      

149
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,363
    What's this?                

150
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,998
       Ooh!                     

151
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,033
          ( laughing )          

152
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,536
          YOLO! Ha ha!          

153
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,171
      Anything's possible.      

154
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,910
         Yah! Whoo-hoo!         

155
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,946
       ( clock ticking )        

156
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,082
          I hate this dimension.

157
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,451
        Ha ha ha! Whoo!         

158
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,753
        Oh! Ha ha ha ha!        

159
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,297
         Oh, my hearts.         

160
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,436
          Not a word.           

161
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,537
              Hee hee hee!      

162
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,141
 I think he went in there.      

163
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,579
           Wow.                 

164
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,248
       It's the history         
    of the whole universe.      

165
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,218
  Ooh! Battle of Lexington.     
          Nailed it.            

166
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,563
    ( gasps ) It--              

167
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,964
               It's me!         

168
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,372
      Oh, I remember that!      

169
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,211
        ( chuckling )           
     Watching me is fun.        

170
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,782
             Oh!                
           Hi, me!              

171
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,751
This place must keep track      
of everything we've done        
in our lives.                   

172
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:37,015
    Wow. I've been nodding      
       for a long time.         

173
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,250
FATHER TIME: Hey, guys!         

174
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:41,186
 Isn't this place incredible?   

175
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,088
    It's like we're living      
        in the future.          

176
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,122
      Father Time!              

177
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,024
           Emerald Snake Strike!

178
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,694
            Great.              
     I think we got him.        

179
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,497
          Yuck. Okay, buddy,    

180
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,299
        let's get you           
     back to your wheel.        

181
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,634
           ( gasps )            

182
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,584
       ( clock ticking )        

183
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,186
            Ahh, all right.     

184
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,122
    I guess I'll get back       
        to doing that.          

185
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,758
          Oh, well,             
 it's only for all eternity.    

186
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,359
               ( sighs )        

187
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,061
         We can't just make him.

188
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,231
 Maybe there's some other way   
  to turn that giant wheel.     

189
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,234
 ( chittering )                 

190
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,470
       Are you thinkin'         
      what I'm thinkin'?        

191
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:36,474
Actually, I was thinking we'd-- 
    Never mind, it works.       

192
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,743
        Now you can go          
      anywhere you want,        

193
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,245
  <i> and </i> keep the wheel moving!  

194
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,181
      Aww, thanks, guys.        
          I owe ya.             

195
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,816
    Please, help yourself       
      to any of my mud.         

196
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,285
     Even the nice stuff.       
         We're good.            

197
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,588
        Oh, and maybe           
   don't freeze time again.     

198
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,223
    It's kind of fragile.       
 You don't want to break it.    

199
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,258
       Know what I mean?        

200
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
     Well, so long. Ha ha!      

201
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,597
     Time hamsters away!        
           Yoo-hoo!             

202
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,402
Wait, the wheel's moving.       

203
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,104
          TOGETHER:             
    We've got to get back!      

204
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,439
       ( clock ticking )        

205
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,475
      ( puppies yipping )       

206
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,843
          ( singing )           

207
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,879
            Whoa!               
            Aaaah!              

208
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,192
          Hey, Jackie.          

209
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,161
          Hey, Marco.           

210
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,331
Well, see ya.                   

211
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,437
         You did it!            
  You finally talked to her!    

212
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,439
        What happened           
to waiting for the perfect time?

213
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,274
    Well, all of a sudden,      
          I thought,            

214
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,777
    if you have the time,       
        why waste it?           

215
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,746
   Looks like I'm finally       

216
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,281
         ( slow-mo )            
     getting somewhere...       

217
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,718
 Ha ha! You guys really get me! 

218
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,256
          ( yawning )           

219
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,925
    STAR: Morning, Marco!       
             Hey.               

220
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:04,162
            Aaaah! Whoaah!      

221
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,931
      ( Marco screaming )       

222
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:10,368
      ( laughing ) Whooo!       

223
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,803
     Oh, that was awesome!      

224
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,505
 I know, right?                 

225
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,474
Stairs are so boring.           

226
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,810
 I hope my parents don't flip   
     when they see this.        

227
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,278
          MAN: I'm flipping!    

228
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,516
             Dad!               
         Relax, son.            

229
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,453
This is like the perfect getaway
without actually getting away.  

230
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,655
    ( laughing ) Oh, boy!       
    ( dolphin chattering )      

231
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,625
         ( laughing )           
     I love living here!        

232
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:37,228
If my parents found out         
I've been using magic           
for stuff like this...          

233
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,863
       How about that?          
        This was cool,          

234
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,800
        but next time,          
   maybe a little heads-up?     

235
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,203
Wet socks are a form of torture 
      in some countries.        

236
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,671
     ( doorbell ringing )       
         I'll get it!           

237
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,374
   ( blows horn )               

238
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,809
        Oh, hey, Dad.           
            Dad?!               

239
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,812
           Hello--              
           Oh, no!              
  I need to hide everything.    

240
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,547
      ( foghorn blaring )       

241
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,453
  What a pleasant surprise.     
        ( fake laugh )          

242
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,987
     What brings you here       
        unexpectedly?           

243
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,390
            Well,               
I was in the neighborhood and-- 

244
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,492
             Agh.               
      Who am I kidding?         

245
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,428
  You mother has banished me    
       from the castle.         

246
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,997
       What did you do?         
           Nothing!             

247
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,533
 I just left a garment or two   
        laying around.          

248
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,603
      I thought perhaps,        
 I could stay here for a day    

249
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,572
   while this blows over.       

250
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,742
 Of course you can stay here.   
      You are <i> familia.</i>         

251
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,245
You can watch the kids while me 
and the wifey actually get away.

252
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,279
<i>Hasta mañana.</i>                   

253
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,547
         Ah, good show!         

254
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,582
        Huh? Oh, hello--        

255
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,784
            Aaah!               
         ( yipping )            

256
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,254
  Star, if you mother was here  

257
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,890
   and knew you were using      
  your wand inappropriately,    

258
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,593
      she would send you        
   straight to St. Olga's.      

259
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,763
    But I'm not your mother!    

260
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,266
  I rather enjoy destructive    
       magical puppies.         

261
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,436
    This visit is actually      
      gonna be fun then!        

262
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,904
 TOGETHER: Father-Daughter Day! 

263
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,706
              Tour time!        

264
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,675
     Hey, guys, hold up.        
I'm gonna go change my socks.   

265
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,712
        Ugh, it's like          
   I'm walking in pudding.      

266
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,781
           Check out <i> my </i> room. 

267
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,683
    Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!           

268
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,720
     ( creatures giggling )     

269
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,456
           Get him!             
           Get him!             

270
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,423
 Gut him like a fish!           

271
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,926
        I got 20 bucks on Teddy!

272
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,327
       ALL: Hi, Star!           

273
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,829
          I'm Kevin.            
           I'm new.             

274
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,298
     Magnificent!               

275
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,333
      If you like this,         
       let me show you          

276
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,803
    the most magical room       
     in the whole house.        

277
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,472
The bathroom!                   

278
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,909
   ( gasping, grunting )        

279
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,744
    What a glorious throne!     

280
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:35,480
    Why does it have a hole?    

281
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:40,351
Um, humans put things in there  
     and flush 'em down.        

282
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,053
            Flush?              
       What's a flush?          

283
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,622
  ( water flushing )            

284
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,959
           My word,             
   where does the water go?     

285
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,361
 Nobody knows.                  

286
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:54,465
It's one of Earth's             
greatest mysteries.             

287
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,434
             Does this go in it?

288
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,969
  All the time.                 

289
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,405
          ( flushing )          

290
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,809
                  ( gasps )     

291
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:09,047
          ( huffing, puffing )  

292
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,683
            This?               
     I don't see why not.       

293
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,918
          (flushing )           

294
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,919
                 This?          

295
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,821
           Go for it.           

296
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,524
          DAD: This?            
       STAR: Go ahead!          

297
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,992
What are they doing in there?   

298
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,861
         ( laughing )           
            This?               

299
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,430
             Do it.             

300
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,465
          ( flushing )          

301
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,067
 ( growling )                   

302
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,070
          Hey, Marco.           

303
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,838
DAD: Love the bathroom!         

304
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,841
     Thanks. What's next        
 on the itinerary for the d--   

305
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,377
         Ohh-ohh-ohhhh!         

306
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,879
       Marco taught me          
      how to play this.         

307
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,814
      You are absolutely        
        gonna love it.          

308
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:46,684
     The goal is to knock       
this tiny moon into that hole.  

309
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,454
            Ha ha!              
          What fun!             

310
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,457
   You're holding your club     
         upside-down.           

311
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,025
        This is a club?         

312
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,628
      There's one thing         
   we got better on Mewni.      

313
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,630
           Tally-ho!            

314
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,468
    Ha ha! How's that for       
  getting it into the hole?     

315
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,404
      What's that?              

316
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,805
               ♪ ( music box ) ♪

317
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,074
   That's the Candy Castle.     
        The next hole.          

318
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,977
        Lord Salivary           
   of the Weebler elf clan.

00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,517
   Ha ha!

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,487
            Mommy,              
   why is Santa doing that?     

323
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,055
              Dad!              

324
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,425
I'll teach you to give my wife  
       the googly eye!

327

  The ball's in your court,

        Dad, what are you doing?

00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,466
   Ha ha ha! Hello, darling!    

337
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,569
   It's the middle of the night.

338
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,105
     Ah, the perfect time       
        for a tussle.           

339
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,474
 Isn't that right, clowney?     

340
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,042
      The name is Kevin,        
           old man!

00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,478
                   Arrr!        

342
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,146
           Give it up, clown!   

343

        Bring the pain!         

344
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,785
 I can do this all night.

     CLOWN: Chicky-wink.        

346
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,693
Good morning, Star.             

347
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,729
              Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

348
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,633
   It was ridiculously loud     
         last night.            

349
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,169
     It wasn't me, Oscar.       
        It was my dad.          

350
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,771
          He's insane!          

351
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,539
        He just thinks          
  he can come down to Earth     

352
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,607
       and do whatever he wants.

353
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,576
         He is so inconsiderate.

354
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,645
             Huh.               
    I can weirdly relate.       

355
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,680
               What do you mean?

356
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,182
Doesn't that sound <i> familiar?</i>   

357
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,253
                 Yeah.          

358
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,089
         He does this to my mom.

359
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,725
        Never mind.             

360
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,828
            Well, I'm just glad 
            he's leaving today. 

361
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,531
    I don't know how much       
   more of this I can take.     

362
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,600
 Hello, Star.                   

363
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,069
        Dad, what are you doing?

364
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,937
      I'm hanging lights        
        for the party.          

365
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,540
         What party?            
          Oh, jeez!             

366
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,042
I forgot to tell you.           

367
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,277
          I'm having            
   such a great time here,      

368
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,579
I've decided to stay.           

369
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,647
Isn't that great?               

370
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,582
                   Greeeeeat.   

371
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,651
    Oh, and in celebration      
       of moving here,          

372
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,587
I've invited some friends       
to check out my new digs.       

373
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,822
     ( doorbell ringing )       
        They're here.           

374
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,558
       ( party chatter )        

375
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,260
      Chew, chew, chew,         
         chew, chew!            

376
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:45,630
  ( giggling )                  
  Don't wake him up, man.       

377
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,099
          We'll see if Salivary 
        recovers from this one. 

378
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,001
          ( laughing )          

379
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,070
      Dad, I really need        
  to talk to you right now.     

380
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,604
       HELIOS: Hey, guys!       

381
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:57,008
    Well, here I am! Yeah!      
   Now the party can start.     

382
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,077
   Ha ha! Ooh, tight squeeze.   

383
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,345
         My bad.                

384
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,415
           Oh, no.              
     Who invited Helios?        

385
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,651
          That guy is the worst.

386
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,754
            Gross!              
 Now he got his ear pierced?    

387
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,224
        There he goes,          
  eating all the appetizers.    

388
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,659
            He ruins every party

389
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,894
      and is completely         
     oblivious about it.        

390
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,697
            Funny.              
    I can weirdly relate.       

391
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,934
   Look, people are already     
 going into orbit around him.   

392
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,902
 No, no, no! Please, somebody!  

393
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,737
 His gravitational pull--       

394
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,906
       So why don't you         
      just kick him out?        

395
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,275
  Along with <i> everyone </i> else?   

396
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,911
           No way.              
I'm not talking to that tool.   

397
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,046
              Ugh!              

398
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,248
 Uh, hey, guys.                 

399
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,850
   Are those water balloo--     
            Whoa!               

400
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,651
 Punch. Punch. Punch.           

401
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,054
     No, no, no, no, no.        
            Whoah!              

402
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:46,290
   Your feet are so soft.       

403
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,659
       Aaaah! No!               

404
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:52,063
Whoo! Everybody, dancing really 
   sure works up my appe--      

405
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,397
      Oho, dessert!             

406
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,935
      Excuse me, I think        
you've overstayed your welcome  

407
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,670
and you gotta go.               

408
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,874
            Well,               
 you want to know something?    

409
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,408
  I may be filled with hydrogen,

410
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,344
      but you're filled         
       with annoy-ogen.         

411
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,713
         You just got           
      burned by the sun!        

412
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,047
                ( laughing )    

413
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,682
     Whoa!                      

414
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,217
MARCO:                          
I don't ask for much.           

415
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,354
Just a pair of dry socks,       
that's all.                     

416
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,290
It's like I'm mushing bananas   
       between my toes.         

417
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,659
            Marco, I am so sorry

418
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,661
       that every time          
  I tried to have some fun,     

419
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,130
  I ended up soaking your socks.

420
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,766
Look, I love all the fun things 
       you want to do,          

421
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,235
    just a little heads-up      
        would be nice.          

422
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,071
 There's really nothing worse   
       than wet socks.          

423
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,374
                       Oh, yeah.

424
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,309
                   Oh, yeah!    

425
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,978
   Nothing worse than wet socks.

426
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,847
          ( laughing )          

427
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,751
      I'm still hungry,         
  but there's no more food.     

428
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:50,688
I guess I'll just have to eat   
      the whole planet!         

429
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,290
            ( gasp )            

430
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,859
 It's time to purge this party. 

431
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,296
          ( groaning )          

432
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,032
       Hey, <i> two </i> pairs         
        of wet socks!           

433
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,800
    I'm outta here.             

434
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,371
           Because              
  I'm ridiculously apathetic    

435
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,041
 to the suffering of others,    
       I'm leaving too.         

436
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,743
     Gentlemen, gentlemen!      

437
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,779
              Wow.              

438
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,081
        I really made           
      a mess of things.         

439
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,753
        There's no way          
I'm poopin' out on <i> this </i> party.

440
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,121
            Ahchoo!             

441
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,724
                 Um, sweetheart,

442
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,994
          I perhaps             
  got a little carried away.    

443
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,964
     And I may have been        
   a little inconsiderate.      

444
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:37,235
I guess that's why your mother  
threw me out in the first place.

445
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,070
      I'm sorry, you guys.      

446
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,372
       And you'll patch         
     things up with Mom?        

447
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,907
                     Definitely.

448
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,175
            Hugs!               
            Hugs!               

449
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,910
    What are you gonna do       
         with Helios?           

450
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,980
      Ooh, after party!         
      Where we gonna go?        

451
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,917
   I have no idea, but I'll     
   give you a ride! Ha ha!      

452
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,419
          Tally-ho!             
     ( Helios screaming )       

453
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,989
   Hole in one! Ha ha ha ha!    

454
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,991
     I'll send my top serfs here

455
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,526
      to make everything        
       better than new.         

456
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,594
                 Farewell.      

457
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,796
          Bye, Dad.             
             Bye.               

458
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,466
Whew. From now on, I'll always  
     give you a heads-up.       

459
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:12,236
Thanks, but a surprise is good  
    every once in a while.      

460
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,271
Wouldn't you agree?             

461
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,438
                  Ah!
