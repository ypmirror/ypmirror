No more math.                   

21
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,820
 Trying to find someone to give 
  me a ride to summer school.   

22
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,989
        So, I was, like,        

23
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:59,391
   "Look, Principal Skeeves,    
    I'll start wearing pants

00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,693
           when you start

25
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,263
               Know what I mean?

26
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:08,600
          ( laughter )          

27
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,169
               Okay, don't move.

28
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,508
         Aw, I dropped it again.

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,777
                 ( yells )

00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,619
   Hey, Marco,                  
  whatcha doin'?                

32
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,055
              Jackie, can I     
              ask you something?

33
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:33,459
    Why are all these people    
acting like everything's normal?

34
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,294
'Cause everything's normal.     

35
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,463
Mm, you should try those.       

36
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,564
They're delicious.              

37
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,599
                You know what?  
                You can have it.

38
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,234
                    I can't eat.

39
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,802
                My gut's... ugh.

40
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,704
                    All... blah.

41
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,439
           You know what I mean?

42
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,809
Is this all 'cause              
you're embarrassed              
of your parents?                

43
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,612
        Oh... oh... oh.         

44
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,715
        That's certainly        
    not helping, but... no.     

45
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,051
                      Ugh!      

46
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,821
               Everything's just
               all super weird  
               with Star.       

47
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,724
              I just want things
              to be normal.     

48
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,292
You're having                   
a Marco moment.                 

49
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,560
          Uh, yeah, I'm         
          having a Marco moment.

50
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,395
                       Ha, yeah.

51
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,397
All right, well,                
you can tell me                 
all about it                    

52
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,732
on the way                      
to the kitchen.                 

53
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,567
                I want some more
                of these little 
                hot dogs.       

54
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,145
              No.               

55
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,746
       ( inhales deeply )       

56
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,615
           Be classy.           

57
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,316
Hello, friends.                 

58
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,118
        What's up, Star?        
        You having fun?         

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,687
Oh, yeah.                       
Totally.                        

60
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,956
     Hmm.                       

61
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,125
        I just realized,        
 I have to go to the bathroom.  

62
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,694
          - Oh, uh...           
   - You two talk for a sec.    

63
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,697
                  Be right back.

64
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,766
             Um...              

65
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,601
    ( both talking at once )    

66
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,136
         - Oh, sorry.           
         - No, please.          
         You go first.          

67
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,638
               What did you say?

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,373
( nervous laughter )            

69
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,108
You look well.                  

70
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,976
                   Oh, thanks.  

71
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,978
              I brushed my hair.

72
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,314
Well, great                     
catching up.                    

73
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,983
            Yeah. See ya around.

74
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,785
                      Buddy.    

75
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:10,289
      ( forced laughter )       

76
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,857
  Whatever.                     

77
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,192
       ( both groaning )        

78
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,627
              Man!              

79
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,596
     Aww.                       

80
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,799
           ( groans )           

81
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,970
    So, yeah, those are         
    basically all of the reasons

82
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,638
               why I will be    
               the most reliable

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,807
                non-flaky       
                girlfriend ever.

84
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,809
      - ( phone buzzing )       
      - I gotta go. Sorry.      

85
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,544
Huh? Hey!                       

86
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,146
   Here are the four lobsters   
    the young lady ordered.     

87
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,814
         ( shrieking )          

88
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,116
       ( phone buzzing )        

89
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,027
       ( phone buzzing )        

90
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,730
                Need a time out.

91
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,099
    Something just came up.     

92
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,667
Cool. Later, Kelly.             

93
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,902
              See you next week.

94
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,204
           ( sighs )            

95
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,839
( heavy breathing )             

96
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,108
              Whoa, Starfan13,  
              you got here fast.

97
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,277
           I was here           
        the whole time.         

98
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,785
           ALL: Eww!            

99
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,924
       WOMAN:<i> Welcome to</i>        
        <i> Britta's Tacos.</i>        

100
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,126
     <i> May I take your order?</i>    

101
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,861
     Time to rise and dine!     

102
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,168
        Uh, who are you?        
  Please don't take my organ.   

103
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,404
          Queen Moon?           

104
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,906
          What are you          
          doing here?           

105
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,141
         Give me that.          

106
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,276
      Where's Glossaryck?       

107
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,278
          Glossaryck?           

108
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,913
         Um, he's gone.         

109
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,748
           ( gasps )            

110
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,919
    So now, Marco and I can     
    barely make eye contact     

111
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,688
     because of Roberiot's      
           dumb song.           

112
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,123
 I mean, Marco actually thinks  
     I have a crush on him.     

113
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,825
    ( hysterical laughter )     

114
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,761
        Yeah, but like,         
       don't you, though?       

115
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,930
           What?! No!           

116
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,799
      - Okay, maybe once.       
          - ( gasps )           

117
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:34,866
      But I don't anymore.      

118
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:35,967
                      Aww.      

119
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,103
          I just think          
        he's kinda cute.        

120
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,938
     I think lots of things     
           are cute.            

121
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,873
       Puppies are cute,        
       kitties are cute,        

122
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,141
    tiny peppers are cute--     

123
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,509
Star, it's cool.                

124
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,111
     We believe you.            

125
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,780
       I just want things       
     to go back to normal.      

126
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,615
       What if they never       
           do, Kelly?           

127
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,551
     What if they never do?     

128
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,986
          Girl, don't freak out.
          Maybe you two just    
          need some space.      

129
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,956
              Like me and Ted,  
              we're on our third
              break this week.  

130
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,158
         Come on, Star.         
         Let's ditch this place,

131
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,961
        and go to the party     
        the bad kids are having.

132
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,796
                I heard it's    
                super dangerous.

133
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,666
    Oh! Star, you know what?    
        You love danger.        

134
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,800
         That is true.          

135
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,536
        Boom, you're in.        
           Let's go.            

136
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,206
       What do you mean,        
           he's gone?           

137
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,640
        What did you do         
           with him?            

138
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,142
     I didn't do anything.      

139
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,478
      Glossaryck showed me      
  something in the spell book,  

140
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,681
     and next thing I know,     
  I wake up, and they're gone.  

141
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,483
          Oh, come on.          
      You stole the book.       

142
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,752
       Well, well, well,        
        Glossaryck said         

143
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,387
     the book is mine now.      

144
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,055
      How's that stealing?      

145
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,424
       And I think we can       
           all agree,           

146
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,359
   Glossaryck comes and goes    
         as he pleases.         

147
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,894
         - That's true.         
            - Yeah.             

148
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,996
And I suppose                   
it's just a coincidence         

149
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,098
that you've taken up            
shelter here                    

150
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,367
        in this ancient         
        monster temple.         

151
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,336
     I'm supposed to know that? 

152
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,004
     This place was empty,      
         so I moved in.         

153
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,673
         It's cold out there.   

154
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,876
    I'm wearing a chip bag,     
         for corn sake.         

155
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,577
What about your wand?           

156
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,679
You have half my family's       
crystal embedded in it.         

157
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,681
                 It doesn't even
                 work anymore.  

158
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,583
                If it's yours,  
                you can have it.

159
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,185
            Face it.            

160
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,622
       You've got nothing       
             on me.             

161
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,524
             All right, this is 
             getting us nowhere.

162
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,792
                Time for Plan B.

163
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,093
           No. Wait.            

164
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,961
      No, we need to find       
          Glossaryck.           

165
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:15,867
            Oh, I...            

166
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,070
    I saw your family, Ludo.    

167
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,039
           My family?           

168
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,142
     Let me tell you about      
           my family.           

169
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,512
           ALL: Wow!            

170
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,285
     "See me after class."      

171
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,720
     See this after class,      
          Mr. Kimball.          

172
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,622
     Oh, burning homework.      

173
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,291
         So dangerous.          

174
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,425
         Is that legal?         

175
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,327
Don't worry.                    

176
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,728
It's a controlled burn.         

177
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,297
This is pretty cool, right?     

178
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,998
Janna's having                  
a good time.                    

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,967
                Burn, burn.     

180
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,669
             Yeah.              

181
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,671
          Oh, come on, B-Fly,   
          you need to loosen up.

182
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:56,575
      Here. Throw this math quiz
      into the fire.            

183
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,179
         Yeah, I don't          
         feel anything.         

184
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,915
        You guys were so awesome
        to bring me here,       

185
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,417
but I just don't think          
I'm in a party mood.            

186
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,953
          No. I'm not like that.

187
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,489
   You guys stay and have fun   
   with your controlled burn.   

188
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,957
          I'll see you          
       back at my place.        

189
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,391
            - Star.             
            - Huh?              

190
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,096
                  Is that you?  

191
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,265
  Um... yeah. Maybe.            

192
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,333
Do I know you?                  

193
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,768
                It's me, Oskar. 

194
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,872
                I got a haircut.
                Check it out.   

195
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,974
             Oskar?             

196
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,676
              You're not leaving
              already, are you? 

197
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,545
     Uh...                      

198
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,047
          - Oh, yeah.           
          - He's cute.          
          - Go for it.          

199
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,250
( nervous laughter )            

200
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,523
                  Hey, what are 
                  we staring at?

201
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,391
Oh, nothing.                    

202
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,560
Just thinking about,            
uh, stuff.                      

203
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,896
            Marco, it's         
            the end of the year.

204
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,565
           We don't have to     
           think about anything!

205
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,967
       ( both laughing )        

206
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,803
         Let's only think about 
         you, me, and what we're
         gonna do this summer.  

207
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,139
                  Now, what am  
                  I thinking    
                  right now?    

208
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,374
    Uh...                       

209
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,110
                 Come on, Marco.
                 Read my mind.  

210
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,180
      Imagine all the time      
           we'll save           

211
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,016
      if we learn to read       
      each other's minds.       

212
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,818
             Mmm...             

213
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,387
    You want me to kiss ya?     

214
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,422
                       Um, no.  

215
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,025
          I just wanted you to  
          feed me pizza nuggets,

216
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:23,061
       but hey, good first shot.

217
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,430
             Now go get us      
             some pizza nuggets.

218
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,169
         Hello. Welcome         
         to the world.          

219
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,939
                    Oh, Marco,  
                    how are you?

220
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,340
   Feelin' pretty great, Dad.   

221
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,841
        Oh, that's good.        

222
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,610
          Hey, where's          
     your partner in crime?     

223
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,679
          Oh, Jackie?           

224
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,113
         I guess we are         
     pretty good partners.      

225
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,782
          Star, Marco.          

226
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,550
   I was talking about Star.    

227
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,953
             - Oh.              
    - Jackie is no criminal.    

228
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:51,556
              Star, however, now
              she's a criminal. 

229
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,592
                 I haven't heard
                 any explosions 

230
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,628
                or magic sounds.
                Is she okay?    

231
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,229
          Well, uh...           

232
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,565
     things are a bit weird     
     between us right now.      

233
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,967
            What could be weird?

234
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,202
                 Two teenagers  
                 sharing a home.

235
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,605
              One boy, one girl.

236
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,107
                     Oh. Oh, no.

237
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,142
   Well, if things are weird,   

238
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,978
                it's always good
                to talk it out. 

239
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980
              I feel great      
              talking right now,

240
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,749
    - and I don't even          
    have a problem.             
    - Thanks, Dad.              

241
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,151
           - Now, go.           
           Get out.             
           - What?              

242
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,987
             I have to make     
             more pizza nuggets.

243
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,322
             - Oh.              
            - Leave!            

244
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,625
         Oh, and then,          
      and then, and then,       

245
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,227
       when I was, like,        
        five years old,         

246
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,162
      my big brother Chudo      
      was walking me home       

247
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,631
         from the park,         

248
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,499
       and he stopped at        
 this old, burned-down castle,  

249
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,003
 and he said, "Well, looks like 
     the house burned down.     

250
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,105
       Guess we've got to       
       live outside now"        

251
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,773
       That must've been        
           difficult.           

252
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:45,243
       But I do know that       
       Dennis misses you.       

253
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,612
         He says hello.         

254
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,180
           How is he?           

255
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,316
              He's worried about
              his big brother.  

256
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,952
                    And so am I.

257
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,186
  Worried about me?             

258
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,188
Don't you get it?               

259
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,259
I lost my army,                 
my kingdom, my clothes.         

260
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,462
And look, still standing.       

261
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,197
                Yes, but for    
                how much longer?

262
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,700
                  You don't look
                  well, Ludo.   

263
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,201
                  Tell me what's
                  going on,     

264
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,570
                 and maybe I can
                 help you.      

265
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,508
     So I haven't seen you      
     at school in a while.      

266
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,209
            Yeah, I dropped out,

267
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,111
             to pursue my music.

268
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,214
Oh, you just gonna              
play that right now?            

269
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,550
         ( synthesized          
       rock music plays )       

270
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:47,839
           You think maybe it'll
           end up on Mars?      

271
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,641
Oh, I don't know.               

272
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:52,010
I mean, Mars is                 
pretty far away.                

273
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,078
            What are you saying?

274
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,013
          Oh, no, no.           

275
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,682
         I mean, yeah.          
          Yeah, maybe.          

276
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,317
       Maybe. Maybe it'll       
        end up on Mars.         

277
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,320
          See, Star, that's what
          I like most about you.

278
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,223
                 You always     
                 believed in me.

279
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,258
Oh, no, I...                    

280
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,527
I always do that wrong.         

281
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,529
You know, that                  
fist punchy thingy.             

282
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,331
     What are you talking about?

283
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,267
          You can't do it wrong.
          Just do what you feel.

284
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,538
Is this okay?                   

285
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,807
          Glossaryck?           

286
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,277
                   Glossaryck?  

287
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,145
      Glossaryck!               

288
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,748
          Glossaryck.           

289
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,349
                   Tell me where
                   he is!       

290
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,284
        - ( squeaking )         
        - You're a liar!        

291
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,253
          ( bleating )          

292
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,231
          ( bleating )          

293
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,265
           You found Glossaryck?

294
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,467
          ( bleating )          

295
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,902
                          Blank!

296
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,904
That's not                      
the real book.                  

297
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,973
        ( all gasping )         

298
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,979
            ( evil laughter )   

299
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,221
       - Ludo.                  
       - Ludo's not here        
       right now.               

300
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,857
       But if you'd like,       
    you can leave a message.    

301
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,364
       You did not wanna        
     do that, little man...     

302
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,205
That's it.                      

303
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,902
   You can't keep doing that,   
          Chancellor.           

304
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,840
            Get him!            

305
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,633
       ( weak bleating )        

306
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,468
        Chancellor! No!         

307
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,072
Hello, Moon.                    

308
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,741
       It's been a while.       

309
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,777
            Toffee.             

310
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,719
           ( yells )            

311
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,953
     ( laughs )                 

312
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,801
Tell Star...                    

313
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,605
   I'm coming for my finger.    

314
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,477
           So you just say stuff
           and magic comes out? 

315
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,413
Yeah, pretty much.              

316
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,081
I've even been creating         
my own spells.                  

317
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,417
          - Wanna see?          
    - Yeah, I'd be honored.     

318
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,452
   Okay, I haven't practiced    
       this one too much,       

319
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,322
        so if your body         
  explodes, whoops-a-doopsies!  

320
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,491
        That's a little         
      magic joke for you.       

321
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,895
                 Oh.            
         ( laughs nervously )   

322
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,797
        Okay.                   
        ( inhales )             

323
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,399
         Sparkle kitten         
       fireworks shower!        

324
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,172
   Whoa! It's beautiful.        

325
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,341
  Wow. What wonderful colors.   

326
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,409
       Hey, what's that?        

327
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:22,413
       ( cats screeching,       
        people yelling )        

328
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,952
Geez, I gotta stop              
making cats.                    

329
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,954
                   ( laughs )   

330
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,090
          Seriously, how have we
          not hung out before?  

331
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,759
       Well, I'm usually        
          pretty busy,          

332
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:35,860
       fighting monsters        
           and stuff.           

333
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,795
         Oh, yeah, with         
          your buddy.           

334
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,364
        What's his name?        

335
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,199
             Mango.             

336
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,601
                It's always just
                you and Mango.  

337
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,802
           Oh, Marco.           

338
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,637
            Yeah. Where's Mango?

339
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,607
    Well, Mango's going out     
        with Jackie now,        

340
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,610
     so he'll probably have     
 less time to hang out with me. 

341
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,479
  Well, I'm not doing anything  
          this summer.          

342
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,180
    I'd make a great Mango.     

343
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,949
           Oh, uh...            

344
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,784
             Yeah.              

345
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,552
( siren blaring )               

346
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,488
      This is the police.       

347
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,857
   You punks better be having   
    a study group up there.     

348
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,525
        I've never read         
       a book in my life.       

349
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,962
           That's it,           
   I'm calling your parents.    

350
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,397
     Everybody, run for it.     

351
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,368
            - Whoa.             
          - Hey, Star.          

352
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,070
              I had a great time
              tonight.          

353
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,339
     I think we could have      
     an awesome summer together.

354
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,074
      ( nervous laughter )      

355
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,709
    - Yeah, maybe we could.     
       - Give me a call.        

356
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,344
           Good-bye.            

357
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,678
Good work, Star.                

358
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,347
    Great work.                 

359
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,848
That's some                     
fine work.                      

360
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,550
                  You gals stop.

361
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,053
  You know, maybe this summer   
    thing won't be that bad.    

362
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,355
           We're off to a pretty
           great start already. 

363
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,591
     Yeah. I guess there's      
just one thing to take care of. 

364
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,063
         Again.                 

365
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,498
        All right, Star,        
       let's get awkward.       

366
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,667
                Okay, now do me.

367
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,936
Uh, hey, Marco.                 
Got a sec?                      

368
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,539
  Star?                         

369
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,907
         - I have to...         
       - We need to talk.       

370
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,875
   ( both chuckle nervously )   

371
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,911
Let's go somewhere              
more quiet.                     

372
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,113
Okay.                           
( inhales deeply )              

373
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:06,384
Marco, I know things            
have been "different."          

374
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,952
         "Definitely different."

375
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,455
I wanted to talk to you         
after Song Day,                 

376
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,457
but I feel like                 
we've been avoiding             
each other.                     

377
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,525
             Oh, I've definitely
             been avoiding you. 

378
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,394
Yeah, me, too.                  

379
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:20,465
I guess I just felt             
scared that everything          
would change,                   

380
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,034
and that you didn't             
wanna be friends anymore,       

381
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,702
and I miss the way              
things used to be,              

382
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,771
         - and, and...          
            - Star.             

383
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,573
       I miss the way things    
          used to be, too.      

384
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,541
           ( gasps )            
            You do?             

385
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,643
                 Yeah. You're   
                 my best friend.

386
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,547
             But... but do you  
             have a crush on me?

387
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,716
   Uh...                        

388
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,385
    No. I don't.                

389
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,887
         But the song.          

390
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,589
    Marco, you're my friend,    

391
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,958
and I just wanna have           
an awesome summer               

392
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,559
with my friend.                 

393
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,395
           - Friend?            
           - Friend.            

394
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,667
     Well, maybe let's just     
 forget Song Day ever happened. 

395
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,403
What's a Song Day?              
That sounds like                
a terrible day.                 

396
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,105
          ( chuckles )          

397
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,574
  You know, I think we deserve  
       a couple of months       

398
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,577
         where we just          
       don't do anything.       

399
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,845
       That sounds great.       

400
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,780
   Star, it's called summer,    

401
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,516
                  and it's gonna
                  be great.     

402
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,719
          ( whispers )          
             Great.             

403
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,663
    - How did this get here?    
            - Star!             

404
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,832
          Demon! Mom?           

405
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,101
                What... what are
                you doing here? 

406
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,803
I don't have time               
to explain, but                 
suffice it to say,              

407
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,105
we are in danger.               

408
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,541
We must leave for               
Mewni immediately.              

409
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,676
                  What? Mom, no.

410
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,779
             No, no, no, no, no,
             no, no, no, no. No!

411
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,981
Yes, I'm afraid you have        
no choice in the matter.        

412
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,651
               You sent me here,
               and I didn't     
               have a choice,   

413
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,686
            and now, you're just
            telling me to leave?

414
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,488
Star, this                      
is different.                   

415
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,857
     Mom, I've learned that     
  I get to make choices here.   

416
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,694
    - I chose to fix things     
    with Marco.                 
    - Star.                     

417
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,797
   - I'm choosing to have       
   a crush on Oskar, I guess.   
   - Star.                      

418
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,699
     And apparently, there's    
     this thing called "summer,"

419
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,401
     - where you just don't     
     go to school.              
     - Star.                    

420
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,036
             So I'm choosing    
             to stay here with--

421
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,871
       - Star!                  
       - I'm not changing       
       my mind.                 

422
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,306
            - Star!             
            - What?!            

423
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,808
Toffee has returned.            

424
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,747
    No. No, no, no, no, no.     

425
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,549
I'm sorry,                      
Star,                           

426
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,251
but you need                    
to leave.                       

427
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,754
           ( sighs )            
      I need two minutes.       

428
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,561
             ( shouting ) Marco!

429
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,762
                 Loud.          

430
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,567
            - Star?             
   - Marco, we need to talk,    

431
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,369
             just one last time.

432
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,239
Is everything okay?             
You shouted pretty loud.        

433
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,773
Everybody's just                
staring at us.                  

434
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,008
                Yeah, I know.   

435
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,743
              But some stuff    
              just came up,     

436
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,211
            and I've only got   
              a little time.    

437
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,113
Wait. We got                    
the entire summer.              

438
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,715
           Marco, I don't know  
           how to tell you this,

439
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,850
       - because you're         
       my best friend...        
       - Star?                  

440
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,919
           and that makes this  
           super weird because--

441
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,121
        - What's wrong?         
         - Because I...         

442
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,626
                 I... I do have 
                 a crush on you.

443
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:04,262
       - ( all gasping )        
       - Who called it?         
       I called it.             

444
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,696
       Boom. I called it.       

445
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,465
                I didn't want to
                admit it,       

446
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,467
        because I know you      
        don't feel the same way,

447
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,869
         and I thought if I just
         pretended the feelings 
         weren't there,         

448
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,872
               they'd go away,  
               but they haven't.

449
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,208
          I have to leave Earth,
          probably forever,     

450
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,210
       and I couldn't go        
 without telling you the truth. 

451
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,879
             Uh...              

452
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,881
           - I, uh...           
     - ( crying ) Good-bye!     

453
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,417
             Good-bye, everyone!

454
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,985
             Star!              

455
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,287
                            Hey!

456
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,658
      What do you mean...       

457
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,725
             Star?
