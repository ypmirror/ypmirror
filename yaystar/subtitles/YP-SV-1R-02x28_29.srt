20
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,887
           Oh, okay.            

21
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,855
         Uh-huh. Okay.          

22
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,957
                    ( crashing )

23
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,659
     You know what, Jackie?     

24
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,795
      Can I call you back?      

25
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:06,331
Look, Star, this is             
a stressful situation,          
I get that.                     

26
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,267
But would it kill you           
to slow down for a second?      

27
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,235
You're going                    
kinda overboard.                

28
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,704
   I mean, do you really need   
  to pack this vintage laptop   

29
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,673
       and this purple-y,       
       bubbly tea thingy?       

30
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,575
   ( typewriter bell dings )    

31
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,343
       Why don't you try        
   some breathing exercises?    

32
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,846
       I don't have time        
          to breathe.           

33
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,082
             ( straining )      

34
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,718
      I can't waste a... second.

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,854
      ( frustrated yell )       

36
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,058
Need some help there?           

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,762
       No. I am a strong,       
 independent warrior princess.  

38
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,101
       At the very least,       
you should give your mom a call.

39
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,036
Someone has to fill her in.     

40
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,105
         No, you cannot         
        call my mother.         

41
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,941
      She'd kill me if she      
     found out about this.      

42
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,876
      Ludo stole my book.       

43
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,845
      He took Glossaryck.       

44
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:55,647
       I made this mess.        

45
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,052
           And I'm gonna be     
      the one who cleans it up. 

46
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,621
  "And so, Brave Sir Croakian   

47
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,791
  banished the wicked Mewmans   
         from the land.         

48
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,392
       From that day on,        

49
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,795
      the monsters had all      
   the corn they could eat."    

50
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,631
          Told you your backpack
          was too heavy.        

51
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,766
Buff Frog, I need to know       
where Ludo's hiding.            

52
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,068
I think he's planning           
something big.                  

53
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,971
Yes, I know.                    
Did you not get my letters?     

54
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,906
            Letters?            
        You mean these?         

55
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,942
      I thought the babies      
    were sending us fan art.    

56
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,278
        Seriously. Who writes   
        warning notes in crayon?

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,081
Oh, so I not go to school       
for learn fancy handwriting.    

58
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,749
       Sorry.                   

59
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,354
I make this map                 
when I infiltrate Ludo's lair.  

60
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,656
I mark secret entrance here.    

61
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,358
        Thank you, Buff Frog.   

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,660
            This is exactly     
             what we need.      

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,735
      ( sheepish chuckle )      
     Uh, double thank you.      

64
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,737
You do not need                 
big pack.                       

65
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,706
             - Hey!             
       - Only need wand.        

66
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,385
              Hmm.              

67
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,721
              Huh.              

68
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,392
              Huh?              

69
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,133
                   Heh.         

70
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,245
         Cupcake Blast!         

71
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,481
         Tiara Tornado!         

72
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,825
  Stardust Daisy Devastation!   

73
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,896
        ( all groaning )        

74
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,464
        - Where's Ludo?         
            - Ludo?             

75
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,032
               Don't you play   
               dumb with me.    
               I know he's here.

76
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,901
  Hey, guys, I know it's late,  

77
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,036
       but we gotta make        
  a chore chart or something.   

78
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,173
     This shower is grody.      
            Oh, no.             

79
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,841
           Violence.            

80
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,476
     What is going on here?     

81
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,245
              We're not         
              fighting monsters.

82
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,780
               We're alternative
               monsters.        

83
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,083
         Then what's up         
     with all the weapons?      

84
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,285
              We found them here
              when we moved in. 

85
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,787
   They're perfect for tearing  
   fashionable holes in clothes.

86
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,758
                You're one of us
                now, dude.      

87
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,461
       This place really        
         is abandoned.          

88
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,430
            ( groans ) This was 
            all a waste of time.

89
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,766
              Poor Glossaryck.  

90
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,469
  Who knows what horrible things
  Ludo's doing to him?          

91
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,237
Well, you tried.                

92
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,940
And now we can                  
both agree it's                 
time to call your mom--         

93
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,242
       For the last time, Marco,
       we're not calling my mom.

94
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,811
Whoa, hey,                      
calm down.                      

95
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,047
You're not seeing               
the situation clearly.          

96
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,316
              Seeing clearly?   

97
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,451
                   That's it.   

98
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,453
               I'll use         
               the spying spell.

99
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,789
Since when do you know          
a spying spell?                 

100
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,558
                   Uh... since  
                   I learned it.

101
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,794
              A while ago.      
              You weren't there.

102
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,229
                   And I need to
                   do it alone. 

103
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,964
                No distractions.

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,268
Nice jeans, dude.               
Can I dye them for you?         

105
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,870
                    Hard pass.  

106
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,976
  I summon the all-seeing eye   

107
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,812
         to tear a hole         
         to let me spy.         

108
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,814
           Or was it            
         "in the sky"?          

109
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,819
      Ow. That wasn't it.       

110
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,021
             Ahem.              

111
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,457
  I summon the all-seeing eye.  

112
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,460
           ( yells )            

113
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,096
              Eww.              

114
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,198
  I summon the all-seeing eye   

115
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,002
         to tear a hole         
         into the sky.          

116
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,471
          Reveal to me          
     that which is hidden.      

117
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:43,909
          Unveil to me          
       what is forbidden.       

118
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,588
       What? Oh, not you.       

119
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,225
    Ew! No, no, no, no, no.     

120
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,227
           ( gasps )            

121
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,430
     Janna. You scoundrel.      
              No!               

122
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,265
              No!               

123
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,201
      Ugh. Definitely no.       

124
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,003
            - Marco!            
            - Sorry.            

125
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:17,642
          Concentrate.          
   Concentrate on Glossaryck.   

126
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,920
          ( moaning )           

127
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,288
          Glossaryck!           

128
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,290
          Don't worry.          
   I'm coming to rescue you.    

129
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,626
     ( moaning continues )      

130
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,561
        Is that pudding?        

131
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,530
    A whole tub of pudding.     

132
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,900
      - Where are you?          
      - In flavor heaven.       

133
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,301
        No, physically,         
         where are you?         

134
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,438
         On the ground.         

135
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,107
       But where are you        
        in the universe?        

136
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,976
           Oh. Right.           

137
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,978
         I'm in a cave          
         on the ground.         

138
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
      Glossaryck, come on.      

139
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,583
        The spying spell        
     doesn't work that way.     

140
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,178
               I have never     
            seen that before.   

141
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,013
         Grab my hand.          

142
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,981
           No can do.           
             Sorry.             

143
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,351
     I belong to the book,      
      and the book belongs      
          to Ludo now.          

144
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,986
        Ludo stole you.         

145
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,355
 Well, that's out of my hands.  

146
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,291
Come on, Glossaryck.            
I can almost reach you.         

147
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,059
Come on.                        

148
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,628
                Yes, you are    
            surprisingly close. 

149
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,098
     Glossaryck, don't you      
      wanna come with me?       

150
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,000
           I thought            
        we were friends.        

151
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,336
            Friends?            

152
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,371
          Well, that's          
     such a simple concept.     

153
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,412
Glossaryck, come on.            

154
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,981
My mom is gonna ground me       
for, like, a thousand years.    

155
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,051
         Yes, probably,         
      but you'll be fine.       

156
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:09,020
        Or not. Anyway,         
   your spell is collapsing.    

157
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,322
        But I need you.         

158
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,091
  Maybe this is what you need.  

159
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,032
          Glossaryck.           

160
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,367
             Star!              

161
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,703
                   Are you okay?

162
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,506
Yeah, my hand's fine.           

163
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,574
        That's not what I meant.

164
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:33,178
Well, Glossaryck                
is no longer on the team.       

165
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,183
         I never really         
         saw Glossaryck as      
         a "team player" anyway.

166
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,186
          Oh, my gosh.          
           It is her.           

167
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,755
We just realized                
you're Star Butterfly.          

168
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,423
               We're your       
             biggest fans.      

169
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,492
          Um, I think           
        you're confused.        

170
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,760
       Monsters hate me.        

171
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,062
     Sure, it's not popular     
          to like you,          

172
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,064
   but we're not about that.    

173
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,034
             Yeah! You're       
             the rebel princess.

174
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,235
        Rebel princess?         

175
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,205
             Yeah. You do things
             your own way.      

176
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,640
                     Like us.   

177
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,642
Please, shoot us                
with a spell.                   

178
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,577
Rip some awesome holes          
in our jeans, something.        

179
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,647
      Um, I guess I could       
        cast something.         

180
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,084
   How about Super Strawberry   
          Shake Quake?          

181
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,088
                    ( laughing )
                    Wow!        

182
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,124
                That is awesome!

183
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,259
Look at this sweet rip.         

184
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,428
         Let's go show the guys.

185
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,064
       Dude, I can't believe    
       we met Star Butterfly!   

186
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,301
So, what now?                   

187
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,771
              Now, I call Mom.  

188
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,844
  So...that's pretty much it.   

189
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,150
        Oh, no, this is         
        really bad, huh?        

190
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,452
          I messed up.          
  I really messed this one up.  

191
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,554
         I am so sorry,         
        Mommy and Daddy.        

192
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,656
             Sweetie, it's...   
                it's okay.      

193
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,758
    But the book of spells,     

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,494
      our family history,       
          is all gone.          

195
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,098
     Don't worry.               
  It's just a book,             

196
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,167
and a little magic man.         

197
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,301
              What matters is   
                you're safe.    

198
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,136
        But isn't there         
       anything I can do?       

199
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,272
              Don't do anything.

200
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,473
              We'll handle this.

201
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,275
             You just sit tight.

202
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,243
      Good night, sweetie.      

203
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,548
     Whoa. That went way better 
          than I expected.      

204
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,251
   Uh, yeah.                    
   I guess so.                  

205
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,121
       You know, you should just
       take your parents' advice

206
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,256
                  and sit tight.

207
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,791
        Right.                  

208
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,493
                     Good night.

209
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,295
                 ( door closes )

210
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,897
         Rebel princess         
       doesn't sit tight.       

211
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,738
   Rebel princess does things   
          her own way.          

212
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,308
      Mega Narwhal Blast!       

213
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,880
          Oh. Mega...           

214
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,384
         Narwhal Blast.         

215
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,299
          Chapter one:          

216
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,703
      Mega Narwhal Blast.       

217
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,175
    Hurry up, Star. I don't     
   want us to miss the cake.    

218
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,543
I wonder what flavor it is.     
I hope it's ogg-berry.          

219
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,278
              That's not a thing
              on Earth.         

220
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,581
  Seriously? Oh, man, you guys  
    are really missing out.     

221
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,186
      I think I'll hold on      
 to my gift until I see Sensei. 

222
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,488
      Don't worry, Marco.       
     There's some room left     

223
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,323
        right... there.         

224
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,625
       ( glass shatters )       

225
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,528
STAR: Whoo! Sensei can really   
throw a par-tee!                

226
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,363
     ( people chattering )      

227
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,365
   Come on, I wanna give him    
     his birthday punches.      

228
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,300
          Be careful.           
          He knows Tan Soo Do...

229
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,268
                        sort of.

230
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,971
                 Hot meat. Hyah!

231
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,673
         I... I caught it.      

232
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,308
Me next.                        

233
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,509
Got it!                         

234
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,612
   This is a henna              
    tattoo, right?              

235
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,548
             Yeah, Henna, Jenna.

236
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,516
               I can do whatever
               name you want.   

237
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,853
            Oh, hey, Sensei.    

238
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:06,257
                Sick move,      
                birthday master.

239
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,259
Yeah, you're Sensei-tional.     

240
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,261
       ( both chuckling )       

241
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,266
     Thanks, guys, but you      
    ain't seen nothin' yet.     

242
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,636
   The great Preston Change-o   
         is performing.         

243
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,879
        You didn't tell me there
        were magic users in     
        this dimension.         

244
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,415
        That's something you    
        wanna let a sister know.

245
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,417
Oh, Preston's not               
a magic user.                   

246
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,853
He's an entertainer.            
He does magic tricks.           

247
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:35,854
      Trouble at my party?      

248
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,423
     No burn chicken.           

249
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,258
      Party on!                 

250
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,727
          ( cheering )          

251
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,462
      Waaahh...                 

252
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,431
                The meat speaks.

253
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,868
                 What?          

254
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,839
        He has arrived.         

255
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,346
       Preston Change-o.        

256
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,949
    Yeah!                       

257
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,284
   Whoa ho!                     

258
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,752
             Okay.              

259
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,957
      Why don't you stick       
 your head in my armpit there?  

260
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,493
             Preston Change-o.  

261
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,630
          ( cheering )          

262
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,632
Neat. Let's get closer.         

263
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,300
          Hold your mole, Marco.

264
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,668
                 That little guy
                 is using magic.

265
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,437
     All right, everybody,      
        watch the rings.        

266
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,007
 ( blowing raspberry )          

267
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,076
    That's not magic.           
    There's a gap in            
    one of those rings.         

268
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,845
   I saw it on TV.              

269
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,980
         You do magic,          
            do you?             

270
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,649
                 You don't wash 
               behind your ears.

271
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,518
               ( giggles )      
               Preston Change-o.

272
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,453
     Ear money.                 

273
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,956
        - Tell your mom         
        I said hi.              
        - Hi, Mom.              

274
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,858
           What do we have here?

275
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
                More dirty ears.

276
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,795
                  Just kidding. 
                  It's a pencil.

277
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,497
Oh, to write with.              

278
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,966
      - Preston Change-o.       
         - ( exclaims )         

279
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,601
             What just happened?

280
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,970
        Did your hat get bigger?
        You are magic.          

281
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,406
      Yes, my dear, that's      
the nature of being a magician. 

282
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,841
And a good day                  
to you.                         

283
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,376
         Marco, that's          
        a real magician.        

284
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,078
      He said so himself.       

285
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,646
                  It's a part of
                  his act.      

286
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,415
             This wasn't an act.
             Look at his hat.   

287
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,483
                  Don't you see?
                  It's taller.  

288
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,352
     Look, Star, I get it.      

289
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,387
      The first time I saw      
       a party magician,        

290
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,822
  I was pretty emotional, too.  

291
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,424
     Now if you don't mind,     

292
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,826
       I'm gonna go enjoy       
      some birthday magic.      

293
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,395
       Mr. Preston, would you do
       a magic trick for me?    

294
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,030
Of course I can,                
Jennifer.                       

295
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,600
First I'll need                 
an ordinary five-dollar bill.   

296
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,735
                Sure. Hey, uh...

297
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,570
              Where's my wallet?

298
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,740
   Are you looking for this?    

299
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,909
       It's your wallet.        

300
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,378
         Whoa. No way.          

301
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,680
 Preston Change-o.              

302
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,683
         - That was...          
        - Hey, hey, hey.        

303
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,452
         What was that?         
       Why is Marco sad?        

304
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,087
   - Marco, why are you sad?    
         - I'm not sad.         

305
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,990
  I merely performed a bit of   
   sleight-of-hand, my dear.    

306
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:55,660
       No way.                  
       You're a real magic user.
       Takes one to know one.   

307
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,896
I already told you,             
I'm a magician.                 

308
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,566
      - What's happening?       
      - He... ( sputters )      

309
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,736
        He did a trick,         
   and these lights came out,   

310
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,905
       and hat... hat...        
          his big hat.          

311
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,140
   Ugh. My mom hired Preston    
        to entertain us.        

312
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,509
    He's just doing his job.    

313
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,612
I'm beginning to sense          
that my magic act               
isn't welcome here.             

314
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,080
             No, no, no, no, no.

315
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,749
               We love it.      

316
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,484
        Let's just bring        
      your act over here.       

317
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,086
            Star, it's not real.

318
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,490
        The point of Earth magic
        is to allow yourself    

319
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,992
      to be entertained by      
      pretending that it's real,

320
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,161
                 just like love.

321
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,729
        Who wants cake?         

322
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,665
   Where's the birthday boy?    

323
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,099
     I'll go look for him.      

324
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,135
            Sensei!             

325
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,604
     Hey, Jeremy, have you      
          seen Sensei?          

326
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,473
       Sensei? Who cares?       

327
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,841
    Nothing matters anymore.    

328
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,512
       Preston Change-o.        

329
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,520
             Hey, wakey-wake,   
             it's time for cake.

330
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,455
      Wait. No more magic?      

331
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,624
       Not until after the cake.

332
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,926
          Then there'll be magic
          for everyone.         

333
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,728
              Yay!              

334
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,229
Stop right there,               
Preston.                        

335
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,598
This is the end                 
of the line, mister.            

336
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,833
Fess up. You're doing           
something to these folks.       

337
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,201
Now tell me                     
what it is.                     

338
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,470
                     All right, 
                     you got me.

339
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,639
               Look, I'm not    
               human, all right.
               I'm a joy sucker.

340
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,674
           - A what?!           
        - A joy sucker.         

341
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:20,478
           Sadly, I can't create
           my own joy.          

342
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,013
             So I suck a bit of 
             the joy from others

343
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,781
       when I perform my tricks.

344
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:26,150
        Think of it, you know,  
        as taking their empties.

345
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,987
    You took a lot more than    
 a little from Sensei just now. 

346
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,023
      Yeah, but that dude       
      really loves magic.       

347
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,058
     He had a lot to spare.     

348
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,727
         You gotta go.          

349
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,496
       But I have a party       
         to entertain.          

350
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,164
       You want the wand?       

351
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,534
            Sensei's been on    
            my wait list since  
            he was a little boy.

352
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:48,172
         At least let him have  
         the satisfaction of    
         seeing my grand finale.

353
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,042
        I mean, his mom paid for
        me to be here, and I    
        kinda owe it to him.    

354
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,044
     You're just gonna suck     
         all their joy.         

355
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,680
    Come on, my hat's full.     

356
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,849
     I don't even have room     
   for any more of their joy.   

357
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,550
      You don't wanna ruin      
    a guy's birthday, do ya?    

358
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,886
All right, fine.                

359
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,022
Do your finale.                 

360
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,790
     But I'm watching you,      
          little man.           

361
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:09,227
     You start to suck joy,     
     and you get the wand.      

362
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,895
             Deal.              

363
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,698
    Promise. No joy sucking.    

364
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,067
           - Say it.            
          - I promise.          

365
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,871
         Be cool, Star.         
       Do it for Sensei.        

366
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,907
        Just keep cool.         

367
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,610
            Hey, isn't this fun?

368
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,612
Yeah, that's                    
one word for it.                

369
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,680
                 Aw, h ere comes
                 the cake stick.

370
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,082
           Everyone!            

371
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,718
   I just wanna thank you all   
         for showing up         

372
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,087
   to my 38th birthday bash,    

373
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,557
   especially the very great    
       Preston Change-o.        

374
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,092
      Because without him,      

375
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,094
      this party would be       
         totally lame.          

376
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,997
Preston Change-o, everybody!    

377
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,669
     ( upbeat music plays )     

378
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,682
        - Whoo hoo hoo!         
             - Sh!              

379
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,983
      Sensei exclaiming )       

380
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,821
            No! Mama, he brought
            the box.            

381
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,757
    How about a little girl     
   from the audience, please?   

382
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,660
             ( yells )          
         Take me, take me!      

383
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:16,928
            My body's your body.

384
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,163
     I've got                   
  my eye on you.                

385
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,998
                Get lost.       

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,701
            This thing is sharp.

387
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,669
             Yeah!              

388
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,938
                 ( laughs )     

389
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,612
           Whatever.            

390
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,696
       Preston Change-o.        

391
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,908
       ( all murmuring )        

392
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,910
What are you doing?             

393
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,645
         Sorry, Sensei,         
      I tried to be nice.       

394
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,780
       Tell 'em, Preston.       

395
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,183
    - Tell 'em the truth        
    about your magic.           
    - All right, okay, fine.    

396
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:15,386
           It's true.           
     I don't do real magic.     

397
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:18,689
  All my tricks are just that.  
            Tricks.             

398
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,925
      I did keep my cards       
         up my sleeve.          

399
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,727
        ( all groaning )        

400
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,763
       The rabbit I pull        
    out of my hat... paper.     

401
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,732
    Oh, man, spoiler alert.     

402
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,734
              These blades      
              aren't even sharp.

403
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,837
What?! I knew I didn't          
feel dismembered.               

404
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,308
Not that.                       
The joy-sucking thing.          

405
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,343
                Oh, yeah, right.

406
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,779
          I suck a little bit   
          of joy from your heads

407
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,848
      every time I do my tricks.
      It's harmless really.     

408
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,716
  No. No, it's not.             

409
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,019
  - I think you broke Jeremy.   
         - ( sobbing )          

410
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,689
    Come on, that kid had       
    no joy in him to begin with.

411
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,724
You still shouldn't             
take their joy.                 

412
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,793
It's theirs.                    

413
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,895
                  You're right. 

414
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,031
                    I am sorry. 

415
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,999
            It's what I do.     
            I can't help myself.

416
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,736
     Oh, who cares?             
     That girl just             
     ruined our magic show.     

417
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:09,774
       What? Me? No, but he was 
       the one stealing your joy
       and making you sad.      

418
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,143
         You just stole         
         my joy forever         

419
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:15,880
     by making him explain      
    how his tricks are done.    

420
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,182
         I'll never see         
      a magic show again.       

421
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,718
      ( feedback whines )       

422
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,086
                      Happy now?

423
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,854
             I'm a happy guy.   
           He can have my joy.  

424
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,357
               But I helped.    

425
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,893
 Wait. Wait, guys, guys, guys.  

426
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,828
        Is all you want         
         a magic show?          

427
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,064
   ( mimicking )                

428
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,932
Yeah, that's                    
what we wanted.                 

429
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,901
                      ( crying )

430
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,740
   I'm not sure it was worth    
   ruining Sensei's birthday    

431
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,475
    just to be right.           

432
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,510
                 No, you weren't
                 right, Star.   

433
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,813
        Preston's birthday magic
        was fake.               

434
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,349
Yeah, but I was right           
that Preston was magically      

435
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,251
sucking people's joy.           

436
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,753
       Oh, stop arguing,        
          both of you.          

437
00:20:55,755 --> 00:21:00,258
    You did ruin my birthday    
       magic show, okay?        

438
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,095
       But you're right.        
  That little guy was a creep.  

439
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,298
I don't want nobody             
stealing my joy.                

440
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,470
By my next birthday,            
I'll forget any of this         
ever happened.                  

441
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,405
Magic will be real again.       

442
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,407
     But for now, I'm just      
      gonna be bummed out,      

443
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,142
         and it's okay.         

444
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,312
     I'm glad I didn't get      
  all my joy sucked, you know.  

445
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,981
    Where is Preston anyway?    

446
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,417
      Oh, yeah, I put him       
         in the trunk.          

447
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,752
           - What?              
           - Weirdo.            

448
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,558
        - STAR: No way.         
     - SENSEI: Disappeared.     

449
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,429
