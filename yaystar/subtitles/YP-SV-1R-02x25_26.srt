20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,723
          Hm.                   

21
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,925
       Oh, just eat one already!

22
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,761
There's only ever               
one chip worth eating.          

23
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,563
Besides, if this is             
too boring,                     

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,166
you could be practicing         
your magic.                     

25
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,734
             Fine!              

26
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,570
                 What are we    
                 learning today?

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,572
Why don't you pick one?         
Pick anything.                  

28
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,574
           And my mom would     
          be cool with that?    

29
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,911
    Yes, there's a lot I do     
 that your mom isn't cool with. 

30
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:22,915
  Well, how cool would she be   
           with this?           

31
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,750
       ( evil laughter )        

32
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,385
     The table of contents?     

33
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,020
      A thrilling choice.       

34
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,722
                  Why is that   
                  in the middle?

35
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,192
            - Ehhh?             
         - Pedestrian.          

36
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,527
          - Ehh?                
          - Boring.             
          - ( barks )           

37
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:39,765
           ( laughs )           
       The perfect chip.        

38
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,301
         What's this?!          

39
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,805
         - Oh, no, no.          
   - Hey, you said anything.    

40
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,307
    It's the most dangerous     
      chapter in the book.      

41
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,608
       It shouldn't even        
          be in there.          

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,777
         Your mom would         
       totally freak out.       

43
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,812
Okay, okay,                     
you sold me.                    

44
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,247
       I wanna read that.       

45
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,315
Oh, I don't                     
know, Star.                     

46
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,917
It could taint you.             

47
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,786
         Perfect chip!          

48
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,889
                      Unlock it.

49
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,457
        Hostage-taking.         

50
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,792
       Classic Butterfly.       

51
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,795
       Unlock it or else.       

52
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:13,499
        - You wouldn't.         
          - Uh-uh-uh.           

53
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,234
          Okay, okay.           

54
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,769
Chip.                           
( crunching loudly )            

55
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,238
                 Okay, so...    

56
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,007
     - Yes, yes, but, um...     
             - Hey!             

57
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,109
This wasn't the deal.           

58
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,478
    Oh, well, I'm so sorry.     

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,113
       But you're without       
     your bargaining chip.      

60
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,349
   Fine. I am standing here.    
            Open it.            

61
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,692
  Now, I'm going to show you,   
      for a split second.       

62
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,629
        ( loud buzzing )        

63
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,666
     Bureaucracy of Magic.      
        Yes, this is he.        

64
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,668
    - Tell 'em you're busy.     
     - Kind of a bad time.      

65
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,504
    - Tell 'em you're busy.     
   - Are you listening to me?   

66
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,439
    - You're busy right now.    
   - This is not a good time.   

67
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,675
    This is the worst time.     

68
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,110
  - Star, I'll be right back.   
        - Just hang up.         

69
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,445
      Don't turn the page.      

70
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,214
         ( shrieking )          

71
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,116
        Uh, Glossaryck?         

72
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,992
               ( shrieking )    

73
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,295
    Oh, hi, Mr. Glossaryck.     
              Sir?              

74
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,564
           Sean. Oh.            

75
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,033
    Sorry. The transporter's    
      on the fritz today.       

76
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,168
    But there's free muffins    
         in the lobby.          

77
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,970
       Look, Sean, I was        
  in the middle of something,   

78
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,574
         and it was of          
    ultra cosmic importance.    

79
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,142
Yeah, but you see,              

80
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:34,479
the Magic High Commission       
wants to see you, too, and...   

81
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:39,051
          ( laughing )          

82
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,986
               Uh, is everything
               all right?       

83
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,821
         I don't know.          
    Is everything all right?    

84
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,490
Did you get on the right flight?
     Are you running late?      

85
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,059
        Are you cracked,        
       are you confused?        

86
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,162
       Are you mad?             
      ( blubbering )            

87
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,664
             Oh, Mr. Glossaryck,
             you're so crazy.   

88
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,901
      But you still have        
      to go up and see          
      the Magic High Commission.

89
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,337
Hand me your radio.             

90
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,539
     ( loud blaring sound )     

91
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,874
      Radio's on the fritz, too.

92
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,743
                  You're gonna  
                 have to go up. 

93
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,180
           Very well.           

94
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,350
    Great. Up the elevator,     
    all the way to the top.     

95
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,952
       Wait, wait, wait.        
   No magic in the building.    

96
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,787
      You'll have to walk.      

97
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,422
             Fine.              

98
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,992
Have a magical day.             

99
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,762
          Glossaryck.           

100
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,101
    Glossaryck, Glossaryck,     
          Glossaryck.           

101
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,802
            He is not waking up.

102
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,005
       Time to call Mom.        

103
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,415
        Uh, never mind.         

104
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:47,319
      Please step through       
 the magical detection machine. 

105
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,621
    Oh, come on.                

106
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,157
   Are you carrying any articles
   of magic, sorcery,           

107
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,326
           or occult objects    
           of a mystical nature?

108
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:57,963
           Uh... no.            

109
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,598
     Just step this way, please.

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
          - ( beeps )           
          - Thank you.          

111
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,769
     Okay, Mr. Glossaryck.      
           Your turn.           

112
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,071
       ( alarm blaring )        

113
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,106
         Wait. Hold on.         
        Are you kidding?        

114
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,108
         That other guy         
   just walked right through.   

115
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,443
Technology, right?              

116
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,112
I miss                          
the simpler days.               

117
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,814
            I think             
        we're done here.        

118
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,816
      - Have a magical...       
       - ( alarm sounds )       

119
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,818
  Sean, work with me, please.   

120
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,653
    Cosmic ultra importance.    

121
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,821
           ( beeps )            

122
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,457
      ( alarms sounding )       

123
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,526
      That stays with me.       

124
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,928
Hello. Hold the elevator.       

125
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,033
    Oh, hey, Mr. Glossaryck.    
          Which floor?          

126
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,868
        We've done this.        
           Top floor.           

127
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,813
      Uh, what's going on?      
   The elevator's not moving.   

128
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,048
         Uh, elevator's         
       on the fritz, too.       

129
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,217
             Sorry.             

130
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,286
      But there's muffins       
         in the lobby.          

131
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,721
     Which part of "cosmic      
       ultra importance"        

132
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,055
     do you not understand?     

133
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,957
         ( bell dings )         

134
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,059
          Now we have to stop on
          every floor.          

135
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,028
           ( maniacal laughter )

136
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,564
                 Sean. Stairs.  

137
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,436
       ( exhausted sigh )       

138
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,310
          ( panting )           

139
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,079
    Hey, Star, check it out.    

140
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,315
      I'm getting my first      
          chest hair.           

141
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,717
       It's pretty small,       
     but if you look at it      

142
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,985
   in just the right light...   

143
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,154
    Uh, Glossaryck?             

144
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,522
   What's up with him?          

145
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,923
       He's on the fritz.       

146
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,592
Wait a sec.                     

147
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,061
Are you doing something         
you're not supposed to?         

148
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,029
           Glossaryck said      
           not to turn the page.

149
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:43,368
               But he didn't say
               you couldn't.    

150
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,438
   ( panting and muttering )    

151
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,017
Stairs are                      
on the fritz, too.              

152
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,086
       ( angry groaning )       

153
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,288
Now, now,                       
Mr. Glossaryck.                 

154
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,323
No magic in the building.       

155
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,986
   You're probably wondering    
        why you're here.        

156
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,890
    Children, the only thing    
            I wonder            

157
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,560
   is why you waste my time.    

158
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,962
    Don't call me children.     

159
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,797
      You're the children.      

160
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,133
    I've got chest diamonds     
        bigger than you.        

161
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,301
           Rhombulus.           

162
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,238
    Rhombulus, you still mad    
      about my last visit?      

163
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,082
                    ( bleating )

164
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,652
       Excuse me, sorry.        
     Don't mean to be rude.     

165
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,521
   Getting stronger, though,    
       huh? That's good.        

166
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,756
      You always do this!       

167
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,738
      So you bring me here      
       while I'm at work.       

168
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,544
         Doing my job.          

169
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,114
        Yes, Glossaryck.        

170
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,852
      That's exactly what       
   we're here to talk about.    

171
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,388
           My liege.            

172
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,663
         The commission         
   has discovered a problem.    

173
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,365
      Something somewhere       
 is sapping the power of magic  

174
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,166
             from the universe. 

175
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,369
    Yes, that would explain     
           the fritz.           

176
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,371
                That's what I've
                been saying.    

177
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,172
    Hey, the time-out corner    
      is not on the fritz.      

178
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,909
              Stupid Glossaryck.

179
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,477
                Stupid time out.

180
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,146
      Omnitraxus has been       
searching for the leak's cause. 

181
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,148
Omnitraxus, what have           
you learned?                    

182
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,984
     - ( muffled speaking )     
            - Hello!            

183
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,052
             Omni?              

184
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,487
        Can you hear me?        

185
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,189
      - Check the inputs.       
           - You out.           

186
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,326
        Yeah, whatever.         
    I'll crystallize myself.    

187
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,194
Would you miss me? No.          

188
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,764
          ( bleating )          

189
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,933
          Whatever's causing it,

190
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,201
            I want everyone     
            to be on their toes.

191
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,570
                Especially Star.

192
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,338
        I need you to accelerate
        her training.           

193
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,340
          Yeah... no.           

194
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,375
      Why all the riddles?      

195
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,078
  You were always very direct   
   when you were training me.   

196
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,880
   Well, it finally happened.   

197
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:46,217
  Every queen wants to tell me  
       how to do my job.        

198
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,086
  "My training was different."  

199
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,355
         You know what          
       Glossaryck hears?        

200
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,357
        Me-me-me-me-me!         

201
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,192
  "I'm going to pull my mentor  
       away from his job        

202
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,127
         so I can be in         
     the spotlight again."      

203
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,296
       The only Butterfly       
         to leave me be         

204
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,933
   was your great-great-great   
    great-great-great-great     
       great-grandmother,       

205
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,935
            Eclipsa,            
     the queen of darkness,     

206
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,705
 whose chapter, coincidentally, 
    you left Star alone with    

207
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,374
    when you pulled me into     
  this wonderland of red tape.  

208
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,943
         <i> Turn the page,</i>        
         <i> turn the page!</i>        

209
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,979
                 <i> I'm gonna turn</i>
                 <i> the page.</i>     

210
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,647
<i>Turn the page, Marco!</i>           

211
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,649
          ( anguished bleating )

212
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,452
    You all did this because    
      you don't trust me,       

213
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,120
       and what's worse,        
     you don't trust Star.      

214
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,924
      My queen. My queen,       
  your training was different   

215
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,759
   because Star is different.   

216
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,928
 You have to have faith in her  
        to make choices         

217
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,763
     that are best for her.     

218
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,164
                   And my job   

219
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,202
                is to train Star
                to be a queen.  

220
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,642
              Oh!               

221
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,844
             - So?              
            - Yeah.             

222
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,445
You read the whole thing?       

223
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,747
                 Yeah.          

224
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,482
     And?                       

225
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,450
             It wasn't all that.
             I mean, I get it.  

226
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,285
              Power of darkness,
              forces of evil,   

227
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,588
              eternal suffering,
              blah, blah, blah. 

228
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,658
     But honestly, didn't       
     really affect me that much.

229
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,259
    - Just wasn't my thing.     
             - Yes!             

230
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,194
              But Marco,        
              on the other hand.
              Yikes.            

231
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,199
       ( evil muttering )       

232
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,202
                Luckily, there's
                a spell         
                to fix that.    

233
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,008
         Oh, Minnesota.         
             Fancy.             

234
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,211
      Okay, you got this.       

235
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,513
       Today is the day.        

236
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,947
         - Hey, Marco.          
          - ( gasps )           

237
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,383
Today is the day                
for what?                       

238
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,552
                  Oh, uh...     

239
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,788
          Today is the day...   

240
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,189
         I was going to         
      ask you a question.       

241
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,390
             Okay.              

242
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:36,061
    Jackie, I was wondering     

243
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,731
    if you'd like to go out     
  and get me some paper towels  

244
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,133
    for Marco's sweaty pits.    

245
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,570
            - Uh...             
       - No, no, no, no!        

246
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,739
          That is not           
      what I meant to say.      

247
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,507
    What I meant to say is,     

248
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,309
      the sweat is gushing      
       down Marco's back        

249
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,144
      - like a waterfall.       
      - ( nervous laugh )       

250
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,146
  Now it's crossing the border  
      into Marco's undies.      

251
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,347
             Aaaah!             

252
00:11:56,349 --> 00:12:00,218
Okay, well, Jackie              
is going to go now              

253
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,353
and get Marco                   
some paper towels               

254
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,089
for his wet body.               

255
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,490
          ( whimpers )          

256
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,026
    That was so stupid!         

257
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,161
           Hey, hey, now, Marco.

258
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,063
                It's not        
                that big a deal.

259
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,866
I heard what happened.          
Everyone's talking about it.    

260
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,235
Well, looks like you should     
just give up on dating forever. 

261
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,504
           Thanks for           
    the vote of confidence.     

262
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,040
       I'm not gonna let        
   being tongue-tied stop me.   

263
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,008
            Pen me.             

264
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,246
        Jackie, will you        
  go out with me Friday night?  

265
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,115
Hey, uh, Jackie.                

266
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,382
                  Oh, hey,      
                  there you are.

267
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,351
        I got your paper towels.

268
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,853
Oh, uh...                       
( nervous giggle )              

269
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,621
Thanks. Here's                  
some paper for you.             

270
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,857
       "Marco can't grow        
       hair on his chin,        

271
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,625
           but he can           
         on his back"?!         

272
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,293
             - Ha!              
            - What?!            

273
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,262
      ( reading quickly )       

274
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,732
          ( giggling )          

275
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,400
Bro, my jacket.                 

276
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,202
             Oh, sorry, Chet.   

277
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,638
          No worries. It's just 
          a material possession.

278
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,273
Marco thinks Chet               
should punch him.               

279
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,575
         - What?                
         - No, no, no.          
         I mean,                

280
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,612
      if Marco were Chet,       
   he'd totally punch Marco.    

281
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,847
   It's just a jacket, dude.    

282
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,984
Marco would lose                
all respect for Chet            

283
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,719
if Chet didn't                  
punch Marco.                    

284
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,654
     Don't... don't make me     
         do this, bro.          

285
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,324
What happened                   
in there?                       

286
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,093
          I don't know          
       what got into me.        

287
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,427
         Every time I'm         
         around Jackie,         

288
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,396
      I keep blurting out       
        the wrong thing.        

289
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,231
        Every night when        
      Marco goes to sleep,      

290
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,500
he shapes his pillow in the form
     of Jackie Lynn Thomas.     

291
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,935
         and kisses it          
          good night.           

292
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,303
     Did you say something?     

293
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,138
      ( muffled speaking )      

294
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,973
          ( groaning )          

295
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,078
Marco,                          
what's happening?               

296
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,748
                Wait. Let's see 
                where this goes.

297
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,484
    ( anguished screaming )     

298
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,985
        ( all gasping )         

299
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,158
             Hello.             

300
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,127
           ( yelps )            

301
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,529
          Oh, you made          
     a little Marco Junior.     

302
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,331
             'Sup, Marco Junior?

303
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,534
Janna, that's not his hand.     
That's...                       

304
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,936
          Oh, oh, oh.           

305
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,672
  Marco Diaz covers the mirror  
        when he showers,        

306
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,340
   because, because, because,   

307
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,543
    because Marco is ashamed    
        of his own body!        

308
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,845
Oh, it's                        
so adorable.                    

309
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,613
        Are you crazy?!         

310
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,849
      How am I ever gonna       
   ask out Jackie like this?    

311
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,951
          - Hey, guys.          
             - Hey.             

312
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,619
Did any of you get              
the English homework assignment?

313
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,821
        Marco thinks...         

314
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,557
Oh, I can                       
show you, Jackie.               
Come with me.                   

315
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,294
     That's it. I remember      
  where I've seen you before.   

316
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,564
            Hey, where'd you get
            my combination?     

317
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,032
        From your diary.        

318
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,704
                     What is    
                     that stuff?

319
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,372
          Just some of          
      my personal things.       

320
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,242
     I've seen Marco Junior     
       somewhere before.        

321
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,409
                    Stop calling
                    it that!    

322
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,812
       Here. The Naysaya.       

323
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:44,048
    "The Naysay grows out of    
    the neck of its victim."    

324
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,151
       Yes, that is Naysaya     
       when Naysaya was younger.

325
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,387
    "It reveals itself when     
         the afflicted          

326
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,389
        attempts to woo         
        their true love,        

327
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,992
     exposing the victim's      
    deepest, darkest secrets    

328
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,827
       for all to hear."        

329
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,395
            And to judge.       

330
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,063
                  What the heck 
                  is that thing?

331
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,732
JANNA: Oh, that's a demon.      

332
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,600
The Naysaya is                  
a total demon curse.            

333
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,602
           ( groans )           
            A demon.            

334
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,108
             Dude, I'm so sorry.

335
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,576
               I totally put    
               that curse on you

336
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,611
             to prevent you from
             asking out Star.   

337
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,446
Why would you do                
something like that?            

338
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,882
         That was before        
         we started hanging out.

339
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:21,019
  You haven't asked out a girl  
   since the Blood Moon Ball?   

340
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,088
  That's way more embarrassing  
 than that thing on your neck.  

341
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,623
How do I                        
get rid of it?                  

342
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,525
                 Just let it    
                 run its course.

343
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,861
          Once it's shouted     
          all your worst,       
          most shameful secrets,

344
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,429
                 it'll wear off.

345
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,730
And how long                    
will that take?                 

346
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,133
           It depends.          
           How insecure are you?

347
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,768
   Oh, no.                      

348
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,471
                Good luck, dude.

349
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,206
      ( knocking on door )      

350
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,643
STAR: Marco?                    
What did Tom say?               

351
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:49,447
Tom says Marco will have Naysaya
   for the rest of his life,    

352
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,817
   because, because, because    
     Marco is<i> so</i> insecure.      

353
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,486
          You should            
     get back to school.        

354
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,587
     You're missing class.      

355
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,656
 Well, aren't you coming, too?  

356
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,892
              I won't be going  
              to school anymore.

357
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,561
             What?              

358
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,667
        Marco, it's just        
         a demon curse.         

359
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:13,071
   Don't let Naysaya keep you   
      from what you want.       

360
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,773
       ( sighs )                
         Okay.                  

361
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,742
    The door is cutting off     
 the circulation to my finger,  

362
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,578
     so I better get going.     
          Ooh, tingly.          

363
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,682
            She's a good friend.

364
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,351
        All right, dude,        
        what do you want        

365
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:27,652
        what do you want        
    to keep your mouth shut?    

366
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,354
             What?              

367
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,356
       What do you want?        

368
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,659
      Marco wants to know       
      what Naysaya wants?       

369
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,529
      But no one has ever       
   asked what Naysaya wants.    

370
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,299
Well, dude,                     
it's your lucky day.            
What do you want?               

371
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,502
        May Naysaya have        
      whatever he pleases?      

372
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,137
     As long as you let me      
        ask Jackie out,         

373
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,538
          you can have          
       whatever you want.       

374
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,274
   Then Naysaya would like...   

375
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,609
            cereal.             

376
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,312
           Seriously?           

377
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,880
      You can have cereal.      

378
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,682
         But... but...          

379
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,518
       Naysaya would like       
        to enjoy cereal         

380
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,621
    in Naysaya's own mouth.     

381
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,024
             Ahhhh.             

382
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,862
        Will... will...         
         will it hurt?          

383
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,931
Just make sure you chew         
with your teeth.                

384
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,903
           Some more.           

385
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,707
           Some more.           

386
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,477
           Some more!           

387
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,581
      Okay, so you promise      
to keep your mouth shut, right? 

388
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,383
         ( swallowing )         

389
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,852
   Naysaya is in your corner.   

390
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,721
         ( bell rings )         

391
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,290
                That is so cute,
                you guys.       

392
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,829
        ( sighs deeply )        

393
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,931
                    Hey, Jackie.

394
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,666
      Look. Is that Marco?      

395
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,234
              He's going for it.

396
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,904
Hey, Marco.                     
Are you cold?                   

397
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,405
What's going on here            
with the scarf?                 

398
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,208
              Oh, you know,     
              sometimes I...    

399
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,544
              ski to school.    

400
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,712
No way! I snowboard.            
Awesome!                        

401
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,349
  Yeah, yeah, there's probably  
         a lot of stuff         

402
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,218
    you don't know about me.    

403
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,586
      That's why I thought      
        it would be cool        

404
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,589
       if we, uh, if we,        
     if you and I, if we...     

405
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,224
                   went on a... 

406
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,426
          Oh, oh, oh,           
          this is the Jacqueline

407
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,629
   Marco practiced asking out   
       in the mirror. Oh!       

408
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:22,767
 Marco even pretend-kissed you  
  with his own... reflection.   

409
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,936
     Naysaya, you promised      
     you wouldn't do that.      

410
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,705
       What's a promise?        

411
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,307
Look, I gotta go home.          

412
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,376
        You're... you're        
      really confusing me.      

413
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,747
         Jackie, wait!          

414
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,550
              It's not me       
              saying this stuff.

415
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,452
                 It's him.      

416
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,055
    - Greetings, Jacqueline.    
          - ( gasps )           

417
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,424
That is disgusting.             

418
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,426
               Is that          
               a British accent?

419
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,129
    Jackie, there's nothing     
           I can do.            

420
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,998
      Got this curse thing      
          on my neck.           

421
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,767
       But I'd still like       
            to ask--            

422
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,269
   Marco hasn't taken a bath    

423
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,972
          since he saw          
       that shark movie.        

424
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,774
                 He's right.    

425
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,677
     I haven't taken a bath     
 since I saw that shark movie.  

426
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,779
         I mean, I take showers.

427
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,781
              I'm just afraid   
                of the tub.     

428
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,518
          Oh, oh, oh,           
       and Marco wears...       

429
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,319
          I wear ballet shoes   
           around the house.    

430
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,787
   And he never held hands--    

431
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,190
       I never held hands       
          with a girl.          

432
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,325
       - So I practiced         
       with Ferguson.           
       - And, and, and--        

433
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,327
          I always sit          
   when I go to the bathroom    

434
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,196
         What? Come on,         
  there's ladies in the house.  

435
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:28,099
            I cry when it rains.

436
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:31,169
        I still got my wubbie   
        and his name is Esteban.

437
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,771
   Until last week, I thought   
     that the state of mind     

438
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,773
            was between         
            Nebraska and Kansas.

439
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,608
      I'm a straight-A student, 

440
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,378
   and I've still got no idea   
    how to do long division.    

441
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,680
            Go ahead, someone   
            yell out a division.

442
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,782
     BOY: 724 divided by 7.     

443
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,118
               I got no idea.   
               Get a calculator.

444
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,686
        Yes, but Marco--        

445
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,122
             I filled a notebook
             with my first name 

446
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,823
             and your last name,

447
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,992
   because I couldn't decide    
     which looked better--      

448
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,861
    Marco Diaz Lynne Thomas,    

449
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,996
  or Marco Lynne Thomas Diaz.   

450
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,699
       - Oh, oh...              
       - Oh, yeah,              
       and another thing.       

451
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,635
           I kept this drawing  
           you made of the moon.

452
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,537
         I pulled it out of     
         the trash in art class.

453
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,806
That's supposed to be           
a watermelon.                   

454
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,676
              Oh, really?       
              Looks like a moon.

455
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,913
        Well, your watermelon   
        reminds me of my biggest
        fear of all--           

456
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,583
      that we're all alone      
   on this tiny blue marble,    

457
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,085
        floating in the infinite
        expanse of the universe,

458
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,154
         ripped from the center,

459
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,990
           and ejected out      
           into a black void    
           for no reason at all.

460
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,993
      Players on the stage      
         of the absurd.         

461
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:32,330
Wow, that was                   
really... deep.                 

462
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,165
 So there it is, Jackie Lynne.  

463
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,167
           That's it.           

464
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,336
  That's all my insecurities.   
    You know everything now.    

465
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,706
         Unless I left          
         anything out.          

466
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,909
          No, Marco, that's...  

467
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,744
             everything.        

468
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,080
     I still think it'd be      
          really great          

469
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,881
                  if we hung out
                  Friday night. 

470
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,883
                  Whoo!         

471
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,120
You know, a group of us         
are all going to a movie        
Friday night.                   

472
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,788
You should totally come.        

473
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,225
     That would be awesome.     

474
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,395
Cool. Well, see you then.       

475
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,864
You did it, you did it,         
you did it, you did it!         

476
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,966
You did it,                     
you did it!                     

477
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,235
   You know who to call         
   when you get divorced, Marco.

478
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,871
      So, curse fulfilled,      
             right?             

479
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,906
How's this work? You just kinda 
       dry up, flake off?       

480
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:20,778
  You know, Naysaya has never   
      been to the movies.       

481
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,214
              Ah!               

482
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,554
      Don't open the door.      
     It's not the milkman.      

483
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,990
         ( screaming )          

484
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:37,328
    Oh, Marco's very nervous    
           right now.           

485
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,963
        After the movie,        
         you gotta go.
