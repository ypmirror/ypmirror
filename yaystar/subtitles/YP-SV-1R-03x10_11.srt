00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,717
           each year,           
       we hold this dance       

21
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,587
          to celebrate          
     the peace between us.      

22
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,223
           Welcome to           
     the Silver Bell Ball.      

23
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,295
      ( cheering )              

24
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,863
     Whoo hoo!                  

25
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,665
                   Yeah!        

26
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,268
     The rules of the ball      
    are the same as always.     

27
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:14,072
        Each royal heir         
will dance with all the others, 

28
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,708
     representing the bonds     
     between our kingdoms.      

29
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,444
Their kingdom got               
taken over by rats.             

30
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,813
                How could they  
                let that happen?

31
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,616
           Hey, hey,            
      they were big rats.       

32
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,618
Oh, girl,                       
okay, okay.                     

33
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,620
What do you think               
of the line-up?                 
Be honest.                      

34
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,956
            It's just the same  
            bunch of borings    
            as every year, Pony.

35
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,791
            Okay, that's fine,  
            but, like, check out

36
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,559
        Prince Larry Kelpbottom.

37
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,128
                Mm-hmm, okay.   
                Somebody came up

38
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,130
                and hit him with
                a hottie stick. 

39
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,632
     Guess it is kinda cool     
     to see everyone dance.     

40
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,167
     - Hey, Princess Jaggs.     
             - Hey.             

41
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,835
                    Hi, Princess
                    Spider Bite.

42
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,637
    Hello.                      

43
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,672
Oh, look, there's               
your annoying cousin.           

44
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,209
                Yeah. Guess     
                I should say hi.
                Hi, Rock.       

45
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,744
                  Hi, Rock.     

46
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,180
                    Your cousin.
                    Over here.  

47
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,782
        Rock Johansen.          
        Okay, he hasn't changed.

48
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,853
   Oh, looks like Rich Pigeon   
   got himself some new legs.   

49
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,256
Ooh, somebody's                 
missing, Star.                  

50
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,691
               Yep.             
               He's always late.

51
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,760
         This is where          
     you two met, isn't it?     

52
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,661
            Mm-hmm.             

53
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,796
    Drama.                      

54
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,567
   Drama!                       

55
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,471
Drama, drama, drama,            
drama, drama, drama...          

56
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,506
       Pony, no drama this year.

57
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,874
       I told my parents        

58
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,509
      I was gonna focus on      
       the princess biz.        

59
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,044
Oh, come on,                    
you're the bomb                 
at shakin' up                   

60
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,846
these dusty                     
old traditions, girl.           

61
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,681
        - Not this year.        
         - Oh, come on.         

62
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,950
             - No.              
           - Come on.           

63
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,451
                      No, Pony. 
                      Seriously.

64
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,153
Did you not hear me             
when I said come on?            

65
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,222
      - Come on, come on.       
         - I'm serious.         

66
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,791
                        Sh!     

67
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,627
         I've caused a lot      
         of trouble this summer.

68
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,897
              It's time to be   
              a better princess.

69
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,136
            Sunglasses at night.

70
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,871
                   Classy.      

71
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,206
      MANFRED: Announcing       
         the arrival of         

72
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,342
     Prince Thomas Lucitor.     

73
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,710
                 Hey, everybody.

74
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,679
        And his parents,        
     Lord and Lady Lucitor,     

75
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,680
       of the underworld.       

76
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,888
         Hello, Wrathmeelior.   

77
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,990
          - Hi, Dave.           
             - Hey.             

78
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,059
        Will the dancers        
          please stand          

79
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,594
   for the commencement bow?    

80
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,867
          ( gasps )             
          Did you just see that?

81
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,736
Ho ho ho, yes!                  

82
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,938
Ooh, I think                    
the whole room saw that.        

83
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,407
          Girl, you're          
     getting club-snubbed.      

84
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,009
           Oh, no...            
         What is that?          

85
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,845
Oh, I don't know,               
it's just the best way          

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,580
to get someone                  
all up in your business.        

87
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,216
             Watch.             
        Hey, Kelpbottom.        

88
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,851
          Kelpbottom!           

89
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,354
   No, no, not you. Not you.    
       The handsome one.        

90
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,589
           You hear that, honey?
           I'm the handsome one.

91
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,757
           ( snorts )           

92
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,892
        Pony, what the...       
        I thought you liked him.

93
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,728
Oh, I do, I do.                 

94
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,796
But listen, the more            
you ignore somebody,            

95
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,798
the more they fall              
deeply in love with you.        

96
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,767
          That's, like, science.
          It's scientific or    
          something like that.  

97
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,736
( sniffs )                      

98
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,704
   Ugh, okay. Can you please    
      give me some space,       

99
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,206
        'cause I really         
   need that from you, okay?    

100
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,807
           Thank you.           
            Bye-bye.            

101
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,776
     - It works every time.     
            - Weird.            

102
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,146
   Let the first dance begin.   

103
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,049
             Ahem.              

104
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,884
            Anyone?             

105
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,587
            Oh, my.             
     It seems Prince Thomas     

106
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,155
           has taken            
        the initiative,         

107
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,126
      and he appears to be      
 walking towards Princess Star. 

108
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,994
        Star and Thomas         
        have always been        

109
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,964
      the best dancers at       
    every Silver Bell Ball,     

110
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:30,068
    and we all know they had    
 a very tumultuous relationship 

111
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,970
       before breaking up       
           last year.           

112
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,806
           ( groans )           
            Manfred.            

113
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,408
    May I have this dance...    

114
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,476
        Well, all right.        
         Let's do this.         

115
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,845
Princess Jaggs?                 

116
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,414
        ( all gasping )         

117
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,583
                 Uh, yeah, okay.

118
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,852
You look lovely today.          

119
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,988
  What? No, you do.             

120
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,358
                 Well, this is  
                 a surprising   
                 turn of events.

121
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,826
                     No mistake.

122
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,362
              At the previous   
              Silver Bell Balls,

123
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,165
        Tom always chose        
 Princess Star first to dance.  

124
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,276
           Pony, I think I am   
           getting club-snubbed.

125
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,479
Ooh, this is some               
next-level club-snubbing.       

126
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,281
    He wants you bad, girl.     

127
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,983
   Ugh. Tom always does this.   

128
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,652
    When is he gonna realize    
      I'm not interested?       

129
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,955
      Okay, calm yourself,      
           Butterfly.           

130
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,991
       You're a princess,       
       for goodness sake.       

131
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,894
          Oh, it's on.          

132
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,703
                  Hm, let's see,
                  let's see.    

133
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,906
        - I choose you.         
          - ( cooing )          

134
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,075
          Oh, oh, oh!           

135
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,480
       Oh, Princess Star        
 has chosen Prince Rich Pigeon  

136
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,914
  as her first dance partner.   

137
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,317
         Could there be         
     a new romance waiting      

138
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,018
         in the wings?          

139
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,721
                    Oh, Richard.

140
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,823
     I had no idea you were     
      such a good dancer.       

141
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,559
                 ( coos )       

142
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,528
Good job, girl.                 

143
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,996
                Mm-hmm, that    
                oughta show him.

144
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,698
          ( laughing )          

145
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,233
           ( growls )           

146
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,260
      At last, the dancers      
  have completed the ceremony,  

147
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,662
         and are seated         
      with their parents.       

148
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,766
        All except Star         
          and Thomas.           

149
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,067
              They're saving    
              the best for last.

150
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,436
          ( laughing )          

151
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,138
                      Hmm.      

152
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,709
         Come on, Star.         
        Dance with him.         

153
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,048
        May I have this dance...

154
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,450
                 Manfred?       

155
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,018
        ( all gasping )         

156
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:34,986
           Oh, dear.            

157
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,156
           Oh, snap!            
           ( laughs )           

158
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,158
        No one has ever         
       asked me to dance.       

159
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,626
          ( giggles )           

160
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,761
     Ladies and gentlemen,      

161
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,030
       Star has asked me,       
            Manfred,            

162
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,832
      to the dance floor.       

163
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,033
          I feel like           
        I'm in a dream.         

164
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,202
Your daughter just              
club-snubbed my son.            

165
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,038
          Your son's been       
          club-snubbing         
          my daughter all night!

166
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,540
My son                          
is a gentleman.                 

167
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,276
       My daughter is           
     a delicate flower.         

168
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,880
Delicate flower? Let's see      
how delicate a flower you are!  

169
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,316
         - ( arguing )          
        - Unbelievable!         

170
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,119
          No, no, no, no,       
          you do not get to make

171
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,020
            sad eyes at me.     

172
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,722
             This is your fault.

173
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,057
             Look, I still don't
             wanna date you.    

174
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,526
             I have been through
             a lot lately,      

175
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,528
               and what I really
               need is a friend.

176
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,230
            But all you wanna do
            is play your little 
            childish games.     

177
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,064
             Games?             

178
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,233
                Oh, don't act   
                all innocent,   

179
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,635
               you club-snubber.

180
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,738
What? Star, I was there         
on Song Day.                    

181
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,673
I know you're                   
with Marco now.                 

182
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,208
         Oh, Ruberiot.          

183
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,043
  That song is gonna haunt me   
    for the rest of my life.    

184
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,313
No, no. It was                  
a huge wake-up call.            

185
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,048
I finally realized              
you're not into me.             

186
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,517
      So during the dance,      
I wanted to do the right thing, 

187
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,319
      and give you space.       

188
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,054
         If you'd asked         
           to dance,            

189
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,222
   I totally would've, but...   

190
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,190
I wanted it                     
to be your choice.              

191
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,226
      Okay, first of all,       
   me and Marco, not a thing.   

192
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,328
           - Really?            
     - Hey, not the point.      

193
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,263
                 Second of all, 
                 giving me space

194
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,598
         doesn't mean pretending
         I don't exist.         

195
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,266
               That's just rude.

196
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,068
       I was just trying        
     to do the right thing.     

197
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,604
  It would've been nice if you  
  didn't ignore me all night.   

198
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,274
          I don't know          
        how to be nice!         

199
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,543
At least give me                
credit for trying.              

200
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,512
       This wasn't easy.        

201
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,314
           ( yells )            

202
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,118
                You're being    
                really dramatic.

203
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,787
        Whatever, Star.         

204
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,188
       I was just trying        
   to give you what you want.   

205
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,257
    This isn't what I want.     

206
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,529
    KING: Look what you did!    
 You're paying for that chair!  

207
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,897
I'll pay for the chair          
when you pay for                

208
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,532
all the damage                  
Toffee caused.                  

209
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,801
    I'm starting to rethink     
being allies with your kingdom. 

210
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,469
     Oh, why don't you just     
        crawl back into         

211
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,304
        that little hole        
        you came out of?        

212
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,106
       Please, everyone,        
          settle down.          

213
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,908
   ( cooing )                   

214
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,311
              How could they let
              that happen?      

215
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,115
                 Tom, may I have
                 this dance?    

216
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,350
       I'd be delighted.        

217
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,293
             Aw, look at 'em go.

218
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,303
Um, Star?                       

219
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,172
We should probably              
stop dancing.                   

220
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,375
                 Oh, yeah. Yeah.

221
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,647
       And this concludes       
     the Silver Bell Ball.      

222
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,751
       ( loud thumping )        

223
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,526
             Awwww.             

224
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,828
          I forgot what         
          a good dancer you are.

225
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,197
Yeah, thanks.                   

226
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:10,234
So, um, would you               
maybe wanna get                 
a corn shake or something?      

227
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,036
               Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

228
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,404
                I could do that.

229
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,406
Beep beep.                      
Excuse us.                      

230
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,208
Look at me, Star.               

231
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,343
Ooh, it's a new                 
club-snub record.               

232
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,180
          ( laughing )          

233
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,223
       Ready, Glossaryck?       

234
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,425
   - Here comes the airplane.   
  - ( makes airplane noises )   

235
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,526
Globgore, globgore.             

236
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,396
            Come on, Glossaryck.
            Be a good boy.      

237
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,599
          Glossaryck,           
     what have I told you?      

238
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,435
      We express ourselves      
        with our words,         

239
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,070
        not our pudding.        

240
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,740
          - Globgore!           
          - ( gasps )           

241
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,241
        Oh, Glossaryck.         

242
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,576
           Here, boy.           

243
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,044
       - Do you wanna...        
          - Globgore?           

244
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,179
       ...go for a walk?        

245
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,447
           Globgore!            

246
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,283
     Glossaryck, slow down!     

247
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,086
      Globgore, globgore.       
        ( Star yelling )        

248
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,388
                  Glossaryck,   
                  what the heck?

249
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,257
                 Stop that,     
                 bad Glossaryck.

250
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,025
    Are we gonna have to go     
     back into the diaper,      

251
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,293
      'cause I will do it.      

252
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,895
                  ( chittering )

253
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,597
           Globgore!            

254
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,098
        Ah, Glossaryck!         

255
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,901
           Globgore!            
              No!               

256
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,107
        Oh, Glossaryck!         

257
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,709
        Oh, my goodness.        

258
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,310
         I am so sorry          
       about your roses.        

259
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,279
           He... oh!            

260
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,448
           Don't worry.         
           They're just flowers.

261
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,283
          It's not like they're 
          something really cool,

262
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,085
           like a squirrelicorn.

263
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,753
      - Isn't that right?       
          - Globgore!           

264
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,722
Globgore, globgore.             

265
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,290
              Oh!               

266
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,926
      How did you do that,      
    and teach it to me now.     

267
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,895
                      ( laughs )

268
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,296
             He just looked like
             he needed a little 
             head scratch.      

269
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,265
          ( quietly )           
           Globgore.            

270
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,933
                You know,       
                once in a while,

271
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,435
      you've got to slow down   
      and appreciate the feeling

272
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,804
         of a nice head scratch,

273
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,072
         or the smell of        
         a freshly bloomed rose,

274
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,475
          or the taste of       
          a delicious candy bar.

275
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,145
              ( chewing loudly )

276
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,347
          I might have          
   some self-control issues.    

277
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,349
       ( both laughing )        

278
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,584
Yeah, me, too.                  

279
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,320
You seem so familiar.           
We met before, right?           

280
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,490
     Maybe. I used to visit     
       this garden a lot.       

281
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,792
      Oh, have you been to      
        the Rose Tower?         

282
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,361
     The view of the garden     
     is absolutely divine.      

283
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,763
    Oh, no, no, no, no, no.     

284
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,498
     That's been condemned      
          for forever.          

285
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,434
        Well, don't let         
         that stop you.         

286
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,136
          ( giggles )           

287
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,371
         Hey, if you're         
        around tonight,         

288
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,706
       you should come to       
       the royal dinner.        

289
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,008
                 Oh, that sounds
                 delightful.    

290
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,543
                  But I may have
                  other plans.  

291
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,378
Aw. You got                     
a hot date?                     

292
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,414
            Something like that.

293
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,417
            - Star!             
            - Mom!              

294
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,955
          Omnitraxis!           

295
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,657
             Star, are you okay?
             Did she hurt you?  

296
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,492
What? No.                       
No one hurt me.                 

297
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,061
I was just talking              
to that nice lady.              

298
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,397
           Nice lady?           
           Star, that's Eclypsa.

299
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,166
                 Long time,     
                 no speak, Moon.

300
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,368
              How did that spell
              work for you?     

301
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,971
     Not another word           
   out of you, Eclypsa.         

302
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,473
        That's Eclypsa?         

303
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,042
We need to                      
decontaminate you.              

304
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,545
       - Look into              
       the light, please.       
       - What?                  

305
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,848
       - Uh, to check for       
       spots of evil.           
       - Spots of evil?         

306
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,884
Well, there's no telling        
what Eclypsa might have         
done to you.                    

307
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,586
      Stop it. I am telling you,
      Eclypsa didn't do         
      anything to me.           

308
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,055
                  I am fine.    

309
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,592
      What are you... hey!      

310
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,361
      Cover your left eye       
        with the paddle,        

311
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,595
       and read the lines       
        as best you can.        

312
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,032
             I-A-M-E-V-I...     

313
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,934
         No, you don't.         

314
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,435
        That just spells        
          "I am evil."          

315
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,738
           That was, like,      
           totally an admission.

316
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,406
What? No, this is rigged.       

317
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,574
I was reading the thing.        

318
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,408
          Skin check.           
           Oh, dear.            

319
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,043
   You always had this mole?    

320
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,779
      Yes, but it doesn't       
         make me evil.          

321
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,247
         Just a little          
   self-conscious sometimes.    

322
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,182
     And why is there           
        a monkey?               

323
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,884
   - To check for evil fleas.   
         - Evil fleas?          

324
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,419
        - ( screeching )        
     - He found something.      

325
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,424
  - Never mind. He says         
  they're just regular fleas.   
  - I knew that.                

326
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,559
             Stand here,        
              arms down.        

327
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,795
         - One moment.          
             - Hey!             

328
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,630
              Do you even know  
              what you're doing?

329
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,632
        No, but we still        
        gotta do a test.        

330
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,634
         Are you evil?          

331
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,736
                     No!        

332
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,072
        Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.         

333
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,741
           Are you evil, are you
           evil, are you evil?  

334
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,710
      - Is she all right?       
          - I am fine.          

335
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,946
        I talked to Eclypsa for,
        like, two seconds,      

336
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,281
                    and she was 
                    really nice.
                    No big deal.

337
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,150
It could be                     
a very big deal.                

338
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,952
      Okay, fine, but why?      

339
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,087
       Star, she betrayed       
          her kingdom.          

340
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,123
    She abandoned her people    
      so she could run off      
        with a monster.         

341
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,259
      Mm-hmm, yes, right.       
          I knew that.          

342
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,328
         Kinda selfish.         
         Okay, then what?       
         She blew everything up?

343
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,664
   No. They crystallized her    
   before she had the chance.   

344
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,301
   Wait, you crystallized her   
       for being in love?       

345
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,270
To a monster.                   

346
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,671
And that's not all.             

347
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,940
              She didn't respect
              the natural order.

348
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,910
 She meddled in the dark arts,  
  and created her own chapter   

349
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,645
    of dangerous evil magic.    

350
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,146
  Have you ever even read it?   

351
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,582
         Of course not.         

352
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,751
  Well, I have, and it really   
   wasn't that big of a deal.   

353
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,455
              Ugh. Chime in     
              any time, guys.   
              You knew her, too.

354
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,657
     Uh, I mean, I saw her      
  double-dipping in the ranch   

355
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,925
    at the royal ball once.     

356
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,527
    She told me she thought     
    Rhombulus was annoying.     

357
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,997
     - Can you believe it?      
             - Yes.             

358
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,933
     Oh, yeah? She totally      
      used to eat babies.       

359
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,302
          Nope, nope,           
      that wasn't Eclypsa.      

360
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,537
       That was Bobipsa,        
   the barbarian baby eater.    

361
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,006
                 Are you calling
                 me a liar?     

362
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,108
    I'm pretty sure Eclypsa     
       was a pescaterian.       

363
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,110
          Okay, guys,           
         as fascinating         

364
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,612
        and fact-filled         
    as this conversation is,    

365
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,148
    I'm feeling kinda done.     

366
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,783
    The tests say I'm fine.     

367
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,519
   Star, please, these tests    
     are for your own good.     

368
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,322
        Ugh! I am good.         

369
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,658
 It sounds like Eclypsa didn't  
  deserve to be crystallized.   

370
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,727
      I mean, what's next,      
    you gonna crystallize me    

371
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,696
       if I do something        
     you don't approve of?      

372
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,665
       Give us the room.        

373
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,172
When I first                    
met Eclypsa,                    

374
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,540
I trusted her, too.             

375
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,542
I didn't know                   
any better.                     

376
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,911
Truthfully, Star,               
you're very capable             
for your age, but--             

377
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,813
            Then why won't      
            anyone listen to me?

378
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,715
It's complicated.               

379
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,650
Eclypsa can                     
be very...                      

380
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,552
convincing.                     

381
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,688
For your safety,                
let me handle this.             

382
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,657
   So what are you gonna do?    

383
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,194
I'm afraid the only             
option is immediate             
re-crystallization.             

384
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,762
       What? No. No, no, no, no.

385
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,564
                That's so harsh.

386
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,233
  - You can't just go--         
  - This isn't a debate, Star.  

387
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,769
      I gave my orders to       
   the Magic High Commission,   

388
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,604
    and they're on their way    
    to her cell as we speak.    

389
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,374
  She's to be re-crystallized   
          immediately.          

390
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,177
   Oh, we'll see about that.    

391
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,446
         Oh, Globgore!          

392
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,747
            My wand!            

393
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,649
   Locked! Glossaryck.          

394
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,686
         - Glossaryck!          
          - Globgore?           

395
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,255
     Glossaryck, the wand.      

396
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,757
           Globgore?            

397
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,762
             Wand.              

398
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,398
           Globgore!            

399
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,668
       Oh, yes, yes, yes,       
           yes, yes!            

400
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,138
                Globgore.       

401
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,407
        No, Glossaryck.         
    We have to save Eclypsa.    

402
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,677
           Globgore.            

403
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,549
            Gotcha.             

404
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,584
     Super sparkle cloudy.      

405
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,757
            Wheeeee!            

406
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,662
     I'm gonna enjoy this.      

407
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,498
            Rhombulus, no, wait!

408
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,502
          Turn it off!          

409
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,108
Great. Now I got crystals       
growing outta my...             

410
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,011
            Oh, Star, you caused
            quite the ruckus.   

411
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,280
       Will you all just        
  listen to me for one second?  

412
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,316
      Crystallizing people      
    is a serious punishment,    

413
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,852
       and so far, no one       
  has been able to convince me  

414
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,487
   that Eclypsa deserves it.    

415
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,422
      Star, I know Eclypsa      
          seems nice,           

416
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,625
 but she can get into your head 
     and make you do things     

417
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,627
     you don't want to do.      

418
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,495
        Oh, my goodness,        
         you're right.          

419
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,863
     Giving you that spell      
       to destroy Toffee        

420
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,665
         was her idea.          

421
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,667
         Oh, no, wait.          
        You were the one        

422
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,302
        who went to her         
           for help.            

423
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,637
                     Yes, but...

424
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,871
And you made                    
a deal with her.                

425
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,008
    If Toffee was destroyed,    
       she'd be set free.       

426
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,510
           Well, hey,           
         Toffee's gone,         

427
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,512
     and you wanna go back      
         on your word?          

428
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,814
      But Star, look what       
      her spell did to me.      

429
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,317
        When I performed        
          that spell,           

430
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,818
   I could feel the darkness.   

431
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,854
                     Eclypsa is 
                     evil, Star.

432
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,689
        I know you don't        
        believe it now,         

433
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,391
        but if you wait         
     to find out the truth      

434
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,959
         for yourself,          
       it'll be too late.       

435
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,828
     Okay, fine. If she is      
   as bad as you say she is,    

436
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,564
   then put her in a crystal.   

437
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,899
   But she at least deserves    
     to have a fair trial.      

438
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,301
  Oh, for goodness sake, fine.  

439
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,569
      We'll have a trial.       

440
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,905
              Yes!              
   Due process, due process.    

441
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,841
   but I'm only allowing this   
   because I want there to be   

442
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,577
    no doubt amongst anyone     
           in Mewni--           

443
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,312
   I'm looking at you, Star--   

444
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,581
      that Eclypsa is evil      
     and deserves her fate.     

445
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,082
         See, Eclypsa?          

446
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,850
   Around here, we believe in   
     a little thing called      

447
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,687
      the justice system.       
   Hey, where are you going?    

448
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:50,988
       It's going to take       
         a little time          

449
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,556
        to get the trial        
          all set up.           

450
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,758
    You can't just leave her    
           chained up           

451
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,194
          in this dark          
      and smelly dungeon.       

452
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,299
     You know, I always did     
   enjoy gazing at the roses.   

453
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,104
           Oh, hello,           
      Princess Butterfly.       

454
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,906
          Stand aside.          

455
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,254
     - Eclypsa.                 
     - Star. I was hoping--     
     - Don't move.              

456
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,755
      I want some answers.      

457
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,891
     Did you or did you not     
     mess with dark magic?      

458
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,362
         Well... I did          
    what I had to do for me.    

459
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,297
  If the Magic High Commission  
        and your mother         

460
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,400
       think that's evil,       
     call me a villainess.      

461
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,870
       Wait. Are you in my mind?

462
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,206
          They said you could be
          in my mind, and I     
          wouldn't even know.   

463
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,275
Definitely not.                 

464
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,943
But if I were,                  
I wouldn't tell you.            

465
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,945
That's a joke.                  

466
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,913
                   Oh, it wasn't
                   very funny.  

467
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,882
  - But that's okay, 'cause...  
          - Globgore.           

468
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,151
           Globgore!            

469
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,987
        - Glossaryck!           
        Good to see you.        
        - Globgore!             

470
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,923
      He's, uh, he's been       
   kind of a handful lately.    

471
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:04,061
    Could you maybe do that     
 crystal-y tickly thing again?  

472
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,063
            - Sure.             
     - Globgore, globgore.      

473
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,399
I might corrupt him.            

474
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,601
             What?!             

475
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,269
      ( nervous laughter )      

476
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,971
     That was another joke.     
             Right?             

477
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,807
           Globgore?            
           Globgore.            

478
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,977
      Aw, they're so sweet      
     when they're sleeping.     

479
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,146
   Okay, listen, just because   
       I didn't want you        

480
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,415
       crystallized again       
   doesn't mean I trust you.    

481
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,283
     I just want you to be      
        treated fairly.         

482
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,952
      Although, this place      
      doesn't exactly seem fair.

483
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,821
  What in the rodent is that?!  

484
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,857
Well, I love it here.           

485
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,793
Actually, this was              
my room, you know,              

486
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,262
       back in the, well,       
       you know, before.        

487
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,963
       A lot has changed.       

488
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,066
     But the most important     
    thing's still the same.     

489
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,472
              Wow!              

490
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,276

is incredible.
