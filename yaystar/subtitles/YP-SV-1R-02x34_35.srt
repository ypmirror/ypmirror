00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,818

        the source of the fritz.

55
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,328
       Evidence? I've got       
       your evidence right here.

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,131

62
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,844
              I know it came    
              from a good place,
              you know, but...  

63
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,079
       Okay, Chancellor,        
       for the record,          

64
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,948
        we had nothing          
        to do with this.

( grunts, pants )               

66
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,418
Yeah, we told him               
it was a horrible plan,         

67
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,720
but Rockhead                    
here didn't wanna hear it.      

68
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,222
         He never listens to us!

69
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,724
      But he would listen       
      to you, Lekmet!           

70
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,059
Tell him, Chancellor!           
                       Tell him!

72
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,730
        Okay, everybody,        
        just calm down!         

73
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,232
Why don't you sit?              

74
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,134
I'll grab you                   
a glass of warm milk,           

75
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,870
and then we can talk this out   
like rational people.

                Shoot! I forgot 
                I put him there.

78
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,713
         Okay, so I actually    
         don't know who this is.

79
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,816
              A servant maybe?  
              A very tall dwarf?

80
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,351
                But he's        
                definitely evil.

      the High Chancellor!

Do you have any idea            
how much trouble we are in?!    

98
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,524
      Stop yelling at me!

    Look, I just really need    
        a win right now.        

100

       to be on my side!

I bet a few reps                
would clear your head.          

105
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,209
          Huh. You know,        
          that's not a bad idea.

Bench presses,

           ( gasps )            

120
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,376
              You! I know       
              you're the source!

121
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,345
                  I can feel it!

122
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,181
Huh?                            

123
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,883
               Why did you      
               cause the fritz?!

124
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,518
Aaaaah!                         

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,053
                No! No no no no!

126
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,521
( screaming stops )             

127
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:27,259
        I really just can't take
        any more yelling today. 

128
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,430
Aah!                            
           Princess!            
           My name is Rhombulus.

129
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,265
         I work with your mom,  
         and I need you         
         to answer one question.

130
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,866
Rhombulus?                      

131
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,903
Ohh, ohh!                       

132
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,971
You're the time-out guy.        

133
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,840
        What? Who calls me that?

134
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,608
          I bet it's Glossaryck,
          isn't it?             

135
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,910
Omnitraxus                      
calls you that, too.            

136
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,878
And my mom and dad.             

137
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,281
Really all of the members       
of the Magic High Commission    
call you that.                  

138
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,449
Time-out guy.                   

139
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:51,883
                Ohh, never mind!

140
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,052
             Why are you causing
             the fritz?         

141
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,954
What's the fritz?               

142
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,157
        The leak.               
        The reason why nothing's
        working up here?        

143
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,959
( mumbles )                     
I don't know.                   

144
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,095
Oh! Something has been draining 
       the power of magic       

145
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,497
       from the universe.       

146
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,400
               See? Crystal orbs
               are down.        

147
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,435
      And then there's          
      the Green Hole over there.

148
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:11,870
          ( droning )           

149
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,072
        Yeah, that part         
    definitely looks broken.    

150
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,441
         And look at the crystal
         I trapped Lekmet in.   

151
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,343
         This stuff used        
         to be hard as diamonds.

152
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,513
        Now it's like...        
        rock candy or something.

153
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:25,016
I'm sorry your powers are       
all crazy, but it's not me.     

154
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,251
      You have to be the source!

155
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,086
         You see all these guys?

156
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,957
          My gut told me        
          they were evil,       
          so I crystalized them.

157
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,594
There's Zedlord, who blew up    
an entire planet.               

158
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,929
Astrobell and                   
the black hole she created.     

159
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,365
Stopped                         
that one just in time.          

160
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,034
            Oh, and then there's
            pizza delivery guy. 

161
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,670
           Delivered the pizza  
           to the wrong address.

162
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,039
        Then, of course,        
       I am most proud of       

163
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,510
       the evil twins...        
       John and Jack.           

164
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,944
      They're pretty hard       
         to tell apart,         

165
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,280
        but one of them         
      was definitely evil.      

166
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,982
              This is what I do.

167
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,183
             I find             
             the source of evil,

168
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,085
             and I encase it    
             in crystal forever.

169
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,989
So... your snake hands,         
they're evil, too?              

170
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:07,092
               What? No.        
               They're my hands.

171
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,460
What                            
about my friend, Marco?         

172
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,295
What did he do, exactly?        

173
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,630
                Oh, him? Well...

174
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,931
And what about                  
that old goat man?              

175
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,232
Is he evil?                     

176
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,935
      ( scoffs ) There's        
      nothing evil about Lekmet.

177
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,270
     He's the most pure-hearted,

178
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,006
         hard-working angel goat
         demon there ever was.  

179
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,008
Well, why did you               
crystallize him then?           

180
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,209
Hmm?                            

181
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,512
Look, time-out guy,             

182
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,948
I think you need to think       
stuff through a little more     

183
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,583
before you rely on your gut.    

184
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,019
It's making you crystallize     
innocent people.                

185
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,455
      Maybe you're right.       

186
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,690
           I thought            
    I could trust you, gut!     

187
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,059
          ( grunting )          

188
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,495
      ( shouting angrily )      

189
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,497
    ( crystals shattering )     

190
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,502
           I'm free!            

191
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,004
          ( panting )           

192
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,973
         ( grumbling )          

193
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,009
I've been wrong                 
about everything lately.        

194
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,145
The commission                  
thinks I'm a joke.              

195
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,981
I thought if I could find       
the source of the fritz,        

196
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,484
my hands and I                  
could earn the appreciation     

197
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,252
of the Magical                  
High Commission again.          

198
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,320
              Huh?              

199
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,323
            Aw, man.            

200
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,158
I actually                      
crystallized Lekmet.            

201
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,293
And I love Lekmet!              

202
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,196
( sobbing )                     

203
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,032
                    Ooh, pretty!

204
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:24,569
I'm gonna be in time-out        
for the next ten thousand years.

205
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,138
Glossaryck is gonna             
have a field day with that.     

206
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,473
Let me tell you.                

207
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,342
                Ah, I wouldn't  
                worry 'bout him.

208
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,077
           He's not coming back.

209
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,145
What? Glossaryck's gone?        

210
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,414
                Oh! ( chuckles )

211
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,483
                     Uh, yeah...

212
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:42,354
Glossaryck's gone?              
This is amazing!                

213
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,422
I mean,                         
it's actually really bad.       

214
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,024
( chuckling )                   
But it's good for me.           

215
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,360
But, yeah, wow.                 
That's bad news                 
for the universe.               

216
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,061
                            Why?

217
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,631
The thing about Glossaryck      
is he may be a jerk,            

218
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:57,135
but he's the most powerful      
all-knowing magic jerk          
in the universe.                

219
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,371
That's why I can never win      
an argument with him.           

220
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,207
            He's just so hard   
            to deal with, right?

221
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,209
          Even when             
          I tried to rescue him,

222
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,144
              he didn't         
              want to come back.

223
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,280
You know that fancy crystal     
in his head?                    

224
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,814
I gave it to him!               

225
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,083
But did he                      
ever thank me? No.              

226
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,220
       Every time we got donuts,
       he just sat on them.     

227
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,389
         ( sighs )              
         What a waste of donuts.

228
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:21,092
You know, I made some donuts    
for a meeting yesterday,        

229
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,128
and I think                     
there's some left over.         

230
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,796
Uh... you want any?             

231
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,769
                            Ooh.

232
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,306
       You know, you shouldn't  
       feel so down on yourself,
       Rhombulus.               

233
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,142
              Your crystals     
              are really pretty.

234
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,143
           ( clinks )           

235
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,144
                             Ah!

236
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,313
Close your eyes for a minute.   

237
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,081
                           Okay.

238
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,250
Now open!                       
                             Oh.

239
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,252
Here.                           

240
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,653
                            Ooh!

241
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,722
                 Is that        
                 evil twin Jack?

242
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,123
It could be.                    

243
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,858
Either way,                     
I want you to have it.          

244
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,260
           Thank you, Rhombulus.

245
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,263
So, I guess you've got          
to turn me in, right?           

246
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,633
I mean, crystallizing           
the princess is                 
kind of a big deal.             

247
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,769
            Uh, not necessarily.

248
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,639
            Okay, look, if you  
            don't tell the Magic
            High Commission     

249
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,608
               about Glossaryck 
               or the Magic Book
               of Spells        

250
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,477
                  and how I lost
                  both of them, 

251
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,379
               then I won't tell
               them about this. 

252
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,614
                 ( clink clink )
Really?                         

253
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,248
                           Yeah.
Deal.                           

254
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,417
               What about       
               the old goat man?

255
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,286
Well, don't                     
worry about him.                

256
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,122
I'm the only one who can        
understand what he says.        

257
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,391
      Also I need my socks back.

258
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,794
         ( straining )          

259
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,229
           ( grunts )           

260
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,263
           Ooh, phew.           

261
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:35,300
Hey.                            
Thank you, Princess.            

262
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,568
          W-w-w-wait!           

263
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,136
           You still            
      gotta unfreeze him.       

264
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,137
Oh, yeah.                       

265
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,808
                             Ow!

266
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,377
Good morning, Marco!            

267
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,611
            Star? What happened?

268
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,446
               You were         
               in this ice cube.

269
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,914
          And there was         
          this big guy, and he  
          had a big square head!

270
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,884
( laughs ) What                 
a funny dream, Marco.           

271
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,819
                            Mmm!

272
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,154
                          Blech!

273
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,188
                   Were these   
                   on the floor?

274
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,362
       ( rats squeaking )       

275
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,271
       Hyah! Mush! Mush!        

276
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,674
             Hyah!              

277
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,743
       LUDO: Hello! Yes!        

278
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,222
        I have arrived.         

279
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,792
Did you keep him up             
all night?                      

280
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,695
You haven't fed him, have you?  

281
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,299
Good! Then                      
he must be about to crack.      

282
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,235
Time to turn up the heat.       

283
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,203
        ( low humming )         

284
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,604
What's that?                    

285
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:50,308
Hold on a minute.               
I have to take this.            

286
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,343
What? Yes.                      
Oh, of course.                  

287
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,280
That'll be our last resort,     
heh heh.                        

288
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,384
        ( door creaks )         

289
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,219
Well, well, well!               

290
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,354
           How do you           
    like my monster temple?     

291
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,756
       Pretty cool, huh?        

292
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,324
       My wand told me          
       where to find it.        

293
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,692
( loud bang )                   
                            Aah!

294
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,228
Hellooo...                      

295
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,362
             ( mumbles )        
             What are you doing?

296
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,399
         I was just out         
     for my morning stroll.     

297
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,000
             But then           
             who is in your bed?

298
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,769
               Oh! Oh! Oh! Um...

299
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,370
              Easy. ( chuckles )

300
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,239
              Easy. Don't shoot.

301
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,542
              It's, uh...       
              It's just my robe.

302
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,278
   Girls! Bring me the book!    

303
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,249
I want you to teach me this,    

304
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,753
to make me awesome...           
at this!                        

305
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,287
You will not resist!            

306
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,757
Resistance is pointless!        

307
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,359
                    Uh, you mind
                    hopping off?

308
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,761
Thank you.                      

309
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:46,431
Okay.                           
Let's get started.              

310
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,267
            But... you're       
            not going to resist,

311
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,869
       even a little resistance?

312
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,904
Look, it's your book now.       

313
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,740
I'm just here                   
to help you... or not.          

314
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,308
Up to you.                      

315
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,410
           Really?              
           You<i> want</i> to teach me?

316
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,712
Oh, yes. Sure.                  

317
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:04,382
        What's your game?       
        You must want something.

318
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,317
Oh, I don't have wants.         

319
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,619
I have a job.                   

320
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,853
And that job is to help you     

321
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,023
reach your ultimate             
potential with this.            

322
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,725
                   Well, then...

323
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,059
           Pudding!             

324
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,328
Someone just earned             
themselves some pudding.        

325
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,997
You, little man,                
you are going to make me        

326
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,799
the most powerful being         
in the universe! Ha ha ha!      

327
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,333
         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

328
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,435
                Now, slow, slow,
                slow your roll. 

329
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:28,473
         Look, all I can promise
         is to help you reach   
         your full potential.   

330
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,009
Oh, goody!                      
Is it going to be hard?         

331
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,610
                   Mm, could be.

332
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,745
Exhausting?                     

333
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,313
            Mmm, quite possibly.

334
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,349
Almost unendurable?             

335
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,451
           Uh... Well,          
           do you want it to be?

336
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:44,088
Oh, yes!                        
I so want it to be.             

337
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,624
         ( straining )          

338
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,427
        Stroke! Stroke!         

339
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,796
          ( grunting )          

340
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:55,700
           ( grunting, panting )

341
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:05,577
             This... is so hard!

342
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,379
            When are we going to
            start doing spells? 

343
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,814
Whenever you want.              

344
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,383
            What?!              
            Are you kidding me?!

345
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:12,383
          What was all of this?!

346
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,587
Oh, this?                       
Well, I was only doing that     

347
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,656
because you said you wanted it  
to be really hard.              

348
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,124
   I don't know what I want!    

349
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:23,828
  I've never done this before!  

350
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,866
     You know what my dad       
     taught me about making     
     my way in the world?       

351
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,500
            Nothing!            

352
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,636
       Zip! I was one egg       
         out of fifty!          

353
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:36,507
    Everything I've learned,    
    I had to learn dirty!       

354
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,745
    But for once in my life,    
    I'd like some guidance.     

355
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,415
Okay. We can do that.           

356
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,884
            Really?             

357
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,822
So when am I going              
to learn a Narwhal Blast?       

358
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,523
Pshew pshew pshew!              

359
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,892
               Oh, oh. Oh, that.

360
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,561
            Yes, well, mm-hmm...

361
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,029
              You see,          
              Star made that up.

362
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,530
           It's not in the book.

363
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,533
                She just used   
                her imagination 
                for most things.

364
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,904
Ooh!                            
What's an imagination?          

365
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,506
                 ( sighs ) Okay.

366
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,874
               Well, let's start

367
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,476
                with the basics.
           ( snaps )            

368
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,780
              ( mumbling )      
              Let's see... okay.

369
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,449
          Oh, that's probably   
          a little too advanced.

370
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,151
                   Okay, okay...
                   ( mumbling ) 

371
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,753
                 Oh! Here we go.

372
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,822
Uh, why don't you               
take a look here?               

373
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,791
Now note                        
the stance and posture.         

374
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:31,029
Basically, you're               
going to want to put your arm   
out and your feet...            

375
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,563
Ahem... less out.               

376
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,933
You got that?                   
                           Okay.

377
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,634
                        Rrrrrrr!

378
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,636
Hmm...                          

379
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,471
         ( straining )          

380
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,439
                          Hmm...

381
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,475
         ( straining )          

382
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,810
           Would you just relax?

383
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,478
              Oh.               

384
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,481
We're going to start            
with some simple                
object transfer.                

385
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,919
Let's have you try              
Levitato.                       

386
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,654
                       Levitato.

387
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,223
Now, when you're ready,         
I want you to bring me          
that apple.                     

388
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,692
                     What apple?
That one.                       

389
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,230
           Levitato.            

390
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,467
         Levitato! Aah!         

391
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,603
O-kay.                          

392
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,205
              Oh! You see that?!

393
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,607
             How am I supposed  
             to work with this?!

394
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,210
     I listen to my wand,       
     but it never listens to me.

395
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,112
Look, kid,                      
it's your first try.            

396
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,647
Don't worry about it.           
           ( snaps )            

397
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,583
We'll just try again.           
Relax.                          

398
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,786
          ( inhales )           

399
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,588
           Levitato!            

400
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,994
                     Levit--    
Okay, okay.                     

401
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,196
No, no. No, no, stop.           

402
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,498
Look,                           
you're really being sloppy.     

403
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,266
You need                        
to really feel it.              

404
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,669
Say it with conviction.         

405
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,572
Levitato!                       

406
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,709
          Lev-i-tato.           

407
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,116
           It worked.           

408
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,985
           ( gasps )            

409
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,620
           Levitato.            

410
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,059
Hey!                            
Now you're getting it.          

411
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,093
Nice job.                       

412
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,862
          Am I better than Star?

413
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,630
Well, I...                      

414
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,033
Well, I guess you're better     
at following the spell book.    

415
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,535
         Are you... proud of me?

416
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,604
Yeah, um...                     
Yeah, you're doing fine.        

417
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,173
          Could you say         
          "proud of me," though?

418
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,608
Uh, huh.                        

419
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,210
Uh... ( chuckles )              
I'm proud of you.               

420
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,678
                    ( giggling )

421
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,888
Hmm.                            
                ( wand zapping )

422
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,290
             Levitato. Levitato.

423
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,726
           Levitato.            

424
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,567
          ( whirring )          

425
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,935
           Levitato.            

426
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,807
              Yep.              

427
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,746
           GLOSSARYCK:          
           Um, you see,         
           it's a complex theory

428
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,847
       behind the levitations...
Levitato.                       

429
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,849
         you'll be performing...
Levitato!                       

430
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,350
                as a magic user.

431
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,619
             And they all lived 
             happily ever after.

432
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,921
                        The end.
Levitato.                       

433
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,322
                 You'd better   
                 get some sleep.

434
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,790
          You have a lot of work
          to do tomorrow.       

435
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,258
Levitato.                       

436
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,327
                Might even learn
                a second spell  
                or something.   

437
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,696
This was a really great day,    
Glossaryck.                     

438
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,931
                I'm sure it was.

439
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,265
Will you tuck me in?            

440
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,734
                  Um, well, I...
                  Uh, okay.     

441
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,338
And my wand.                    

442
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,707
                           Uh...

443
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,708
      ( excited chuckle )       

444
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,776
Ahem... there you go.           

445
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,278
                And pat my head?

446
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,847
Pat pat pat,                    
see you in the morning.         

447
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,616
     And say, "Good night,      
          my darling."          

448
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,151
             Are you kidding me?

449
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,619
                 Um, good night.

450
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,954
My darling.                     

451
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,723
      Um, uh...                 
      ( stammering ) my darling.

452
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,132
          ( snoring )

00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,637
            ( whispering )      
            Are you still awake?

454
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,639
          I can't sleep, either!

455
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,307
                 I'm too excited
                 to sleep!      

456
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,076
            Today was wonderful!

457
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,744
( wand humming )                

458
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,380
         Why would you say that?

459
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,716
      Glossaryck is proud of me.

460
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,084
         He said                
         I was better than Star!

461
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,886
( humming )                     

462
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,787
               What do you mean,
               he showed her    
               something hidden?

463
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,322
                 Don't be silly!

464
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,958
                We just started.
                I'm sure we'll  
                get to it soon. 

465
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,360
( humming )                     

466
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,395
             He kept it         
             from me on purpose?

467
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,763
( humming )                     

468
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,231
             No. No, no, no, no.

469
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,367
           He'd never lie to me!

470
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,106
           Levitato!            

471
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,809
Glossaryck? Wake up!            

472
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,679
      Didn't we just do bedtime?

473
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,715
Glossaryck.                     
I know this is crazy,           

474
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,751
but my wand told me...          

475
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:49,253
( chuckling ) It's just         
my wand told me                 

476
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,821
there's a chapter in this book  
that you've shown Star          

477
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,256
that you haven't shown me.      

478
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,392
But that's crazy, right?        

479
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,160
                  No, it's true.

480
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,729
What?!                          
Why didn't you show me?!        

481
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,997
                 You know,      
                 you didn't ask.

482
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,832
Well, I want to see it!         

483
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,367
             ( sighs )          
             You want to see it.

484
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,037
               You want to see--
               Well, you know,  
               I don't know.    

485
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,406
           It's really advanced.

486
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,841
                   Um, you know,
                   dark stuff.  

487
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,710
Did you show it to Star?        

488
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,080
              Um, technically,  
              I didn't show her,

489
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,349
       but, uh, she has seen it.

490
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,984
Show me!                        

491
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,153
           Okay, it's your book.

492
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,991
                 Secret chapter.

493
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,392
                      Unlock it!

494
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,762
      Are you truly sure?       
      It could taint you.       

495
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,765
Oh, I got plenty                
of taint already.               

496
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,067
Now unlock it!                  

497
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,735
          ( sighs ) As you wish.

498
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,917
              Hmm!              

499
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,218
           I thought            
     there'd be more pict--     

500
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,254
              Aah!              

501
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,756
             Ohhh!              

502
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,431
       ( Toffee's voice )       
       Hello, Glossaryck.       

503
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,767
                  Hello, Toffee.

504
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,769
Time to give it up,             
old man.                        

505
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,438
You'll never get him            
on your side.                   

506
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
        But I don't have a side.

507
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,809
You don't, do you?              

508
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,445
( chuckles )                    

509
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,913
Excellent.
