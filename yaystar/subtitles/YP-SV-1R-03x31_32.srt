00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,823
          [drowsy] Hey... what--

122
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,191
              What are you doing

123
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,527
                  on the ground?

124
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,796
                 What am I doing
                 on the ground? 

125
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,702
     Oh, gee! Oh! [panting]     

126
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:04,869
       My face is itchy.        

127
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,938
     Why is my face itchy?!     

128
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,940
Because you're                  
in a burlap sack.               

129
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,775
             Aah! Don't sneak up
             on me!             

130
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,444
Ow! Sorry.                      

131
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,679
        -What happened?         
        -I don't know.          

132
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,680
                   Where are we?

133
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,948
I don't know.                   

134
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,650
                  Who did this?!

135
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,852
Star, I know                    
exactly the same amount         
as you do right now,            

136
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,887
which is nothing.               

137
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,223
        Somebody really         
        does not want us to know
        where Buff Frog is.     

138
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,891
             Okay, let's get up,
             ready?             

139
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,527
        On the count of three...
        one, two...             

140
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,529
                      [groaning]

141
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,699
[grunts, screaming]             

142
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,068
        Tom! Tom! Are you okay?!

143
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,037
I think I just found out        
I'm claustrophobic,             

144
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,705
and I might be panicking        
a little!                       

145
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,873
                        Me, too!

146
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,208
              I think I'm close.

147
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,876
        Just stay where you are.
        I'll come to you.       

148
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,344
      -No, Tom, stay put!       
         -[whimpering]          

149
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,879
     -Tom! It's all right!      
          -[screaming]          

150
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,514
        I'm right here!         
        I'm right here!         

151
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,716
          -Aahh! Aah!           
          -[thunk]              

152
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,084
             [Star] Tom, stop   
             being so difficult!

153
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,019
Huh? [straining]                

154
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,890
Uh, I accidentally gored a tree,
and, well, now I'm stuck.       

155
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,093
        A tree! Aha! Now we know
        we're in the woods!     

156
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,828
                         [roars]

157
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,297
          [Star] Run!           

158
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,100
Woo-hoo! Okay, I don't know     
what I just did,                

159
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,402
but I think                     
it was pretty awesome,          

160
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,036
and I am very proud             
of myself for it!               

161
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,905
                         Oh, no!

162
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,708
I have message for you.         

163
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,178
Those that search               
for little lost frogs           

164
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,382
will find themselves            
at bottom of swamp!             

165
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,583
            What does that mean?

166
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,719
Stop looking for Buff Frog!     

167
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,755
And to make sure                
message is clear,               

168
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,125
       -break his horns!        
             -Aah!              

169
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,293
         [Tom screams]          

170
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,962
What is going on here?!         

171
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,565
                Buff Frog?!     
                Oh! You're okay!

172
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,599
Hello, Princess.                

173
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,734
       -[happy croaking]        
       -Oh!                     

174
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,936
                  [whisper yell]
                  Babiiiess!    

175
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,706
               I was so worried!
               That letter      
               freaked me out.  

176
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,975
       Letter? I know           
       nothing of letter.       

177
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,713
Excuse me. The person           
who wrote the letter was me.    

178
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,983
      Aw, Katrina got li'l arms!

179
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,554
    Oy yi yi. How many times    
     must I tell children,      

180
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,157
   to become spy, they must     
   not to leave paper trail?    

181
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,992
    Is like number one rule.    

182
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,761
        Kids these days.        

183
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,996
               But your house...
               it was a mess.   

184
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,833
   When you are single parent   
        of pile of kids,        

185
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,968
  I would like see your house!  

186
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,137
I just want Star                
to know we were leaving.        

187
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:23,074
   Leaving? Where are you going?
   Grocery shopping?            

188
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,177
       No. We must leave        
    this dimension for good.    

189
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,346
       We cannot stay           
       on Mewni anymore.        

190
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,849
                  What are you--
                  What are you  
                  talking about?

191
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,051
      [sad music playing]       

192
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,589
                 What? No, but--
                 No, no, no!    

193
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,457
            No! You can't leave!

194
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,126
           I need your help     
           to bring Monsters    
           and Mewmans together!

195
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,661
                 We're so close!

196
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:47,098
         Sorry, Star, you tried,
         but it not work.       

197
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,868
This not problem                
you can solve.                  

198
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,539
                    [Tom] Fools!

199
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,774
        Beg your pardon?        

200
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,645
 You heard me. You're all being 
  a bunch of fools right now.   

201
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,347
     How can you say things     
       will never change?       

202
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,516
      Things are changing.      

203
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,319
  I mean, Buff Frog, you work   
  at the castle now, right?     

204
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,121
         Star did that.         

205
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,626
    True, yes, but everyone     
 in castle still scared of me.  

206
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,194
   Plus commute is terrible.    

207
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,162
What do you care,               
Your Highness?                  

208
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,231
   What? Why wouldn't I care?   

209
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,633
   -'Cause you don't know...    
   -...what it's like!          

210
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,903
Being treated differently,      
day in and day out.             

211
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,237
           I do know what       
           it's like, because...

212
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,240
           I, too, am a Monster.

213
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,309
               Yeah! Wait, what?

214
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,644
    -What? Are you serious?     
        -I had no idea.         

215
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,745
             What?!             

216
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,148
Well, technically half Monster. 

217
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,083
    I got these eyes, horns,    

218
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,084
             -tail.             
             -[rip]             

219
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,352
               Okay, that's new.

220
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,489
      And lets not forget       
           this face!           

221
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,424
       -Look at it!             
       -[Monsters scream]       

222
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,893
        Please, please.         
   Not in front of children.    

223
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,429
Yeah, but I mean,               
you're a rich guy.              

224
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,232
I mean, ri-- right?             
He's... he's rich.              

225
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,200
Doesn't count.                  

226
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,736
      Okay, you're right.       

227
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,839
        I am very rich.         

228
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,044
       Uh, but when I get       
on an elevator with a stranger, 

229
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,613
         I'm a Monster          
     just like all of you.      

230
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,182
   I'm a rich Monster, yeah,    

231
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,617
       but I'm a Monster.       

232
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,020
Thank you for pretty words,     
purple boy.                     

233
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,124
But for us to stay,             
we need more than words.        

234
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,761
        Star Butterfly,         
      you are good person.      

235
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:27,231
      You tried your best,      
  but it was not good enough.   

236
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,700
           I'm sorry.           

237
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,468
                 No, no, no, no,
                 Buff Frog,     
                 please wait!   

238
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,137
               I can try harder!
               We have to       
               stick together!  

239
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,939
         Goodbye, Star.         

240
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:39,944
Perhaps when it is your time    
to rule, we will come back.     

241
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,246
          My time?              
          But how will you know?

242
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:46,217
Princess, please,               
it's me, Buff Frog, master spy. 

243
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,753
Trust me, I will know.          

244
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,455
Babushkas, come say bye.

             You sweet          
             little baby angels.

247
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,594
         I'm-a miss you so much!

248
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,998
Okay, no more                   
with the sentimental.           

249
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,166
Time to go, everyone!           

250
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,502
           After you.           

251
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,770
                  No, after you.

252
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,972
       No, no, after you.       

253
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,008
           Together!            

254
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,179
     Okay, now you babies.      

255
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,782

       Where is Katrina?        

258
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,758
         I made you something   
         so you don't forget me.

259
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,494
Aw, Katrina!                    

260
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,863
I actually got something        
for you, too.                   

261
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:32,964
                         My toy!

264
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,619
           Oh, Tom, I-- I can't 
           believe they're gone.

265
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,654
         I feel like I've       
         only made things worse.

266
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,189
Have a little faith, Star.      

267
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,558
I'm a Monster,                  
you're a Mewman.                

268
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,995
If we can make it work,         
then there's hope for everyone. 

269
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,997
                Aw, thanks, Tom.

270
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,399
You're welcome.                 

271
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,203
              So did I do better
              than Marco?       

272
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,743
All right, we'll just pop in    
and pop out real quick,         

273
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,212
'cause I've got that Royal      
Squire mixer this afternoon.    

274
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,381
      Aah! I caught the bouquet!
      I caught the bouquet!     

275
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,849
                    I caught    
                    the bouquet!

276
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,418
               So... what kind  
               of party is this?

277
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,188
Bird... Bird Day?               

278
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,390
Bird Day? Is that a thing?      
Bird Day?                       

279
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,858
Doesn't it say                  
on the invite?                  

280
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,426
          Star!                 
          I'm a squire of Mewni.

281
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,061
               I don't have time
               to read invites! 

282
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,163
Seems to be some kind           
of kid-washing party.           

283
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,399
             -What?             
    -Yeah, a "baby shower."     

284
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,401
             Eh, guess someone's
             having a baby.     

285
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,603
A dirty baby                    
it sounds like,                 

286
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,371
seeing as to how                
they're gonna wash it.          

287
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,040
                          Marco!

288
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,043
           Hey, Mom!            
   So, who's having the baby?   

289
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,345
                 Can't you tell?

290
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,249
         [gasps] Mom?!          
   You're gonna be... a mom?!   

291
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,350
     When did this happen?!     

292
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,619
              Oh, while you were
              out on Mewni.     

293
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,888
            And you're going    
            to be a big brother!

294
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:08,259
            Say hello           
            to your hermanito-- 
            Marco Junior!       

295
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,728
Ohmigosh, ohmigosh,             
ohmigosh, ohmigosh!             

296
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,264
               Wait. What?      
               You're naming him
               Marco Junior?    

297
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,699
After you.                      

298
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,300
        That's not how it works!

299
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,935
         You don't name your son
         after your son!        

300
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,240
But he's got a little mole      
just like you, Marco Senior.    

301
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,741
       Wow... a brother!        

302
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,043
     How have I not heard       
     about this until now?      

303
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,278
               It's okay.       
               You've been busy.

304
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,380
              Point is,         
              you're here today.

305
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,716
              Now, give your mom
              a hug!            

306
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,719
Oh, yeah, okay.                 

307
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,489
                I spent 37 hours
                squeezing you   
                out of my body, 

308
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,624
         and this is what I get?

309
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,492
Oh, I just didn't want to--     

310
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,994
         Give your mother a hug.

311
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,462
Okay.                           

312
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,432
            Now come on! We have
            a baby to shower!

      [people chattering]       

314
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,502
          Whoa! I felt him kick!

315
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,937
      We might have to find     
      a spot for this little guy

316
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,906
       on the Mewni Kings guard!

317
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,676
[laughs] No, I think            
stealing one of our sons        
is enough for now, Star.        

318
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,745
     Oh, oh, oh!                
     He's kicking? He's kicking?

319
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,414
        Why, yes, Marco,        
   you may touch my stomach.    

320
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,483
          I don't feel anything.

321
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,185
He must have stopped.           

322
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,320
        You think that's because
        he doesn't like me?     

323
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,356
I think his brain               
is the size of a grape.         

324
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,292
Which reminds me,               
I'm gonna eat a bag of grapes

     Yeah, it was in that       
     invitation you didn't read.

328
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,101
Oh, Gustav, you've              
outdone yourself again!         

329
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,870
Oh, my gosh!                    

330
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,339
I didn't get a gift             
for Marco Jr.

333
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,480
        I know! Why don't we    
        pop on over to Quest Buy

334
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,149
               and get him      
               a little present?

335
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,818
Quest Buy? I don't know.        

336
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,720
        -Sure! Come on!         
        -Whoa!                  

337
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,388
    Well, we were so lonely     
        that we decided,        

338
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,957
  "Hey, why not have a baby?"   

339
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,292
  Marco, where are you going?   

340
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,694
Uh, I'm gonna, uh,              

341
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,963
run out and grab some ice       
for the party.                  

342
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,965
      But we have plenty of ice.

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,700
Yeah,                           
but I'm gonna get               

344
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,669
fancy ice they harvest          
from a glacier.                 

345
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,172
       Oooh! Glacier ice.       

346
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,573
             Well, don't be gone
             too long.          

347
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,242
          We'll be              
          opening presents soon.

348
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,410
       -No problem-o.           
       -Get out of here,        
       tap-water ice!           

349
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,412
You are not needed anymore!     

350
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,316
      Are you...                
      just gonna hold your drink
      until Marco gets back?    

351
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,354
For glacier ice?                
I will wait.

    [elevator music playing]    

353
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,258
Seriously?! None of this stuff  
is safe for a baby!

         than not having enemies

356
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,864
            because you poisoned
            them all?!          

357
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,501
I am not giving                 
the baby a pacifier             
filled with magic poison.       

358
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,403
            Well, there's always
            a gift card?        

359
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,439
    [female voice] You have     
  8.5 minutes until expiration. 

360
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,440
                            Aah!

361
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,076
     No! Aaah! Please! No!      

362
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,211
[laser blast]                   

363
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,445
    No.                         

364
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,881
This gift has to be             
the perfect reminder of me      

365
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,284
since I might                   
not be around much.             

366
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,885
                     Oh, I know!

367
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,589
             [Marco] "Atelier   
             de Cobalt Ferrero."

368
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,191
                He works        
                in the basement?

369
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,860
          Mr. Ferrero?          

370
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,028
               [impatient] What?

371
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,629
Oh, your portraitness.          

372
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,864
              Eh? Whaddaya want?

373
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,399
      My friend Marco here      

374
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,600
           wants one            
  of your legendary portraits.  

375
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,735
           Is that right, Marco?

376
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,438
Yeah. I'm starting              
to think this is a bad idea.    

377
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,641
Oh! Rich Pigeon?                
Sorry didn't see you there.     

378
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,377
  -Uh, Marco, that's a portrait.
            -What?!             

379
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,947
          That piece?           
     Not even finished yet.     

380
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,383
       Wow, he's so real,       
    I can almost smell him!     

381
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,485
          That's just           
          the perch he posed on.

382
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,620
That's fowl.                    

383
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,555
Get it?                         
'Cause he's a bird.             

384
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,257
It's the perfect gift!          

385
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,426
A portrait that realistic,      
it's like I'll be there         

386
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,627
with my family                  
even when I'm not!              

387
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,662
              I know, I know.   
              I'm very talented.

388
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,498
         But we got a lotta work
         to do before           
         the painting begins.   

389
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,134
                 I have to study
                 you closely.   

390
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:41,339
        I have to live with you,
        breathe with you,       
        eat a lock of your hair.

391
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,342
        The process takes weeks,
        maybe months.           

392
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,943
Can't you do                    
something faster?               

393
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,312
          No! I never compromise
          my work.              

394
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,748
           -650 Cash.           
           -Sold.               

395
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,850
            You need            
            one of these things.

396
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,118
          A scantron?           

397
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,686
And one of these.               

398
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,922
    What? I don't have time     
        for a pop quiz!         

399
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,657
It's an Essence Test,           
wise guy.                       

400
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,993
The abridged version of me      
studying you for months.        

401
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,695
      "What kind of socks       
  do you prefer with loafers?   

402
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,697
A: tube socks, B: ankle socks." 

403
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,499
      How is this supposed      
    to help with a portrait?    

404
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,701
      Whatever! I don't         
      have time for this!       

405
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,337
           [humming]            

406

        [music playing]         

407
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,346
   Uh, Mr. Ferrero? All done.   

408
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,216
Let's make some art!            

409
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,952
            -[ding]             
            -Let's.             

410
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,488
    [dramatic music playing]    

411
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,725
            C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

412
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,560
         Time's running out     
         and my legs are asleep!

413
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,762
            -Hmm.               
            -[snaps]            

414
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,334
             Mwah!              

415
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,302
          She's done.           

416
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,172
Bye, great party!               
And, uh, congratulations!       

417
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,708
          Marco,                
          what took you so long?

418
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,009
                You missed      
                the whole party.

419
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,712
       Yes, and where is        
       the glacier ice?         

420
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:59,583
         What? Oh, uh,          
they were all sold out... of it.

421
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,685
           Oh, I see.           

422
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,988
  I know I'm not always here,   

423
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,658
  so I got Marco Jr. this gift  
       to make up for it.       

424
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,026
                  Aw, how sweet.

425
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,929
                 Aw, how nice.  
                 You got us a...

426
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,197
           -painting!           
           -Ohh!                

427
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,999
                  You paid money
                  for that?     

428
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,500
  What are you talking about?   

429
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,035
          Whoa-ho-ho!           

430
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,270
What the heck?!                 

431
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,072
This doesn't                    
look like me at all!            

432
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,606
       It's like he got         
       the proportions all wrong

433
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,875
        and then tried to fix it
        by adding more detail   

434
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,211
                and more detail 
                and more detail.

435
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,580
              But, Marco,       
              it did not fix it.

436
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,616
  Well, it was a nice thought.  

437
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,754
        And then just as I      
        take off Marco's diaper,

438
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,256
              he pee-pees       
              all over my shirt!

439
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,192
        -[all laughing]         
        -Remember?              

440
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,594
C'mon, Marco,                   

441
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,730
     I thought you loved it     
     when Dad told stories      
     about when you were a baby.

442
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,265
No, I'm fine.                   

443
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,401
              Uh, Marco, what's 
              that on your face?

444
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,704
Huh? Oh.                        
Did I get it?                   

445
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,607
            Um... yeah,         
            no, no, not exactly.

446
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,608
    Marco?                      

447
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,577
    Your face!                  

448
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,645
         It looks like-- [gasps]

449
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,315
              It looks          
              like the painting!

450
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,817
Oh! Ha ha, guys. I get it,      
the portrait stinks,            

451
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,619
but, y'know,                    
I was just trying to do         

452
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,254
something that Marco Jr.        
could remember me by            

453
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,623
when I was-- mrrf mrrf mrrf.    

454
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,725
[mumbling]                      

455
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,993
[garbled]                       
What's happening?               

456
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,761
 [whimpering]                   
 What's happening?!             

457
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,631
    Oh, I knew it was a bad idea
    to rush a magical portrait! 

458
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,666
[mumbled shouting]              

459
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,735
           Marco, don't use     
           that kind of language
           at the table.        

460
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,836
[mumbles sadly]                 

461
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,139
    Oh! Maybe if we destroy     
         the painting,          

462
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,907
    it will break the spell.    

463
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,910
             [Star]             
       Laser-beam blast!        

464
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,111
           Anything?            

465
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,147
I think it's getting worse?     

466
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,681
           [mumbled]            
      It's getting worse?!      

467
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,684
      Well, guess there's       
      only one thing left to do.

468
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,520
                      [Cobalt]  
                      Very nice.

469
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,288
    Now if you could just turn  
    your cheek a little to the--

470
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,656
[Star] Cobalt!                  

471
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,924
Look what your painting         
did to Marco's face.            

472
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,693
       [speaking angrily]       

473
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:50,828
             It's getting worse!

474
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,663
The painting                    
is just a reflection            

475
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,632
of his answers                  
in the Essence Test,            

476
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,033
and if there's                  
any discrepancies,              

477
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,269
the painting will adjust        
you to match the portrait.      

478
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,837
No extra charge!                

479
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,439
          Okay, there's gotta be
          some way to fix this. 

480
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
           We tried destroying  
           the painting,        
           but that didn't work.

481
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,778
True art can never              
be destroyed. [chuckles]        

482
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,947
You'll need to take             
the Essence Test again,         

483
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,817
and you must answer             
the questions truthfully.       

484
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,719
                      [mumbling]

485
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,355
           [cracking]           

486
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,357
           [mumbling]           

487
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,227
    [dramatic music playing]    

488
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,368
          I got it!             
          What the...           

489
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,838
           [cracking]           

490
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,579
          [whimpering]          

491
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,181
           Oh, no! He can't take
           the exam like that!  

492
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,716
C'mon!                          

493
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,918
          Don't worry, we'll    
          take the test for you.

494
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,888
       After all who understands
       the mind of a teenage boy

495
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,723
    better than his own parents?

496
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,325
Mrmpf!                          

497
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,727
           -[groans]            
        -[all screaming]        

498
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,763
   He's becoming the canvas.    
      You'd better hurry.       

499
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,099
      Okay! Question one--      

500
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,903
 "Which do you prefer to ride?  
 A: a bicycle B: a unicycle     

501
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,172
         C: a tricycle          
       D: a Dragoncyc--"        

502
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,740
     What's a Dragoncycle?      

503
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,741
                   I don't know.

504
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,076
            Remember            
     when Marco was little      

505
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,711
   and had that red tricycle?   

506
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,346
                  [Mr. Diaz]    
                  He loved that!

507
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,514
           That's it!           
   The answer is C: tricycle!   

508
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,116
Mrs. Diaz!                      
We don't have much time!        

509
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,951
We have to be really careful    
these answers are perfect!      

510
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,553
    That's what we're doing!    

511
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,255
     If you could get off       
     the [straining] sheet!     

512
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,756
         -Oi!                   
         -Sorry, dear!          

513
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,358
              I am not bleeding.
              It is okay.       

514
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,360
That's great!                   
But I don't know                
if your answers                 

515
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,928
really capture                  
the Marco of today.             

516
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,296
                  Of course not.

517
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,765
            The Marco of today  
            is very frightening.

518
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,933
[whimpering]                    

519
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,535
No, I just mean                 
he's grown up--                 

520
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,970
          Sure,                 
          but I know my own son.

521
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,805
Sorry, but The answer           
is D: Dragoncycle.              

522
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,906
                          Marco?

523
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,908
[sadly]                         
Mrf. Uh-huh.                    

524
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,578
               Oh, I was wrong  
               about my own son?

525
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,781
                    This is sad.

526
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,217
       Star, get this test done.

527
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,385
All right,                      
let's do this thing.            

528
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,986
               Okay.            
               "How old are you?

529
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,555
                   A: zero to 15
                   B: 16 to 25  

530
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,923
                   C: 26 to 35."

531
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,258
            -Um...              
            -Hmm...             

532
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,926
         You two have           
         some catching up to do.

533
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,162
       Okay, "Have you ever worn
       a dress? A: Yes.         

534
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,830
        Do you prefer cornshakes
        or corn malts?"         

535
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,233
      Malts, duh. Next question.

536
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,635
                      And, done!

537
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,870
                       [panting]

538
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,415
              Huh?              

539
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,949
Oh, Marco,                      
you're beautiful again!         

540
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,951
                   Thanks, Star.

541
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,787
                       Mom, Dad?

542
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,624
         I guess we have        
         some catching up to do.

543
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,193
My beautiful son                
is all grown up!                

544
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,162
            I should            
       have visited more.       

545
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:41,332
 I don't want Marco Jr. growing 
  up without knowing who I am.  

546
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,200
         Visit anytime, sweetie.

547
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,602
             I mean,            
             those scissors work
             both ways, right?  

548
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,804
                     Snip, snip?

549
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,872
This is                         
a beautiful family moment.      

550
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,608
And I just happen to be runnin' 
a special on family portraits.
