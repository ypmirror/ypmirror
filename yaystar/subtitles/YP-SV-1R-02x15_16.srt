22
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,523
        lunch is served.

25
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,396
         You know, Lord Wildrew 
               is still single. 

26
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,999
                 Never too late 
         to start over, dearie. 

27
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,102
Yes, Aunt Etheria,              
I heard you the first           
hundred times.                  

28
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:12,938
        May I present           
      the first course?         

29
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,308
   Check out this big girl      
sitting at the grown-up table!  

30
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,613
  I'm too old to be sitting     
 at this stupid kids' table.    

31
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,450
               It's not stupid. 
           We get all the Mewni 
                  corn we want. 

32
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:27,619
                  It's so good. 
              My man here knows 
        what I'm talking about. 

33
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,455
 Right, hungry buddy?           

34
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,258
       I mean, really,          
        sippy goblets.          

35
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,531
        Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
           What's the big deal? 

36
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,101
   All the fun is happening     
         over there.            

37
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,608
      ( slurping loudly )       

38
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,446
 Oh, it's starting to happen.   

39
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,747
                What's starting 
                     to happen? 

40
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,417
        Grown-up stuff.         

41
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,385
    ( all talking at once )     

42
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,555
     There's no need for        
  any of this, I just want--    

43
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,492
You Johansens                   
spoiled my appetite             

44
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,394
like you've spoiled             
the Butterfly family tree.      

45
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,664
  Let's put a stop to this.     
           Tut-tut.             

46
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,468
Your neck ruffles are choking   
off the oxygen to your brain.   

47
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,637
           - River!             
         - You... oh!           

48
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,672
   Yes, of course, of course.   

49
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,274
      ( clears throat )         
          Now, now.             

50
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,176
       There's no need for      
       all this back and forth  

51
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,777
      about who's better        
          than who.             

52
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,413
      We're all royalty,        
         as you know.           

53
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,283
    There is a way we can       
  settle this petty dispute     

54
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,753
      like the civilized        
        people we are.          

55
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:38,290
          With flags!!          

56
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,192
       Flag!                    

57
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,260
           Oh, dear.            

58
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:42,728
        It's about time.        

59
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,265
      I've been thinking        
     about this all year.       

60
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,470
                Come on, Marco. 
                    Let's play. 

61
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,971
              All we have to do 
                is be the first 

62
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,674
               to get this flag 
                      up there. 

63
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,876
Oh, like                        
king of the hill.               

64
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,711
 I rock at that game.           

65
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,280
                Not that hill.  

66
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,484
         - That hill.           
            - Oh.               

67
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,119
    And the winner gets to      
  look down on everyone else    

68
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,321
       for a whole year.        

69
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,290
    I am so ready for this.     

70
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,892
          - No way.             
    - Hey. That's my flag.      

71
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,527
           You can have it back 
               after the match. 

72
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,462
               but you won't be 
           playing Flags today. 

73
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,132
  Why not? You played Flags     
    when you were my age.       

74
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:23,302
   - I did a lot of things      
     you won't be doing.        
         - ( groans )           

75
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,904
   I know it's boring to be     
the oldest at the kids' table,  

76
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:29,541
           but you're not ready 
             to be the youngest 
          at the adults' table. 

77
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:33,245
    Now go and help your little 
       cousins chew their corn. 

78
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,514
         I'll show her.         

79
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,250
    I can play this game,       
       and I will win.          

80
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,485
                Come on, Marco. 
           You're on Team Star. 

81
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,188
        But you heard your mom. 
         We're supposed to stay 
            at the kids' table. 

82
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,756
        Don't you worry.        

83
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,325
     We'll be sitting at        
       the kids' table.         

84
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,860
    The game will commence      
    when all participants       

85
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,063
       are at the ready.        

86
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:54,266
            So if both sides of 
        your family are playing 
            against each other, 

87
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,034
           whose side are we on?

88
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,569
 Duh. Our side.                 

89
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,739
      Here's to another         
   spirited game of Flags.      

90
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,243
   Let us not have a repeat     
of last year's unfortunateness. 

91
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,677
        What happened           
          last year?            

92
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,412
Just before he                  
reached the peak,               

93
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,781
Uncle Lump                      
got his body cut off.           

94
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,750
           - What?!             
     - Relax. He's fine.        

95
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,585
     He's right over there.     

96
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,787
         Neigh, neigh.          

97
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,756
I think he likes it             
better this way.                

98
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,293
        Ready, set...           
            flags.              

99
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,664
       Here we go, Marco.       

100
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,967
      And both families         
      are at the course.        

101
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,402
      The Johansens take        
        an early lead,          

102
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,037
     but the Butterflies        
   are making up the slack.     

103
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,513
        That's my girl.         

104
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,990
       Star, little help.       

105
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,426
         Oh, here, my dear boy. 
        Allow me to assist you. 

106
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,662
        - Hey, thanks.          
         - Marco, no!           

107
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,801
 By my troth, you must surely   
     ate it on that one.        

108
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,238
       Smooch my royal          
        hindquarters.           

109
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,841
          - Toodles!            
       - Nice takedown,         
       Uncle Heartrude.         

110
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,811
          - Let go!             
         - You good?            

111
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,614
Why did you congratulate him?   
      He pulled me down.        

112
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,982
         That's Flags.          

113
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,818
     That's how you play.       
    We gotta keep moving.       

114
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,821
    Prithee, may I accept       
       some assistance?         

115
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,823
                      Dream on, 
                Uncle Jerkface. 

116
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,292
      Whoa sakes. I have        
        not the choice          

117
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,861
            but to              
   gnaw off my own fibula.      

118
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,364
               We're going into 
                 the rain zone. 

119
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,599
      ( thunder rumbling )      

120
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,001
            Oh, no.             

121
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,705
I can do king of the hill,      
I can not do wet socks.         

122
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,274
             Flags doesn't care 
                 what you like. 

123
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,242
           We gotta keep moving.

124
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,945
       Out of the way,          
          old lady.             

125
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,454
       - Wait a minute.         
 - Eyes on the prize, Marco.    

126
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,755
          ( laughing )          

127
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,326
Star, we gotta                  
go back.                        

128
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,894
         We are never           
         going back.            

129
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,339
 I think your family's really   
  trying to hurt each other.    

130
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,041
    Yeah. Isn't it awesome?     

131
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,976
Not again, not again,           
not again.                      

132
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,911
    And there's the repeat      
        of last year.           

133
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,081
      Adieu, Uncle Lump.        
   Who shall take the hill?     

134
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,451
      I am beside myself        
      with anticipation.        

135
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,057
                   Star.        

136
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,493
       Look at my girl,         
         all grown up           

137
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,061
       and playing Flags.       

138
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,764
           You make me so proud.

139
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,799
   Aw, Dad, you're so sweet.    

140
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,269
Great job, honey.               

141
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,904
     You just threw your...     

142
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,572
You got me.                     

143
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,274
     You just threw your...     

144
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:54,045
 ( muttering indistinctly )     

145
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,716
   You just threw your dad      
       down a mountain.         

146
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:58,950
            Haven't you figured 
                    it out yet? 

147
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,786
           You don't waste time 
                    on anybody. 

148
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,421
                        Keep up.

149
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,094
 And the herd of participants   
   is being further culled.     

150
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,930
 There is now only a handful    
vying for the top of the hill.  

151
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,933
    So dreadfully exciting.     

152
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,302
 Lady Etheria and Lord Grunt    
        lead the pack           

153
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,105
with a late appearance from...  
           oh, my.              

154
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,040
  The Princess Star Butterfly.  

155
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,708
             What?              

156
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,148
                     Star?      

157
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,007
    You've been a stone in      
  my poulaines for too long,    

158
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,810
 my incorrigible little niece!  

159
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,246
       You're about to          
     abdicate the throne!       

160
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,722
 What is she doing?             

161
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,661
        Marco, come on.         

162
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,630
Star, this game                 
is changing you.                

163
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,866
It's not about                  
who versus who                  

164
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,634
or rivalries                    
or whatever.                    

165
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,436
It's about winning              
no matter what.                 

166
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,204
And that's just                 
not you.                        

167
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,110
  Eat this.                     

168
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,721
Let's just go back              
down the hill.                  

169
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,095
Star.                           

170
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,872
      She's got our flags.      

171
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,908
            Get her!            

172
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,878
         Get our flags.         

173
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,050
Give me flag.                   

174
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,985
         Give it to me!         

175
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,268
              Mom?              

176
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,275
     - Are you all right?       
       - Oh, man, Mom,          

177
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,377
          those are             
    some sweet magic moves      

178
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,113
   with your big old wings      
          and stuff.            

179
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,683
      Star, you're never        
      going to believe,         

180
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,018
        but I just met          
      your twin sister.         

181
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,120
         She was made           
         out of corn.           

182
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,890
    I don't even remember       
     giving birth to her.       

183
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:56,127
 River, did I ever give birth   
       to a corn baby?          

184
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,964
No. I'm afraid                  
we just have the one            
child, my dear.                 

185
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,565
               Thank you, River.

186
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,467
       The name is Star.        

187
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,303
            Okay. Why don't you 
            just lay back down? 
                     Thank you. 

188
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,771
      You see what Flags        
     does to your brain?        

189
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,141
     I'm sorry I tried to       
 trick you with my corn twin.   

190
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,210
    And maybe you're right.     

191
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,079
        Maybe I'm not           
       ready for Flags.         

192
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,281
  But maybe the real problem    
    is that Flags is dumb.      

193
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,316
                    I found her.

194
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,585
                 Star Butterfly.

195
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,221
                Our only child, 
                       my dear. 

196
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,489
             Okay.              

197
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,157
                         Hungry.

198
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,560
    I was trying to bring       
       all these flags          

199
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,161
    to the top of the hill.     

200
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,597
     Not so that I could        
   win the hill for myself,     

201
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,100
          but to claim the hill 
                 for all of us! 

202
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,168
          ( cheering )          

203
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,270
        Who wants food?         

204
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:43,274
That's the most adult           
thing I've heard all day.       

205
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,310
 I misjudged you, Star.         

206
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,946
You earned a rightful seat      
at the grown-up table.          

207
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,347
                        Hug!    

208
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,950
    Star, public displays       
         of affection           

209
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,918
   aren't a Butterfly virtue.   

210
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,854
                 The Johansens, 
             on the other hand, 

211
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,522
              are amazing at it.

212
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:01,259
  You are the perfect blend     
 of both sides of the family.   

213
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,161
       I'm proud of you.        

214
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,096
          Thanks, Mom.          

215
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,998
  Only an idiot would wanna     
        win this game.          

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,533
                       Whoo hoo!

217
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,301
                I'm the winner. 
              King of the hill. 

218
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,203
                  In your face. 
                      Uh-uh-uh. 

219
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,610
     Now, when you carry        
          the four,             

220
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:23,214
let V be the finite             
dimensional vector              
space over K.                   

221
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,051
Where we're                     
solving for K...                

222
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:29,220
             ( loud sigh )      

223
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,655
( Skullnick continues )         

224
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,658
             'Sup?              

225
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,228
     For cosine localized       
     algebra, we write K.       

226
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,197
             Blaah!             

227
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:44,335
( teacher continues             
in monotone )                   

228
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,770
             Okay.              

229
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,076
   Fly free, little Marisol!    

230
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,247
         - ( yells )            
          - Oh, no.             

231
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,749
            Be free!            

232
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,418
 Why did you do that?           

233
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,388
          Because she was bored!

234
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,056
                We're all bored!

235
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,925
        She's bored, he's bored,

236
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,827
            he's bored, Marco's 
              definitely bored. 

237
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,662
Don't drag me                   
into this.                      

238
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,530
     Bored out of his mind.     

239
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,932
           That's it.           

240
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,266
         - Detention.           
         - For that?            

241
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,269
       Marco, go get my hamster.

242
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:22,407
         Viva Marisol!          

243
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,610
             Oof!               
          ( growls )            

244
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,646
    Sit in there and think      
about what you did, hooligan.   

245
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,852
         'Sup, Star?            
      Welcome to D-ten.         

246
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,287
              Looks like you're 
                 one of us now. 

247
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,228
   Math cage, hamster cage,     
       detention cage.          

248
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,929
      You guys can stay         
     in here if you want,       

249
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,464
     but I won't be caged.      

250
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,266
        I'm outta here.         

251
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,768
     Oh, yeah, that's cool.     

252
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,704
   I mean, you were elected     
     mayor of detention,        

253
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,806
       - but whatever.          
      It's no big deal.         
           - What?              

254
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:59,277
 Yeah. It says so right here    
        on this thing.          

255
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,079
        This paper...           
       piece of paper.          

256
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,380
      But I just got here.      

257
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,716
      No, no, I get it.         
          It's cool.            

258
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,384
        The mayor has           
 more important things to do.   

259
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,487
     Uh, hey, everybody,        
  can I have your attention?    

260
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,223
          Listen up.            
    I have some bad news.       

261
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,592
 The mayor is busy and won't    
  be able to help us today,     

262
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:19,030
    so I guess we'll just       
   go back to our previous      
      system of anarchy.        

263
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,934
 ( glass shatters )             

264
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:26,337
       Let me see that.         
      Hey. This is fake.        

265
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,072
    Every election is fake.     

266
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,941
     What does the mayor        
    of detention even do?       

267
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,944
  Well, the townspeople have    
     a list of requests.        

268
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:36,414
            And the mayor, you, 
                  fulfill them. 

269
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,986
Let's get this over with.       

270
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,522
                    Candy.      

271
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,358
 Tattoo.                        

272
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,195
And comb.                       

273
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,539
       Well, looks like         
    my work here is done.       

274
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,541
        See you, guys.          
Won't be needing this anymore.  

275
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,210
 ( crying )                     

276
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,781
  What's up with Waterworks     
         over there?            

277
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,784
        Oh, that's Toby.        

278
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,185
  Yeah, but why is he crying?   

279
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,720
      Oh, he's just bummed      

280
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,856
     'cause he didn't get       
   his request in on time.      

281
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,525
     - Not your problem.        
         - Ugh. Okay.           

282
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,228
    Fine. One last thing,       
      but then I'm gone.        

283
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,063
   Toby, what's your request?   

284
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,564
         Well, usually,         

285
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,701
     we all gather around       
 this little window like so,    

286
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,471
    and we watch wrestling      
  on the TV across the hall.    

287
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:37,542
       I can control it         
   with this stolen remote.     

288
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,811
     Except the batteries       
          are dead.             

289
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,813
 Worst timing ever.             

290
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,650
The Junior Mustache             
is fighting the Sterling        
Stallion at 4:00 p.m.           

291
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,054
    So where we gonna get       
 fresh batteries, Miss Mayor?   

292
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,390
                  Hmmm.         

293
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,459
     - ( music playing )        
         - ( gasps )            

294
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,197
      That's it. Oskar's        
    keytar uses batteries.      

295
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,632
 I like your style.             

296
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,838
       Come out, Marisol.       

297
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,540
        - Here, baby.           
       - ( squeaking )          

298
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,076
      Fine. I'm comin' in.      

299
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,751
          Aw, come on.          

300
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,622
              Huh?              

301
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,425
                Oh, hey, Jackie.

302
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,427
 Do you need some help?         

303
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,297
               Just hangin' out.

304
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,132
I drew up a plan.               

305
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,567
We'll cross the field           
to the parking lot,             

306
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,569
but we have to get back         
by 1:00 p.m. sharp.             

307
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,272
That's when Skullnick           
checks in every day             
for roll call.                  

308
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,642
The school ground's             
a harsh, unforgiving landscape  

309
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,444
 not to be taken lightly.       

310
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,514
                 ( yelling )    

311
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,119
First, we gotta get past        
the fall hall.                  

312
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,792
Next, we must blend in          
with band practice.             

313
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,564
                    And lastly, 
                Miss Skullnick. 

314
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,568
I got it.                       
Shimmering destructo cannon.    

315
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,974
         How about we call that 
                        Plan B? 

316
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,477
        I was thinking we could 
            just scare her away 
                     with this. 

317
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,346
         Potato chips!          

318
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,314
        I don't get it.         

319
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,584
          Not chips.            
            This.               

320
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,787
Aw, he's so cute.               

321
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,557
       ( chewing loudly )       

322
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,497
    Oh, when did I pack you?    

323
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,100
  Sour cream and ham flavored?  

324
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,035
          My favorite.          

325
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,671
      Oooh, I better not.       

326
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,840
      Oh, but what could        
        one chip hurt?          

327
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,509
     Who are you kidding,       
          Margaret?             

328
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,044
      You wouldn't just         
         stop at one.           

329
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,613
   But you have been doing      
your water aerobics every day,  

330
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,448
      so you deserve this.      

331
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,620
     What's going on here?      

332
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,658
      ( kids chattering,        
      cameras clicking )        

333
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,562
      They better not be having 
         fun on school grounds. 

334
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:15,233
   Don't worry. I have him      
     pretty much wrapped        
      around my finger.         

335
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,168
 Let me do the talking.         

336
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,369
Hey there, Oskar.               

337
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,338
We'd like to borrow your...     

338
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,708
      ( Star shuddering )       

339
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,546
               Uh, Madame Mayor.

340
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,915
                   Batteries.   

341
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,583
 ( stammering )                 

342
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,920
                   Mayor. Star! 
                Ugh, forget it. 

343
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,556
      Hey, Oskar, can we borrow 
          your keytar batteries 
            to watch wrestling? 

344
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,659
  There is no cause worthier    
   than the wrestling arts.     

345
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,765
    Great. I'll just take       
    those batteries then.       

346
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,867
No, you can't have these.       
I gotta keep jammin'.           

347
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,837
But I have a spare set          
of batteries in the trunk.      

348
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,807
 Somewhere in one of these.     

349
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,444
                      Batteries!

350
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:00,778
                      Nailed it.

351
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,715
         I hope you didn't hurt 
              my sweet Marisol. 

352
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,417
No, I'm fine, thanks.           

353
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,885
     Where's the stuck kid?     

354
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,621
           - Ahem.              
     - It's probably him.       

355
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,724
  Don't worry, little fella.    
We'll get you out in no time.   

356
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,526
       Wait. Wait, wait!        

357
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,061
         Is this safe?          

358
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,763
             Yeah, I'll be fine.

359
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,134
         - All free.            
          - Finally!            

360
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,003
  Whoo, I don't have to look    
   like an idiot anymore...     

361
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,908
                        Marisol!

362
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,444
       My little Marisol.       

363
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,746
         ( smooching )          

364
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,715
     It's almost time to        
  check on the degenerates.     

365
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,219
      You wanna check on        
  the degenerates, Marisol?     

366
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,254
         Yes, you do,           
         yes, you do.           

367
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,824
OSKAR: Oh, yeah, this bad boy   
   is one of my favorites.      

368
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:50,261
  I got it near that library    
 that serves the best tacos.    

369
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,763
  That is such a great story.   

370
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,733
       ( phone buzzing )        

371
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,504
      - Mayor Butterfly,        
      it's almost 1:00.         
            - Ah!               

372
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,639
               No, not this one.

373
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,674
            - No.               
           - Zilch.             

374
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,009
           - Nope.              
            - Aha!              

375
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,612
         Thanks, Oskar.         

376
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:08,946
          No problem.           

377
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:12,150
    ( making keytar sounds )    

378
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,354
            Get in.             

379
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,389

       transformation!          

380
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,804
    GIRL: Those girls are       
          so weird.             

381
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,175
     Oh, my little Marisol.     

382
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,843
That cloud                      
looks like a tree.              

383
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,879
      And that one looks        
        like... aaah!           

384
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,815
Oh, yeah, that one              
does look like an aaaah!        

385
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,618
       ( kids screaming )       

386
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,719
          ( laughing )          

387
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,322
           Skullnick.           

388
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,791
           - Star.

389
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,544
                  STAR: Made it.

390
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,317
       Oh, you must be          
          so hungry.            

391
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,820
    Aren't you? How about       
    something to eat, huh?      

392
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,258
      ( anguished shriek )      

393
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,734
       Has anyone seen          
         my Marisol?            

394
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,903
   Oh, you mean this Marisol?   

395
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,339
       Oh, I'm so sorry.        

396
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,775
        Does this mean          
   we can leave detention?      

397
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,110
              No!
