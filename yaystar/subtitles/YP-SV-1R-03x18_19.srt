00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,477
and then there were             
all these Goblin Dogs           

41
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,746
that were also flying,          
and then I ate them.

47

48

I am not-- ( burps )

            Ew, a receipt!      

51
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,868

52

     -How is that possible?     

53
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,907
I have no idea.                 

54
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,544
Okay, Marco,                    
you know the plan.              

55
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,012
You stay up all night and see   

56
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,347
if whatever happened last night 
happens again tonight.          

57
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,683
            But then what?      
            Shouldn't we tell   
            somebody about this?

58
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,851
       -I mean, what if--       
            -Marco!             

59
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,453
Shall I remind you              
you are my squire?              

60
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,490
So I order you to sit there     
and watch me sleep.             

61
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,559
            -Okay.              
            -Good.              

62
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,528
    Oh, and don't tell Tom      
    about this, either.         

63
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,230
            Oh, heck no.        

64
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,498
        Good! Good night.       

65
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,900
        Aah, Glossaryck!        

66
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,202
            Mm, Glabgor.        

67
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,872
        All right, but just     
        for a little while.     

68
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,709
        You're so... warm...    
             and cozy.          

69
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,885
          -Wha! Whoa!           
             -Star?             

70
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,857
           ( gasps )

        ( zooming noise )       

75
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,413
    -Star, wake up!             
    -( giggles ) Hey, buddy.    

76
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,016
    There's definitely          
    something weird going on.   

77
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,218
                ( panting )     

78
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,786
Marco, what happened?           

79
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,955
            I might've dozed off
            for a minute,       

80
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,190
            but when I opened   
            my eyes,            

81
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,292
        you had opened a portal 
        and gone through it.    

82
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,094
Without dimensional scissors?   

83
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,063
    You came out of the portal  
    as that big scary thing     

84
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,399
    you turned into             
    when you defeated Toffee.   

85
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,235
Well, that shouldn't            
be happening.                   

86
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,971
   So, Mom! You know that big   
        butterfly thing         

87
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,973
       you can transform        
   into when you get all mad    

88
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,208
            and feel            
      like scaring people?      

89
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,077
    It's not                    
    for scaring people, Star.   

90
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,646
             Right.             
      Right, right, right.      

91
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,448
  So, does that ever happen...  
        unintentionally?        

92
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,083
            Well, it starts     
            with muberty,       

93
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,153
            but after that,     
            it requires years   
            of training.        

94
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,822
        Oh, good.               
        Good, good, good.       

95
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,892
        But what if it just     
        sort of happened...     

96
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,594
                randomly?       

97
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,997
            Star, it doesn't    
            happen randomly,    

98
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,634
            okay, it happens... 
            in times of need,   

99
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,070
            like when you       
            defeated Toffee.    

100
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,341
       But what if it...        
      did happen randomly?      

101
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,476
          Catastrophe!          

102
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,679
     ( hearty laugh ) Yes!      

103
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,181
    -We'd have to put you       
     in the dungeon!            
    -River--                    

104
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,417
      No! Then the magical      
   high commission would come   

105
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,851
       and take you away!       

106
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,087
        There'd be weeks        
        of examinations.        

107
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,656
        You'd be locked         
         away forever!          

108
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,024
          ( chortles )          

109
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,359
                River, please.  

110
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,927
    I mean, if this happened,   

111
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,030
    eventually we'd just have   
    to adopt a new princess.    

112
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,865
                  River, enough!

113
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,468
            Star, is everything 
            all right?          

114
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:08,039
     Oh! Yes. Everything is     
   totally normal, obviously.   

115
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,108
       I was just asking        
   so that I can be prepared    

116
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,310
          to handle it          
       if I ever do learn       

117
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,680
     to transform like you      
          on purpose.           

118
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,981
Queen Moon--                    

119
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,216
           -( thunk )           
             -Ouch!             

120
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,852
I... have nothing to say.       

121
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,754
     ( crickets chirping )      

122
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,858
   Food truck bed transform!    

123
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,326
           ( whirrs )           

124
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,562
        All right, Marco,       
        let's try this again.   

125
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,304
         So... this'll keep you 
             from morphing      

126
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,307
        into Butterfly Star?    

127
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,909
    Yep! Don't worry,           
    Marco, I got this.          

128
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,878
            But even your mom   
            seemed concerned--  

129
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,247
My parents cannot               
know about this!                

130
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,915
You heard what Dad said!        

131
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,084
"Locked away forever!"          

132
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,487
        I think he was          
        exaggerating a little.  

133
00:05:55,522 --> 00:06:00,058
Marco, my squire,               
you are the only person         
I can trust with this.          

134
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,227
Promise me                      
you won't doze off again.       

135
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,262
            Don't worry,        
            not gonna happen.   

136
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,264
        And even if it does,    
        this chain will alert me

137
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,933
        any time you move,      
        and I'll wake up, too.  

138
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,201
Thanks, Marco.                  

139
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,437
( sighs ) Good night.           

140
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,074
                Aah! Glossaryck!

141
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,609
        Oh, no, you don't.      

142
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,744
        You're not making me    
        fall asleep this time!  

143
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,113
            Out you go.         

144
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,349
            Globgor?            

145
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,084
     ( crickets chirping )      

146
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,787
          ( snoring )           

147
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,356
       ( mystical music )       

148
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,724
              Ohh!              

149
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,925
              Huh?              

150
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,996
        -( Marco gasps )        
        -( Star grunts )        

151
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,103
             Star!              

152
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,107
             Oh, no. Aah!       

153
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,977
        Whoa! Uhh! Uhh!         

154
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,780
            Huh? Aah!           

155
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,249
            What the--?         

156
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,757
            Aah! Whoa!          

157
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,328
             Wha--!             

158
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,064
            ( grunting )        

159
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,866
            Star! Wake up!      

160
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,070
        Marco?                  

161
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,272
            I need you to fly us
            back to that portal!

162
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,909
        Portal? Oh...           

163
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,813
        ( determined grunt )    

164
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,051
              Huh?              

165
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,620
        You're easily...        

166
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,291
        ( both wailing )        

167
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,060
Oh, no, no, no.                 

168
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,034
    What?                       

169
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,769
       ( both screaming )       

170
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,339
       ( impact grunts )        

171
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,608
        Are you two all right?  

172
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,110
Eclypsa! I am so glad           
you're here.                    

173
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,879
Wait a minute.                  
Why are you here?               

174
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:04,182
I'm returning this little guy   
after he wandered into my tower.

175
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,117
        Eclypsa! ( gasps )      

176
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,953
    Isn't she                   
    that ancient evil queen     
    everyone's talking about?   

177
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,488
We don't trust you              
one bit!                        

178
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,691
    Oh, are you afraid I'll get 
    my evil cooties on you?     

179
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,893
Stay back, woman!               

180
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,160
                What's this?    

181
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,029
            Some sort of sword  
            hand dance?         

182
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,130
                This looks fun. 

183
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,398
Don't come any closer!          

184
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,467
        Marco, she's really     
        not dangerous.          

185
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,702
-Aren't you adorable!           
-Who are you calling adorable?  

186
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,238
          STAR: Stop!           
      I have had ten times      

187
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,040
   my daily dose of weirdness   
       in the last hour,        

188
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,209
     so let's just call it      
         a night, okay?         

189
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,044
          What? You can't just--

190
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,314
 -Nope. No, no, no, nope, nope. 
            -But--!             

191
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,550
           ( groans )           

192
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,219
            Eclypsa! Wait.      
            Wait. Wait. Wait.   

193
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,054
            I need to ask       
            you something.      

194
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,323
            ( sighs ) So,       
            that's about it.    

195
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,727
    Every night I still go all  
    "Rah! Butterfly monster!"   

196
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,496
            Oh, I just wish     
            I could stop it.    

197
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,231
Do you need to stop it?         

198
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,934
  You saw what happened tonight.
  It was horrible!              

199
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,070
What about the other times?     
Were they so horrible?          

200
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,738
        Well, no, not exactly.  

201
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,441
        In fact,                
        they were really fun.   

202
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,177
        They were actually      
        the most amazing dreams 
        I've ever had.          

203
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,246
I wouldn't run                  
from these dreams.              

204
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,781
I would embrace them,           

205
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,050
see where they take me.         

206
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,253
    Really? You think I should  
    just let them happen?       

207
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,189
It's the only way to learn      
what you're truly capable of.   

208
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,857
All knowledge                   
is good knowledge,              

209
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,193
I always say!                   

210
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,195
Well, I should get back         
to my tower                     

211
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,097
before the guards               
realize I'm missing.            

212
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,900
    Oh, yeah, how did you       
    break out of there, anyway? 

213
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,468
            I thought you were  
            under tower arrest. 

214
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,570
So long as we're                
spilling secrets--              

215
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,573
Oh, Captain!                    
Permission to come aboard?      

216
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,308
        ( bell clangs )         

217
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,310
             What?!             

218
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,145
          I never knew          
        that was there!         

219
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,149
Yes, I used these secret tunnels
constantly when I was your age. 

220
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,219
         All knowledge          
  is good knowledge, my dear.   

221
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,587
     ( crickets chirping )      

222
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,725
    Okay, so the chains         
were a bust, but how about--?   

223
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,728
Actually, Marco, I don't need   
you to watch me tonight.        

224
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,231
    Oh! Did you figure out      
    how to stop transforming?   

225
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,334
No, but I thought               
maybe I should see              

226
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,270
what I'm capable of,            
or whatever.                    

227
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,773
            Star, you don't know
            anything about this.

228
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,576
Yeah, and I'll never know       
anything about it               

229
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,945
if I keep trying                
to stop it.                     

230
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,116
I know it's weird,              
but I really need               
to see this through, okay?      

231
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,985
        Okay, I guess, but could
        you at least take       

232
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,620
        my dimensional scissors 
        with you                

233
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,589
        in case you get trapped?

234
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:30,194
Sorry, Marco,                   
but if I'm gonna do this,       
I can't do it halfway.          

235
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,097
            Okay, fine!         
            I tried to help!    

236
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,999
            No one can say      
            I didn't try!       

237
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,201
            Because I tried.    

238
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,537
        So if you die out there,

239
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,606
        don't go blaming me,    
             all right?         

240
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,374
        - All right!            
        - All right!            

241
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,711
            Well...             
            good luck out there.

242
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,563
            Globgor.            

243
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,901
  Yeah, Gloss, I'm not sure she 
    can do this alone, either.  

244
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,074
     MAN: Deep in the sand,     
     a wicked ember glows,      

245
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,177
       though all around,       
   a chilling wind doth blow.   

246
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,213
      With heat and spark       
      and smoke uncurled,       

247
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:26,618
     bring forth the fires      
       of the underworld!       

248
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,423
-( laughter )                   
-( playfully ) Get back here!   
I'm gonna claw you in the head! 

249
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,427
I love how ♪ spooky ♪           
underworld beaches are.         

250
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,430
    Isn't that kind of...       
    the underworld's thing?     

251
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,365
        Yeah, it's pretty metal.

252
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,402
            Hey, Star, finished 
            your marshmallow.   

253
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,605
Aw, I finished                  
yours, too! Twins.              

254
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,407
                  ( blowing )   

255
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:54,378
      Wait a second--           
      is that one of my hoodies?

256
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,047
Yeah, I gave him                
a spare one for the beach.      

257
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,615
            I gave it           
            a little custom job.

258
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,852
   -You want me to do yours?    
         -No! Oh, man!          

259
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,421
  ( sighs ) Kelly, can I have   
         one of yours?          

260
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,524
Um, I actually licked           
all of these.                   

261
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,426
        Yeah, okay, never mind. 

262
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,862
     Aw, it's okay, Marco,      
   you can have our last one.   

263
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,929
              Here you go, dude.

264
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,865
        Oh, man, the Soulrise   

265
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,234
        is gonna be             
        ♪ so great ♪ this year! 

266
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,470
    Hoo-yeah, and we got such   
    a good spot to watch it.    

267
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,306
        What are you jerks      
        doing in our spot?!     

268
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,275
            Your spot?          
            We were here first! 

269
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,310
        Yeah, I don't see       
        your name on it.        

270
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,379
            Well, maybe you     
            need more eyes.     

271
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,249
        Hey, back               
        off my girlfriend, man. 

272
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,451
Sounds like this guy's          
looking for a fight.            

273
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,553
        There's only one way    
        to settle this.         

274
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,388
        -( grunts )             
        -( gasps )              

275
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,090
          BOTH: Yeah!           

276
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,491
MARCO: How are                  
we settling this?               

277
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,293
     How are we settling this?  

278
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,129
           Let's go! Ugh!       

279
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,499
      ( players grunting )      

280
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,301
MARCO: I got it!                
I got it!                       

281
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,103
       Point, Team Ulric.       

282
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,238
            -Ha ha!             
             -Yah!              

283
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,475
          ( grunting )          

284
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,276
Kelly, it's yours!              

285
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,482
          -BOTH: What?          
       -That's cheating!        

286
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,751
            Hey, your friend    
            looked upset.       

287
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,686
            Maybe you should    
            check on her.       

288
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,423
          Kelly! Guys,          
      where did Kelly go?       

289
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,926
It's okay. We can               
still take these chumps.        

290
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,929
Star and I haven't even         
unleashed our secret weapon.    

291
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,430
    ( both whooping )           

292
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,133
        Fine. Marco will fix it.

293
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,234
( impact grunt )                

294
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,370
        Kelly?                  

295
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,972
            Did you say Skelly? 

296
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,874
    No, I said Kelly.           

297
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,343
What's up with Skelly?          
'Cause that's me.               

298
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,813
            Oh, hey. Hey, there.
            I'm Skelly, too.    

299
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,515
Have you guys                   
seen my friend?                 

300
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,017
       I don't know, man,       
       but I'll fight ya.       

301
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,520
I just wanna                    
find my friend.                 

302
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,790
She's, like, this tall          
and has a lot of body hair.     

303
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,191
    No?                         

304
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,826
            Sounds like         
            I could take her.   

305
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,361
        Two on two sound fair?  

306
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,797
Okay, well, uh,                 
thanks anyway.                  

307
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,332
            He seemed nice.     

308
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,539
Are... you okay?                

309
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,207
                    No...       

310
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,576
            Tad and I broke up. 

311
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,678
Oh... sorry.                    

312
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,681
I-- I mean, you guys            
will probably work it out.      

313
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,383
You always do, you know.        

314
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,419
            No. This is         
            very much the end.  

315
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,323
Oh. Well, I know                
how you feel.                   

316
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,192
Jackie and I                    
split up, too.                  

317
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:25,263
Hey, if you need                
to talk-- Aah!                  

318
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,064
           ( grunts,            
     yells in retaliation )     

319
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,599
Jorby, what                     
are you doing?                  

320
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,035
    Oh, I don't know, Kelly,    
        what are you doing?     

321
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,937
            Is this             
   your new sparring partner?   

322
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,172
            You know what?      
            I had to fight Greg.

323
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,843
        Greg! And I killed him  
        in, like, three seconds!

324
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,278
You didn't kill Greg.           

325
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,246
            Yeah, well,         
            I killed his pride. 

326
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,749
     Leave her alone, man!      
She's going through some stuff. 

327
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:48,452
We all are! Everyone's          
in a constant state             
of falling apart.               

328
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,454
Existential war cry!            

329
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,457
            Does everyone       
            on this stupid beach
            wanna fight?        

330
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:58,396
                   ( grunting ) 

331
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,465
        Stop! I cannot--        
           ( sighs )            

332
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,770
       I cannot deal with       
  this much static right now.   

333
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,440
Sorry, man, I didn't know.      

334
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,808
I'd help you talk to her,       

335
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,444
but I got my own lady           
I gotta deal with.              

336
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,946
        ( gibberish )           

337
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,548
    I'm coming!                 
    Oh, kill me.                

338
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,950
Kelly, wait up!                 

339
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,652
I just wanted to say            
if you need to talk--           

340
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,156
       ( sputters ) I don't know
       who I am anymore.        

341
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,160
      All I know is I'm tired   
      of being Tad's girlfriend,

342
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,462
    and I can't seem to move on.

343
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,597
That stuff takes time.          

344
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,466
                I know, but--   
                ( sighs )       

345
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,469
            Tad's still in here.

346
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,272
He'll always be in here,        
but it gets eas--               

347
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,474
            No, Marco, he hasn't
            moved out yet.      

348
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,277
            He's still in here. 

349
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,511
Wait, what?                     

350
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,313
       He just isn't getting it,

351
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,016
        and I've already hurt   
        him too much.           

352
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,518
I could try talking to him.     

353
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,355
            Really? Hmm, well.  

354
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,756
            Maybe he'll         
            listen to you.      

355
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,925
            You are             
            his best friend.    

356
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,260
( laughs nervously )            
       I am?                    

357
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,596
                Come on in.     

358
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,998
           -In there?           
             -Yeah.             

359
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,199
         -In your hair?         
             -Yeah!             

360
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:12,503
            Get in here! Get it?
            "Get in hair."      

361
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,181
Um, hey, Tad.                   

362
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,618
            Oh, hey, bestie.    

363
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,655
        ( sighs )               
        Kelly dumped me again.  

364
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,458
Yeah, that's why I'm here.      

365
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,160
She asked me                    
to come talk to you.            

366
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,561
                Are we getting  
                back together?  

367
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,631
No. She needs you               
to move out, bud.               

368
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,567
        She keeps saying that,  
        but I've been looking.  

369
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,803
Oh! That's great. Where?        

370
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,074
        Mm, like, on the back   
        of these pizza boxes?   

371
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,343
     Uh, inside these chip bags?

372
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,612
            At the bottom       
            of these soda pops? 

373
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,748
Look, dude, I felt              
the same way                    

374
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,216
when Jackie and I split.        

375
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,751
        That's your B., man.    

376
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,154
        Kelly and I break up    
        and make up constantly. 

377
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,256
        We'll get back together 
        in no time,             

378
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,859
      so why even bother        
      getting out of this chair?

379
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,063
Tad, it's for real this time.   

380
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,665
            You're harshing     
            my groove, Marco.   

381
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,601
Dude, Kelly wants to move on.   
You should give her that chance.

382
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,037
         -Come on, man!         
              -No!              

383
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,574
You're just making yourself     
miserable hanging around her.   

384
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,677
        ( sighs ) You're right. 

385
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,279
            You're the expert.  

386
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:31,082
Well, yeah, I'm an expert       
in many things-- Wait, what?    

387
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,450
What are you talking about?     

388
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,051
            How you're making   
            yourself miserable  

389
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,086
            hanging around Star.

390
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,787
What?! Psst.                    

391
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,689
What does Star                  
have to do with it?             

392
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,392
If anything,                    
I'm miserable because--         

393
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,627
because Jackie dumped me.       

394
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,097
    Marco, you didn't come here 
    for the Soulrise.           

395
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,631
Yes, I did.                     

396
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,635
       Oh, Marco, Marco,        
     Marco, Marco, Marco...

             -Shh.              

398
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,940
     I've been watching you     
           all night.           

399
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,409
       You have feelings        
  for your best friend, dude.   

400
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:03,080
What?! No! No. No...            

401
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,484
        Dude, you have          
        dimensional scissors!   

402
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,786
        You could be            
        knocking back soda pops 

403
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,388
        and crushing pizzas     
        in any dimension!       

404
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,959
        And you're choosing     
        to live with
