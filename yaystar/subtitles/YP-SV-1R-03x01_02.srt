Marco taught me a lot,          
like how to mope, self-pity,

00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,216

all the cool teen stuff,

00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,094
       [whispering] It looks    
       like they're just scouts.

124
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,329
        We'll let them--

Yeah! I did it!

           The big deal is

           put us in harm's way.

Are you okay?

    a little Sanctuary guardian?

161
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,285
No, he's the gatekeeper.        

162
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,286
          Wait, what?

for generations.

175
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,064
          into their pods

to open the Wellspring.

          to be all black       
          and goopy like that?

      how its supposed to look. 

184
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,600
[gasps] Its worse               
than I'd feared.                

185
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,602
              Mom?              

186
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,705
              We'll have        
              to go with plan B.

187
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,106
All right, plan B?              

188
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,808
What's plan B?                  

189
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,444
        We'll talk about that   
        after we get settled in.

190
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,713
Look at you, you're             
covered in scratches.           

191
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,214
Let's fix you up.

            [gasps]             
            What are you doing?!

193
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,319
Star, what do                   
you want me to do?              

194
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,555
It's in tatters already.        

195
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,992
                        Uh, Mom?

196
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,793
       If the well is messed up,

197
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,662
             how are we going   
             to revive the Magic
             High Commission?   

198
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,898
We don't need to worry about    
that right now, Star.           

199
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,133
This sanctuary                  
is very well hidden.            

200
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,069
Now, do you want creamed corn   
or corned cream?                

201
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,071
             -What?             
         -To eat, Star.         

202
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,074
 Generations of Butterflys have 
 come here in times of danger.  

203
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,243
         We'll be safe          
    for as long as it takes.    

204
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,078
  Now, do you have any change?  

205
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,914
So we're                        
just going to hide?             

206
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,081
That's your plan B?             

207
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,883
That's a terrible plan B!       

208
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,185
          Your safety is        
          my priority right now.

209
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,889
Uh, I didn't blow up            
my whole life just              
so you could give up!           

210
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,559
Come on, we could track         
those rats back to Toffee       

211
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,160
and end this whole thing!       

212
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,262
        Even if the Magical High
        Commission was okay,    

213
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,531
     we still wouldn't be strong
     enough to defeat Toffee.   

214
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,168
          Our best bet is       
          to lay low until      
          the situation changes.

215
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,704
You lied to me.                 

216
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,573
             Star,              
      what are you doing?       

217
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,375
            What else have      
            you lied about, Mom?

218
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,277
           I bet Lekmet isn't   
           even meeting us here!

219
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,912
Lekmet is dead, Star.           

220
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,681
And it could                    
happen to us, too.              

221
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,950
Toffee won't stop               
until he finds this!            

222
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,087
            Did you take        
            that from my closet?

223
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,122
             And you're just    
             carrying it around?

224
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,625
It's too dangerous              
to do anything but stay.        

225
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:57,696
             No! I am not hiding
             here until I am old
             and gray like you! 

226
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,131
              This has          
              to mean something!

227
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,299
No, Star!                       

228
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,935
The wands are linked!           
He'll find us!                  

229
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,904
       Oh, like he won't find us

230
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,373
              with you carrying 
              his finger around!

231
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,276
            I defeated him once,
            I can do it again!  

232
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,078
            Fantastic exit beam!

233
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,479
Star, stop!                     

234
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,782
      Why? What happened        
      to cool warrior queen Mom?

235
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,118
I was never                     
a cool warrior queen, Star.     

236
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,288
I was a happy-go-lucky          
girl like you.                  

237
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,791
And then Toffee and his monsters
killed my mother.               

238
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,436
I thought you sent              
Grandma to a grandma farm       

239
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,106
to hang out                     
with other grandmas.            

240
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,008
                       Oh, Star.

241
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,185
Tell me.                        

242
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,088
            I was about your age
            when it happened.   

243
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,326
       I didn't know what to do,
       so I spoke to Eclypsa.   

244
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,461
<i>Eclypsa</i> Eclypsa?                

245
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:07,165
But she's been dead             
for hundreds of years!          

246
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,201
            No, Eclypsa's alive.

247
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,103
                And I made      
                a deal with her.

248
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,207
     [monsters chattering]      

249
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,155
                  [Mildrew] Hey.

250
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,957
             I'm sorry,         
             am I bothering you?

251
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,360
No, Count Mildrew.              
I'm just...                     

252
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,895
        Mourning                
        the loss of your mother?

253
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,363
                   I understand.

254
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,131
It's been a hard week,          
but I'm--                       

255
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,366
           There's              
           no need to be strong.

256
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,634
        Deal with your feelings.

257
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,236
                We will handle  
                everything else.

258
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:49,974
         Uh, Princess?          
    Uh, I mean, Queen Moon?     

259
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,343
  There's a... a situation...   

260
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,180
           in the...            
     in the situation room.     

261
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,215
  I swear it wasn't my orders!  

262
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,416
                      [grunting]

263
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,351
You shut up during              
your confession!                

264
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,253

      -[Young Moon] Mina.       

265
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,757
What is going on?               

266
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,058
        [chair squeaks]         

267
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,664
       What is going on?        

268
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,766
            According           
            to this dingus here,

269
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,268
              one of his mooks  
              lammed-off        
              with half an army,

270
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,238
          and they're the ones  
          who put your mama     
          in a wooden nightgown.

271
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,673
Ya know, they, uh...            

272
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,274
They put her on ice.            

273
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,110
Uh, drapes down in funtown.     

274
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,112
                Thank you, Mina.

275
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,013
Sorry about your mama.          

276
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,116
      The queen and I were      
  about to sign a peace treaty  

277
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,017
            when one            
   of my generals went rogue.   

278
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,119
Rogue wha-- Who?                

279
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,455
  He's known as... The Lizard.  

280
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,090
[stifling laugh]                
Sorry. "The Lizard"             

281
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,392
      -Dude, don't laugh.       
     -Shut it, both of you!     

282
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,762
  Put this guy in the caboose   
  and let's croak those toads!  

283
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,463
I think we should go to war!    

284
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,031
Now is not the time.            

285
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,900
      And her magic isn't strong
      enough for war yet.       

286
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,702
Especially                      
against the lizards.            

287
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:51,870
They're indestructible.         

288
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,371
We need to go to war!           

289
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,306
       We need                  
       to sign the peace treaty!

290
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,875
         Yelling feels          
     really good right now!

292
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,379
      [Young River] Maybe       
   we should let Moon decide?   

293
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,382
       She is the Queen.        

294
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,285
She just lost                   
her mother, River.              

295
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,821
 She needs time                 
 with her feelings.             

296
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,290
    [all shouting at River]     

297
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,928
I am the queen now,             
so I will make the decision.    

298
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,898
         My decision...         

299
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,200
         is that I will         
    make a decision at dawn.    

300
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,772
       Ugh. Why did I say       
   "decision" so many times?    

301
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:30,575
           Queen Moon! I'm sorry
           I spoke out of place.

302
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,110
            I got you something.

303
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,445
Uh... what is this?             

304
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,680
           It's an apology meat.

305
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,949
        It's how                
        we Johanssons apologize.

306
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,518
It was a relief to know         
someone believed in me.         

307
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,920
Thank you.

309
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,825
                Did I just call 
                the queen "pal"?

310
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,831
     Ugh! Oh, apology meat,     
     what am I going to do?

                   Oh, Glossy,  
                   are you okay?

314
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,843
No!

00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,149
And she's

                  No, she isn't.

00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,888
And I really liked her, too.

Oh, yeah...

I don't know, just pick one.

Sure it'll work out.            

331
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,372
      That's not helpful at all.

00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,507
Yeah, you're probably right.

I'm in no condition

If you'll excuse me,

00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,420
[whispering] B... 4.            

344
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,554
                           What?

345
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,424
B... 4                          

346
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,892
                       "Before"?

347
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,594
                    Before what?

348
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,029
              B...              

349
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,497
               4.               

350
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,270
             Oh, wait.          
             You want the candy?

351
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,873
        B4, B4, B4, B4!         

352
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,875
                        O...kay.

353
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,986
[straining]                     

354
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,823
              Aah!              

355
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,460
          Mmm mmm mmm!          

356
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,163
   How long have I been here?   

357
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:08,499
            Uh, like, 300 years.

358
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,636
[coughs] 300 years?             

359
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,406
[munching]                      

360
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,611
So, you're the new queen?       

361
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,647
                Yes, what of it?

362
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,617
Well, it's just                 
you're far too young            
to be queen, unless...          

363
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,585
Oh, no.                         

364
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,020
Unless, your mother,            
is she...?                      

365
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,923
                      [sniffles]

366
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,524
I see.                          

367
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:37,662
I lost my mother, too,          
when I was not                  
much older than you.            

368
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,332
       Ever since Mom...        
       um, since I became queen,

369
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,601
              everybody's       
              been looking to me
              to end the war    

370
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,370
            and make all        
            these big decisions,

371
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,838
             but I'm just a kid!

372
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,940
              I can't decide    
              the fate of Mewni!

373
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,275
             I can't even decide
             which boy I like!  

374
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,877
I know how you feel.            

375
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,179
               But that's       
               not why I'm here.

376
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:59,384
         I need you to teach me 
         one of the spells from 
         your Forbidden Chapter.

377
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,853
Forbidden? Is that what         
they're calling my chapter?     

378
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,389
               Yeah, sorry,     
               I didn't name it.

379
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,157
                But the point is
                I need a spell  

380
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,726
      that can destroy something
      that's immortal.          

381
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,230
Are you sure                    
that's what you want?           

382
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,365
              It's my only hope.

383
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,802
Well, the spell you seek        
requires a magical contract.    

384
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,737
I can give it to you,           

385
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,539
but once your enemy             
is killed,                      

386
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,475
you must give me                
something in return.            

387
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,678
         Okay, what do you want?

388
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,547
My freedom.                     

389
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,748
                           What?

390
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,550
Oh, I know                      
it's a lot to ask.              

391
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,019
But I've                        
just been here so long.         

392
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,387
All by myself.                  

393
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,089
I want to buy                   
my own chocolate.               

394
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,926
Or those little                 
shrink-wrapped muffins          
at the bottom. Mm!              

395
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,162
            But these are       
            Rhombulus' crystals.

396
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,830
               I can't free you.

397
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:49,567
A contract                      
between two queens is           
stronger than any crystal.      

398
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,437
Now, do you want                
to learn the spell?             

399
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,551
Come close. Now...              

400
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,886
[whispering]                    

401
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:13,591
And aim it directly             
at his heart.                   

402
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,393
What was that for?              

403
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,627
          I'm just doing my job,
          Your Majesty.         

404
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,262
                Evil queen,     
                gotta freeze it.

405
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,732
        She didn't seem so evil.

406
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,234
The queen is late.              

407
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,302
     Look!                      

408
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,636
        [goat bleating]         

409
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,108
                  She's gone mad
                  with grief!   

410
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,776
               She was so young!

411
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,111
                       [sobbing]

412
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,879
She's not dead yet,             
you fool!                       

413
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,678
Uh, can we help you?            

414
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,747
        I wish to speak         
        to the general.         

415
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,750
         -The general?          
          -[laughter]           

416
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:13,851
       [Toffee] Silence!        

417
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,035
                Hello, Princess.

418
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:34,038
I presume you're the one        
they call "The Lizard"?         

419
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,973
          Yes,                  
          but you may call me...

420
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,341
            Toffee.             

421
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,944
Toffee?                         
How is that any better?         

422
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,512
               What do you want?

423
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,814
I want you and your army        
to leave immediately,           

424
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,184
or face the consequences.       

425
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,287
  Your mom couldn't defeat us,  
      and neither can you!      

426
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,389
I was hoping you'd say that.    

427
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,327
      We're not afraid          
      of your little girl magic!

428
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,230
We're invincible!               
Just watch!                     

429
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,698
           No, wait!            
   I already know about the--   

430
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,699
           -[crunch]            
             -Ugh!              

431
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,535
[grunting]                      

432
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,904
           [cheering]           

433
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,476
  I call the darkness unto me.  

434
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,146
      From deepest depths       
       of earth and sea.        

435
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,917
    From ancient evils unawoken,

436
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,053
         break the one          
     that can't be broken.      

437
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,525
       To blackest night,       
        I pledge my soul        

438
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,860
       and crush my heart       
        to burning coal.        

439
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,363
        To summon forth         
        a deathly power,        

440
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,831
             to see             
     my hated foe devoured.     

441
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,366
              Aah!              

442
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,001
        Enough of this.         

443
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,148
       Have you learned nothing?

444
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,026
           [all gasp]           

445
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,961
It's not growing back!          

446
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:07,431
          [screaming]           

447
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,368
            [grunts]            

448
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,542
Queen Moon!                     
You did it!                     

449
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,810
             Oh, my gosh! River!

450
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,746
                      Thank you.

451
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:25,616
           What did you just do?

452
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,785
         I did my job!          

453
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,621
       And as your queen,       
  I will continue to do my job  

454
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,323
  of protecting this kingdom.   

455
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,959
             I will hunt down
