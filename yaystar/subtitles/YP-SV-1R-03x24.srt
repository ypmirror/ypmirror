       will be ruined.          

235
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,433
  So you can either help me     
or you can get out of my way.   

236
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,569
                 Come on, Marco.

237
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,771
         Princesses.            
          Pat, pat.             

238
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,178
          Hey, Slime.           

239
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,980
          Slimy dude.           

240
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,349
          You in here?          

241
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,627
              What do you think 
         this place was anyway? 

242
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,529
           I don't know.        

243
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,599
                   These stairs 
                   are not easy 
                 in this dress. 

244
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,135
Whoa, check it out.             

245
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,205
It's like                       
a little campsite.              

246
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,911
   These earmarks are fresh.    

247
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,214
          [both gasp]           

248
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,383
Slime?                          
If that was you,                

249
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,552
now would be                    
a nice time to tell us.         

250
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,487
       [Marco] Matches,         
      matches, matches!         

251
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,623
Okay, here.                     
I've got the candle.            

252
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,458
        - Here, here.           
     - I can't see where.       

253
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,660
       Wait, I'll just          
         use my wand.           

254
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,365
          What the...           

255
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,401
        Mina Loveberry?         

256
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,337
          Mud Sister?           

257
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,507
      What the heck are         
       you doing here?          

258
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,810
        I am throwing           
       a very important         

259
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,012
      Mewman and Monster        
      friendship party.         

260
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,980
         Wait, wait,            
          monsters?             

261
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,016
 I've been throwing monsters    
       into this closet         

262
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,919
         - all night.           
     - Get us outta here!       

263
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,555
What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.   
     What are you doing?        

264
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,390
   You need to let them go      
          right now.            

265
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,759
        I need to keep          
       this place safe          

266
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,228
      from evil monster         
          treachery.            

267
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,263
              They're not evil, 
            they're my friends. 

268
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,733
           Come on.             
   This place is abandoned.     

269
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,601
       Nothing sinister         
         is going on.           

270
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,703
  Young warrior, everything     
     about these monsters       

271
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,605
   and whoz-its is sinister.    

272
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,540
    You don't understand.       
       I am trying to--         

273
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,375
         Interrupting!          

274
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,010
     You don't understand       
       the complexities         

275
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,779
       of this situation.       

276
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,581
       I am duty-bound          
   to protect this temple.      

277
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,516
        Doctor's orders.        

278
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,685
This one's                      
all you, Mud Sister.            

279
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,554
Maybe it's time                 
to get a second opinion.        

280
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,757
     You doubt the words        
      of a professional?        

281
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,259
 No, but, just... ow!           

282
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,861
         Okay, stop it!         

283
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,596
      Okay, Mina, look,         
     let's just calm down       

284
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,598
    and not escalate things.    

285
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,434
       I'm not the one          
escalating things, escalator.   

286
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,403
      I've been waiting         
  hundreds of years... aaah!    

287
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,376
        Princess Marco.         

288
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,045
Heinous?!                       
Oh, no!                         

289
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,414
I am done                       
running from you.               

290
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,851
 This ends now...               

291
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,954
             Okay.              

292
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,158
     Now to set the mood.       
       Play the music.          

293
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,460
         Again, milady?         

294
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,828
           Play it!!            

295
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,463
                 Yes, ma'am.    

296
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,565
                   [whispering] 
             Heard it 15 times. 

297
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,035
     [thrash rock playing]      

298
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,608
              Start the machine.

299
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,911
          [muttering]           

300
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,815
  Milady, the lever is stuck.   

301
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,449
           What? Hmm?           

302
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,853
       When I push it,          
     it doesn't go down.        

303
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,254
                   You imbecile!

304
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,256
      Utterly incompetent.      

305
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,991
         But no matter.         

306
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:18,463
             This is between me 
        and Princess Marco now. 

307
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,388
                Milady.         

308
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,090
            [gasps]             

309
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,230
          It can't be.          

310
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,002
       So are we still          
       fighting or... ?         

311
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,404
 Leave the room, Marco.         

312
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,409
        What have you           
      got there, milady?        

313
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,745
             Dolls.             

314
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,982
           Oh, I...             
       I can see that.          

315
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,850
      These were my dolls.      

316
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,187
        I love my dolls.        

317
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,489
          That's...             
        that's very...          

318
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,657
                 nice.          

319
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,659
      I can't believe it.       

320
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,828
           It's all             
      coming back to me.        

321
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,197
     That was my bookshelf,     

322
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,266
       and my toy chest.        

323
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,836
         This place,            
     this was my nursery.       

324
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,038
            [gasps]             

325
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,011
         And this...            
    this was my baby bed.       

326
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,214
But how is                      
this possible?                  

327
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,349
      Oh, it's possible,        
          all right.            

328
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,385
         I knew you'd           
   be back here one day...      

329
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,353
            Meteora.            

330
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,956
    I beg your pardon!          

331
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,925
This is Miss Heinous,           

332
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,127
the honorable                   
headmistress                    

333
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,597
of St. Olga's School            
for Wayward Princesses.         

334
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,533
          No. Meteora.          

335
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,769
        That is my name.        

336
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:09,240
   At least, it was my name     
    a long, long time ago.      

337
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,977
       Milady, your arm.        

338
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,046
      No, no, no, no, no!       

339
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,815
   Shall I fetch your makeup?   

340
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,650
Well, ain't this                
a pretty picture?               

341
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,585
 First, Eclipsa wakes up,       

342
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,655
and now, look who               
comes a-cryin'. Typical.        

343
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,824
Whoa, wait. Eclipsa?            
What does she have to do        
with this?                      

344
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,793
      Yeah, can someone         
         fill us in?            

345
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,962
     Don't you ding-dongs       
        know anything?          

346
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,997
        She's her mama.         

347
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,599
          Eclipsa is            
      Heinous' mother?!         

348
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,568
             But how? Eclipsa's 
         hundreds of years old. 

349
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,971
       Besides, that would mean 
                Heinous is a... 

350
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,439
                     a princess.

351
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,175
           It means             
      she's a Butterfly.        

352
