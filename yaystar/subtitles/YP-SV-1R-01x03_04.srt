         I like red,            
       I like hoodies.          

18
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,280
         So I bought            
       a dozen of them.         

19
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,782
         JUSTIN: Hey,           
    it's that magic girl!       

20
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,283
   ( indistinct chattering )    

21
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,317
         LARRY: Hey,            
       what's up, Star?         

22
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,553
    Hi, new friends.            
    Hi!                         

23
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,321
          Everyone's            
     so cool here, Marco.       

24
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:56,321
         It makes me            
       wish my parents          

25
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,625
      had tossed me out         
   of the castle years ago.     

26
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,860
   Oh, you haven't even met     
      the coolest guys.         

27
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,695
          <i> Alfonzo and Ferguson.</i>

28
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,731
            Quick,              
       here she comes.          

29
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,232
          Hey, hey.             
       Are those books?         

30
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,267
     Where are you going        
      with those books?         

31
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,568
      Do you like to read?      

32
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,237
   Oh, dear.                    

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,672
         They're usually cooler.

34
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,275
        I need to fix           
         Ferguson up.           

35
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,609
                   No.          

36
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,646
           ( gasps )            

37
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,649
             Jackie Lynn Thomas!

38
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,284
            Hey, Star Butterfly.

39
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,718
      Hi, Jackie!               

40
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,722
I need to fix you up.           

41
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:31,723
                What?           

42
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,292
      Oh, come on.              

43
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:34,593
      I'm almost as good        
        at matchmaking          

44
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,794
as I am with magic.             

45
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,598
              I'm good.         

46
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,636
        Look, look, look, look, 
            look! It's my name. 
                  It's my name. 

47
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,805
         With a star            
    inside of a butterfly       

48
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,675
  and two hearts and a spider.  

49
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,612
     As you can see, class,     

50
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,682
       most of you have         
     done a pathetic job.       

51
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,650
                 Not me!        

52
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,420
         I got an "F"           
        for fantastic!          

53
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,789
That's an "F" for fail.         

54
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,324
              Huh?              

55
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,693
     What? You don't have       
       tests on Mewni?          

56
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,728
             Uh...              

57
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,296
        So what grade           
         did you get?           

58
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,398
     Only the best grade        
         you can get.           

59
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,868
           A-plus,              
     with a smiley face.        

60
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,305
         Ooh, I want            
      the best one, too.        

61
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,740
         Wait, don't!           

62
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,809
Oh, Miss Skullnick!             

63
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,778
          ( grunting )          

64
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,348
     Hey, Skullzie!             

65
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,351
        Can you please          
     do me a teeny favor        

66
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,353
       and turn my "F"          
         into an "A"?           

67
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,255
        You're whining          
     about a lousy grade?       

68
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,390
       I'd finally got          
      a guy with a boat,        

69
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,325
        and he left me          
         at the dock.           

70
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,793
            A dock?             

71
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,395
        The dock isn't          
     the important part.        

72
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,732
      I guess I'm doomed        
         to dry land.           

73
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,400
           I got it!            

74
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,736
     I'll cast a spell to       
   get you the perfect guy,     

75
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,804
     and you can give me        
      the perfect grade.        

76
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,339
            What?               
            Man--               

77
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,807
            Wait!               
          Left arm!             

78
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,344
           ( gasps )            

79
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,346
            Star,               
       what did you do?         

80
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,849
     I think I turned her       
        into a troll.           

81
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,352
     Star Butterfly rules!      

82
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,288
          ( cheering )          

83
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,389
         ( screaming )          

84
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,291
                I'm hideous!    

85
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,759
            Quick!              
       Change her back.         

86
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,327
         Oh, okay...            
        yeah, right...          

87
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,296
          Okay, yeah.           

88
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,430
     Lightning Change Back!     

89
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,373
     Where are we?              

90
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,808
      You just zapped us        
      back to the house!        

91
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,345
        I wish I knew           
       how I did that.          

92
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,380
     It could really come       
   in handy if I don't feel     

93
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,782
    like using my legs.         

94
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,329
     Ludo, Master.              

95
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:53,732
 Star Butterfly has come home   
   from school early today      

96
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,368
   and she seems distracted.    

97
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,504
          Distracted?           

98
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,373
           Excellent!           

99
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,775
      This is the moment        
    I've been waiting for.      

100
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:08,480
    No one's at their best      
   when they're distracted!     

101
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,818
            Finally!            

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,520
      I'll get my hands         
    on that glorious wand!      

103
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,757
     When it transforms,        
    it will match my hat.       

104
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,826
 And I'll get my big boy body.  

105
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,428
     Kick down the tower.       

106
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,330
      Zip, zap, zip, zip.       

107
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,865
      And I'm a lifeguard.      

108
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,767
       One, two, three...       

109
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,837
 Is that CPR?                   

110
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,538
            Silence!            

111
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,441
     Yes, unfortunately,        
       I was too late.          

112
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,445
      Please don't cry,         
       Miss Skullnick.          

113
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,381
        Star, we can't          
        keep stalling.          

114
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,548
      You're gonna have         
      to call your mom.         

115
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,784
       She'll know how          
    to reverse the spell.       

116
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,786
             No!                
    I can't ask for help.       

117
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,856
        If my parents           
     find out about this,       
 they're gonna send me to...    

118
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,559
 <i> Saint Olga's Reform School</i>    
   <i> for Wayward Princesses.</i>     

119
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,461
      <i> It's a terrible,</i>         
       <i> horrible place</i>          

120
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,497
  <i> and no one who goes there</i>    
  <i> ever comes out the same!</i>     

121
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,831
         ( screaming )          

122
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,802
              Is it all out yet?

123
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,903
       Almost.                  

124
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,375
       Okay, I'm done.          
     Look, Star, you just       
 need to get the information    

125
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,311
   without letting her know     
       what's going on.         

126
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,546
          You know,             
   dance around the truth.      

127
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,349
I'm a great dancer.             

128
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,488
           Mirror,              
    Mirror on the wall...       

129
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,556
                Call Mom.       

130
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,857
 <i> MIRROR: Calling Tom.</i>          

131
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,827
            Star!               
           No. No.              

132
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,495
          Oh, wait.             
   You're here. I'm here--      

133
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,564
      I said, call Mom,         
           not Tom.             

134
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,433
          No, Star.             
        Don't hang up.          

135
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,502
    I really got to delete      
      him off my mirror.        

136
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,372
      Oh, Star, darling,        
  what a pleasant surprise!     

137
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,573
                  So, Mom.      

138
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,575
     Let's just say that        
     someone accidentally       

139
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,377
        turned someone          
  into a troll with a wand.     

140
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,379
           Not that             
     I would do that, no,       

141
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,847
    because that would be       
  completely irresponsible--    

142
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,915
            ( thud )            

143
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,384
            Star,               
      what is going on?         

144
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,319
       Got to go, bye.          
        What happened?          

145
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,921
          She jumped            
       out the window.          

146
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,360
             Wow,               
       good job, Marco.         

147
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,862
          LUDO: Wow,            
       good job, Marco.         

148
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,864
      Ludo, what are you        
         doing here?            

149
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:10,302
         Catching you           
   at your most distracted!     
            What?               

150
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,437
     I have been way more       
    distracted than this.       

151
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,507
        I don't know,           
 you seem pretty distracted.    

152
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,875
        Nah, not really.        

153
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,477
      Oh, well...               

154
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,544
What's that over there?         

155
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,545
            What?               
            Where?              

156
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,646
            Get her!            

157
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,427
        Dagger Crystal          
        Heart Attack!           

158
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,962
         Feel the love.         

159
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,300
                  I'm obligated 
                   to warn you, 

160
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,503
       I'm a green belt         
        with a stripe.          

161
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,660
         Rainbow Blast!         

162
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,612
                  Narwhal Blast!

163
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,713
         Narwhal Blast!         

164
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,552
 Narwhal blast.                 

165
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,323
      Well, uh, I should        
  probably be getting back.     

166
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,693
    Kids ain't gonna fight      
    themselves, you know.       

167
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,728
      Maybe I'll see you        
       around sometime.         

168
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,335
     Hey, Marco, you can        
   handle this for a minute     

169
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,336
on your own, right?             

170
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,471
     Oh, yeah, no problem.      

171
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,406
Cool, thanks!                   

172
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,507
    Wait...                     

173
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,378
             Oh, Miss Skullnick!

174
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,480
      What?                     

175
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,647
       See that monster         
         over there?            

176
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,586
          He thinks you're cute.

177
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,454
      Really?                   

178
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,656
    Ooh, what should I do?      
       Wait right here.         

179
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,726
   Hey there, Monster Guy.      
  See that troll over there?    

180
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,698
                    Star!       

181
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,433
           Get him!             
           Get him!             

182
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,568
          Hey, guys!            
I think you forgot something.   

183
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,438
Get the wand!                   

184
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,542
        Turbo Nuclear           
       Butterfly Blast!         

185
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,446
           Not again!           

186
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,563
        Get up! Get up!         

187
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,468
           Told you             
     I wasn't distract--        

188
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,470
       Wait, did I just         
        kill that guy?          

189
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,438
       No, he's not dead.       

190
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,641
      He's probably just        
     bleeding internally        

191
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,609
      and being a total         
        baby about it.          

192
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,447
                          Open--

193
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,715
          Get up you, dipsticks.

194
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,657
       MISS SKULLNICK:          
   Ooh, you're so muscle-y.     

195
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,364
     So now that I hooked       
 you up, how about that "A"?    

196
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:26,364
       Honey, please!           

197
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:30,602
   I'd give you an "A plus"     
  if I was still a teacher.     

198
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,705
       I'm setting sail         
  with Captain Triceps here.    

199
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,376
 What about my "A"?             

200
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,678
  Try studying.                 

201
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,451
          So anyway,            
      long story short,         

202
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,386
    Skullnick ran off with      
this weird man-bull-guy thing   

203
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,421
           to another dimension.

204
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,357
           And now              
     she is gone forever!       

205
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,359
     Star Butterfly rules!      

206
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,460
          ( cheering )          

207
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,665
          Wow, Star,            
    that is so rad, girl.       

208
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,469
           Thanks,              
   but actually it's Marco      

209
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,405
         who deserves           
       all the credit.          

210
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,440
   Really?                      

211
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,708
That's awesome!                 

212
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:25,490
       Miss Skullnick?          
    He dumped me, I think.      
        I don't know.           

213
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,525
I couldn't understand           
a word he was saying.           

214
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,561
        Welcome back,           
          Skullzers.            

215
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:32,530
          Get ready             
    for the worst pop quiz      

216
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,399
     of your lives!             

217
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,500
    TOGETHER: Oh, man.          

218
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:46,645
                  Sorry, Marco. 
     I didn't mean to embarrass 
        you in front of Jackie. 

219
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:50,482
Are you kidding?                
That's the most                 
she's ever talked to me!        

220
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,353
       Then that means          
       I'm even better          

221
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,489
        at matchmaking          
    than I am with magic.       

222
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,366
      STAR: Oh, my gosh.        
 I can't wait. I can't wait.    

223
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,402
    My very first pep rally.    

224
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,604
                I am so excited.

225
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,672
         When aren't            
         you excited?           

226
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,507
                       Shh.     

227
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,509
         And now, Brittany Wong,

228
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,477
 who became head cheerleader    
          on her own            

229
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:23,348
   and not because her dad      
       made a generous          
   donation to the school.      

230
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,650
          TOGETHER:             
       Go, Echo Creek!          
  Let's try not to get beat!    

231
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,553
       Go, Echo Creek!          
  Let's try not to get beat!    

232
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,722
     Go, go, go, go, yeah!      

233
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,626
       Make some noise          
         if you love            

234
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,494
     the Awesome Opossums!      

235
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,630
                I love opossums.

236
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,433
   They carry their babies      
       on their backs.          

237
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,635
    You know she's talking      
about our football team, right? 

238
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,471
    We're going up against      
        the Warriors.           

239
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,641
          Warriors?             
          Our rivals            
    from Silver Hill Prep.      

240
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:52,577
          Every year            
their team slaughters our guys. 

241
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,513
        It's gonna be           
         a bloodbath.           

242
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,616
                That's terrible!

243
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,385
           We must do something!

244
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,487
       Well, you could          
  join the Spirit Committee.    

245
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,788
Those kids are relentless       

246
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,723
        when it comes           
   to supporting the team.      

247
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,691
           Opossums!            

248
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,428
Relentless.                     

249
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,563
              What a great idea.

250
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,598
      We better pick up         
        some supplies.          

251
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,602
    As fun as that sounds,      
    you can go without me.      

252
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:18,703
                   Okay.        

253
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,540
     Hey, Sculzy, what's        
    your favorite weapon?       

254
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,641
          Battle axe.           

255
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,445
           And now,             
       our new mascot,          

256
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,582
  that I never approved of,     
     the Awesome Opossum.       

257
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,383
           All right!           

258
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,519
      Come on, Opossum--        
             No.                

259
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,720
           Where's              
       the real possum?         

260
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,655
       Did the Warriors         
       steal it again?          

261
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,826
         Those jerks.           
    Sadly, the real possum      
    wasn't playing possum.      

262
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:49,501
       I hiss, I bite,          
  I shake my tail like that!    

263
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,503
           Hey, that's Ferguson!

264
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,706
     He's our new mascot.       
           Oh, no!              

265
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,475
   That means the Warriors      
     are gonna steal him!       

266
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,377
Oh, that's silly.               

267
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,512
        The only thing          
         that's silly           

268
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,713
     is how the Warriors        
        are gonna look          

269
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,748
        when they try           
     to steal my friend!        

270
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:17,562
   So many brave young men,     
    so many tragic losses.      

271
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,440
       Alpha Team One,          
  commencing security sweep     

272
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,608
    for the Warriors, over.     

273
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,448
 Oh, Marco.                     

274
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:43,388
  How can we prevent another    
   tragic loss to our team?     

275
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,524
Well, if I knew                 
anything about football,        
I'd use the element of surprise.

276
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,459
          Of course,            
    of course, of course.       
        Surprise them.          

277
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,428
          Bring out             
    the kitty cat outfits.      
             Yes!               

278
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,398
       Maybe even throw         
    a couple of big bombs.      
            Bombs!              

279
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,599
  Yeah, I've got to go tell     
that to the Spirit Committee.   

280
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,667
                          Bye.  

281
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:58,770
     We have an all clear.      

282
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,472
       Move! Move! Move!        

283
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,474
         This is not            
      the respect a guy         

284
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,710
 in a possum suit deserves.     

285
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,413
          <i> BRITTANY:</i>            
    <i> Don't worry, Sabrina.</i>      

286
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,747
       <i> The spirit boys</i>         
    <i> are gonna catch you.</i>       

287
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,482
      Grow some pom-poms.       

288
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,654
           What the--           

289
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,822
       Do these explode?        

290
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:21,526
    Maybe we can set them       
           on fire.             

291
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,431
        We're kind of           
 in the middle of something.    

292
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,700
      You're the leader?        
       What's the plan?         

293
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,470
          This year,            
   we have a secret weapon.     

294
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:33,605
   We're gonna distract them    

295
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,707
    with our booty-shaking      
         dance moves.           

296
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,776
         Do you know            
      nothing of combat?        

297
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,746
No Warrior's gonna be distracted
    by Chandelle's booty.       

298
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,782
            What?               
        Lucky for you,          
       my mom assigned          

299
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,552
       the Royal Guards         
      as my babysitters.        

300
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,454
           You know             
    you've done it right,       

301
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,456
 when you hear the neck snap.   

302
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,460
              Yay!              

303
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,763
            I know              
      on planet Moo-ni,         

304
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,431
         or wherever            
      it is you're from,        

305
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,567
        it may be okay          
        to be stupid,           

306
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,737
but no pesky magical foreigner  
is gonna question my leadership.

307
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,606
  You are officially banned     
  from the Spirit Committee.    

308
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,542
            Fine.               
        It looks like           
      it's all up to me.        

309
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,512
            Okay,               
    thanks for coming out.      

310
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,713
        Come back never!        

311
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,416
      Okay, if a Warrior        
     tries to kidnap you,       

312
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,619
    blow on this stranger       
       danger whistle.          
     This is ridiculous.        

313
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,756
I just wanted to dress up like  
a possum to pick up on ladies.  

314
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,492
     Hey, this whistle's        
    gonna save your life!       

315
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:28,660
    Put it in your mouth!       
            Do it!              

316
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:29,727
             No!                
           Blow it!             

317
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:30,695
            Never!              
   You get it away from me.     

318
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,763
     Let me hear you blow.      

319
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:31,763
       Get the whistle          
        away from me.           

320
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,669
     You guys ready to be       
part of my kitty cat offense?   

321
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,540
      Oh, fine.                 

322
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,743
     Then I guess we got        
   to do this the hard way.     

323
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,811
             Kitty!             

324
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,650
         I got you now!         

325
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,624
      Why can't I go home?      

326
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,726
  Dude, it's Taco Wednesday,    
          it's a day            

327
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,761
   we eat all the leftovers     
      from Taco Tuesday!        

328
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,596
      Because your house        
   would be the first place     

329
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,632
   the Warriors would look      
 when they try to kidnap you!   

330
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,767
       It kind of feels         
like you're trying to kidnap me.

331
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,536
             I'd watch that talk

332
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,504
   if you ever want to see      
     your parents again!        

333
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:13,504
          STAR: Marco!          

334
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,610
   Hey, Marco, do you have      
any highly flammable liquids?   

335
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,546
        I don't know.           
      Check the garage.         

336
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,747
            Cool.               
           Thanks.              

337
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,751
         All right--            
      Man, I bet I could        
     get a lot of action        

338
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:27,785
           if I had             
   a real prehensile tail.      

339
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,487
Oh, yeah.                       

340
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,822
         Hey, ladies,           
    you care for a drink?       

341
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,765
       Two, four, six,          
     eight, distract them       

342
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,567
     with our booty shake.      

343
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,668
            Oh, oh.             

344
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,649
       It's almost game         
    time and thanks to me,      

345
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,752
          no Warriors have even 
           gotten close to you. 

346
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,524
  Who's ready for a bloody,     
      bloody, bloodbath?        

347
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,229
       What's with that         
  crazed look in your eyes?     

348
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,530
       What do you mean?        

349
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,698
               Watch, Ferguson. 

350
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,932
        I need to talk          
  to Princess Cuckoo Pants.     

351
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,772
  FERGUSON: Stranger danger.    
       Stranger danger!         

352
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,807
         ( whistling )          

353
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,809
         Okay, Star,            
     what are you up to?        

354
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,677
     Exactly what you said.     

355
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,647
       I booby-trapped          
       the battlefield.         

356
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,882
             What?              

357
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,690
  Star, the Warriors weren't    
actually going to kill our team,

358
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,793
     they were just gonna       
    beat them in football,      

359
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,761
   which is a game!             

360
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,631
             Oh...              

361
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,891
           Oh, no.              
      Everything's going        
      according to plan.        

362
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,376
        Let me guess,           
    the kitty cat offense?      

363
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,781
 We have to do something!       

364
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,365
          All right.            
    Dude, you're awesome!       

365
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,367
 Thanks, bro.                   

366
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,702
         ( screaming )          

367
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,405
                 Marco!         

368
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,907
No, no, no. No!                 

369
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,646
    Mending Heart Hurricane!    

370
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,390
        Out of my way.          
    I'm too pretty to die.      

371
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,367
    Mending Heart Hurricane!    

372
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,451
        Nuclear Heart           
      Healing Hurricane!        

373
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,360
       Come on, fellas,         
    can't we discuss this       
        man to possum?          

374
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,367
  Hey, Marco, you were right,   

375
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,303
 they were trying to kidnap me! 

376
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,805
          Ferguson,             
      get off the field!        
            What?               

377
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,874
   I can't hear you through     
     all the explosions.        

378
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,344
       Ferguson!                

379
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,412
           No, buddy!           

380
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,780
           I'm sorry.           

381
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,281
         I failed you.          

382
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,783
    Look at me.                 

383
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,252
            Dude!               
  I was just playing possum!    

384
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,286
      Huh?                      

385
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,721
                It's what we do!

386
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,424
         You're alive!          

387
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,760
     This is why you only       
      have two friends.         

388
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,743
      I really messed up.       

389
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,279
          You mean,             
     we really messed up.       

390
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,348
      I should have been        
    watching out for you.       

391
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,384
 Let's get out of here!         

392
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,424
Hey, they just forfeited.       

393
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,559
            We win!             

394
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,861
        TOGETHER: Yeah!         

395
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,804
        Why do I have           
      this weird feeling        

396
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,439
I'm forgetting something.       

397
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,843
   ( screaming and cheering )   

398
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,411
       That was it.
