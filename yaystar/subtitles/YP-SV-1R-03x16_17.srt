    enough to get it made!      

123
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,212
     We cleaned toilets         
     on weekends for extra cash.

124
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,281
      But it was worth it       
     because you showed us      

125
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,882
    that there's another way    
            to live.            

126
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,651
           [cheering]           

127
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,052
        Hey, hey, it's time     

128
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,288
        for a group selfie      
        in front of the statue. 

129
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,823
        Oh, okay, sure.         

130
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,692
               Camera phone! Mm!

131
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,828
Are you...                      
enjoying this?                  

132
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,464
    Hey, this is the first time 
    he's ever been popular!     

133
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,065
        Don't ruin it for him.  

134
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,835
Well, he should tell the truth  
like a decent human being.      

135
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,070
Hey, Turdina, can I talk        
to you for a sec?               

136
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,905
    Sure. Uh, bye, ladies!      

137
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,908
Marco, I think you're running   
out of time to tell the truth.  

138
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,077
            Don't even listen   
            to her, Turdina!    

139
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,879
            These princesses    
            worship you!        

140
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,049
Yeah, but they worship          
someone who doesn't exist.      

141
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,219
Marco is the most organized,    
rule-abiding person I know.     

142
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,254
            Think of the party! 

143
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,390
Yeah, they spent all that money 
        for the statue.         

144
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,058
            I can't crush       
            their spirits!      

145
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,694
I'm just worried                
you might be letting            

146
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,063
this attention

147
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,998
        What? That's not it!    

148
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,900
        This is for them,       
        not for me!             

149
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,935
            Princess Turdina,   
            come on!            

150
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,904
            It's time           
            for your ceremony!  

151
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,272
        I can't believe         
        I'm saying this,        

152
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,341
        but I'm going           
     with Pony's advice.        

153
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,510
            Whoo! Good choice.

161
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,793
            Thank you,          
            Princess Gwendolyn, 

162
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,961
            for that beautiful  
            interpretive dance. 

163
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,964
      And now, the moment       
  you've all been waiting for,  

164
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:45,270
       the woman herself,       
    Princess Marco Turdina!

166
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:54,045
     I present you this honorary
     St. Olga's degree.         

167
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,146
        Wow!                    

168
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,150
       [chanting] Turdina!      

169
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,953
      Dearest princesses,       

170
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,256
        congratulations         
   on this wonderful school.    

171
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,158
       I know you see me        
          as an idol,           

172
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,762
           but today            
        you're my idols!        

173
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,565
     You embody everything      
    that Princess Turdina...    

174
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,634
   uh, um, that I stand for--   

175
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,237
   not letting anyone force you 
   to be something you're not,  

176
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,606
  living by your true colors,

      loving who you are!       

178
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,111
   I'm proud to have inspired   
        you to be brave,        

179
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,780
     even when it's scary.      

180
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,448
      And when being true       
          to yourself           

181
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,985
    might mean disappointing    
      thousands of people.

       that's why I have        
     to tell you the truth.

00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,014
        Princess Turdina        
          is a fraud,           

193
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,450
           and I have           
   the evidence to prove it.

     -It's a tape of what?      

195
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,656
    That's right,               
    I watched your video        
    and saw your dark secret!   

196
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,825
Oh, that phony confession I did?

197
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,860
Go ahead, show 'em!             
It's not real.

about Rodrigo?                  

204

    Whatever! That doesn't      
    prove anything!

Henceforth, you must reinstate

00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,726
until you agree                 
to make some changes.           

361
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,463
    I've spent my entire life   
    studying monsters.          

362
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,566
Nobody knows more               
about them than I do.           

363
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,602
I've even lived among them      

364
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,071
and observed                    
their behavior first-hand,      

365
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:12,543
and you are exactly the princess
I've been waiting for!          

366
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,479
    -Wait, what?                
    -For years I've hoped       
     to find a royal            

367
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,082
who actually gets it.           
The way we treat monsters       

368
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,818
in Mewni is,                    
well, monstrous!                

369
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,322
           -Exactly!            
-Monsters need to be respected. 

370
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,057
             -Yes!              
          -And loved!           

371
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,226
             -Yes!              
 -And their habitat preserved!  

372
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,829
            Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!  

373
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,899
Excellent. Let me take you      
out into the field              

374
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,834
and show you                    
what I've been working on.      

375
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:37,935
                    Let's go!   

376
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,271
Being a researcher              
is awesome!                     

377
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,673
These monster costumes          
are great!                      

378
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,443
            Oh! They're         
            monster camouflage. 

379
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:50,481
    Speaking of which,          
    we should probably go ahead 
    and apply our monster musk. 

380
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,083
Monster musk?                   
What's that?                    

381
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,952
          -[spritzes]           
      -Oh, that is nasty!       

382
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,687
What's in there?                

383
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,490
  My own special blend          
  of various monster secretions.

384
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,325
                [gargles]       

385
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,460
                Bleh, ugh!      

386
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,161
            Let's get going!    

387
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,698
            First we need to go 
            through the Forest  
            of Certain Death,   

388
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,534
then across the Lake            
of Endless Suffering,           

389
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,504
          over the Dam          
      of Constant Sorrow,       

390
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,108
       across the Bridge        
  of the Inevitable Hereafter,  

391
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,511
                and here we are!

392
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,613
Wow, sick treehouse, doc!       

393
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,981
                Oh, no...       
                [laughs]        

394
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,017
        It's not a treehouse.   

395
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,519
        It is                   
        my field research lab.  

396
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,187
It looks like                   
a treehouse to me.              

397
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,288
                It's not!       

398
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,723
Whatever you say, doc.          

399
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,327
        [grunting]              

400
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,661
              Oh!               

401
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,631
[grunts] Dr. Goodwill?          
Whatcha doing?                  

402
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,200
                Shh! There's    
                a herd nearby!  

403
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,702
A herd?                         
A herd of what?                 

404
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,105
                Monsters!       

405
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,208
    Whoa.                       

406
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,578
        This hill features      
        naturally occurring     
        geographic formations   

407
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,882
        that almost             
        look like buildings.    

408
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:02,486
        The monsters            
        were clever enough      
        to use them for shelter.

409
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,255
                Amazing!        

410
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,190
Wait, what?                     

411
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,693
        Ooh! Ooh! You've got    
        to get a look at this!  

412
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,562
            There's 011358,     

413
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,731
        and he has              
        his offspring with him! 

414
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,067
Oh, hey, Buffrog!               
You know him, too?              

415
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:20,771
    I have been watching 011358 
    since he was a tadpole.     

416
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,940
        I implanted a tracker   
        on his ear              

417
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,677
   and have been keeping        
   close tabs on him ever since.

418
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,713
          [whistling]           

419
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:33,517
          [scratching]          

420
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,219
Okay, I don't know              
about this, Goodwell--          

421
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,056
the spying, the costumes,       
the monster musk?               

422
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,724
Monsters are just like us.      

423
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,060
You don't need                  
all this equipment              
to get to know them.            

424
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:47,631
      Get to know them?         
      Oh, ho, sweet, naive Star!

425
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,567
             It's not so simple.

426
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,736
  When monsters and Mewmans mix,
  bad things happen,            

427
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,472
        usually to the monsters!

428
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,773
Yeah, but that--                

429
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,075
                I've devised    
                a plan!         

430
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,013
        Let me show... you...   

431
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,148
                    Tah-dah!    

432
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,282
    Ooh!                        

433
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,750
Nice cartsmanship.              

434
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,152
                Thank you!      

435
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,087
Aw, look at little tiny us      
in the treehouse!               

436
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,256
So cute!                        
And the monster village!        

437
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,457
What are you planning?          

438
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,825
        You see that wondrously 

439
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,261
        mysterious structure    
        the monsters built?     

440
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,762
Uh, you mean "dam"?             

441
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,631
        I believe it's some kind

442
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,133
        of primitive monument   

443
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,268
        that they built         
        out of instinct,        

444
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,738
       but no matter-- we simply
       remove a small piece     
       of their structure       

445
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,241
        to release              
        a gentle flow of water, 

446
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,309
            which travels       
            down the chasm,     

447
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,346
            covers the lowlands 
            around the monster  
            nesting grounds,    

448
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,015
            and creates         
            a natural island!   

449
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,151
                    Voilà!      

450
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,819
More like a prison.             

451
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,787
I mean, how are they            
supposed to get in and out?     

452
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,523
            Well, they don't!   

453
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:50,861
    It's guaranteed total       
    isolation from Mewmans!     

454
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,030
                Shall I detonate
                the dam?        

455
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,033
Listen, we can't just           
go around blowing up dams       

456
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,434
and imprisoning monsters!       

457
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,502
That's crazy!                   

458
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,803
Mewmans have been deciding      

459
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,805
what's best for monsters        
for way too long!               

460
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,175
        But I already did it!   

461
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,977
            [explosive noise]   

462
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,613
Ugh. Unbelievable.              

463
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,716
You know what, Jelly?           
You doomed these monsters!      

464
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,553
            You don't like      
            my explosion?       

465
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,888
It's not about that.            
I thought you were different.   

466
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,224
But you're just like            
everybody else here.            

467
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,861
No, no, no, no, no.             
Stop complaining.               

468
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,897
Look, of course there is        
bigger, better stroller.        

469
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:31,168
But you should appreciate       
the one we have.                

470
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,071
[panting] Hey, Buffrog!         

471
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,840
Look, look, look!               
Jelly Goodwell blew the dam,    

472
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,709
and now the water's             
gonna come down                 

473
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,711
and turn this whole place       
into an island!                 

474
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,746
        What?                   

475
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,650
           Hey, Star,           
      it's not a problem.       

476
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,719
          That's just           
   a little trickle of water,   

477
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,921
            nothing we haven't  
            seen before.        

478
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,892
Oh, you must be crazy dirty lady
that watches us through trees.  

479
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,061
            Hello. I am         
            Yvgeny Bulgolubuff. 

480
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:00,497
Well, I'm Jelly Goodwell!       
Oh-ho-ho!

482
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:08,706
Oh, I'm such                    
a turd-brain!                   

483
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:12,876
I shook your hand               
with the blower-upper thing!    

484
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,912
        No! It's too much water!

485
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,947
    It won't create an island.  

486
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,016
        This will destroy       
        entire village!         

487
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,117
                        Come on.

488
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,690
    Incoming!                   

489
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,758
                Oh, my goodness!

490
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,959
Come on, move it!               

491
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,194
This is not drill.              

492
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,929
        Hey, hey!               

493
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:32,963
    Hah!

       [video game tones]       

495
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,605
                    Hey, Star!  

496
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,940
            Incredible!         

497
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,777
        Mewmans and monsters    
        working together!       

498
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,980
        -Here it comes!         
            -Oh, no!            

499
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,548
             -Hey!              
             -Huh?              

500
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,717
         -Grab a rock!          
              -Oh!              

501
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,818
Great, let's go!                

502
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,320
            Oh! Okay!           

503
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,263
           [all] Yay!           

504
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,267
     How could I have been      
       such a dumb-dumb?        

505
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,837
Here I thought                  
we should live separately!      

506
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,409
But really Mewmans              
should live like monsters!      

507
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,977
Hah-hah!                        

508
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,415
Play in the mud!                
Act like idiots! Oh!            

509
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,450
I'm a monster, ho-whah!         

510
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,820
         I'm a monster!

512
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,661
                    There!      

513
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,831
        Now Mewni has           
        a real monster expert.  

514
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,266
Thank you.                      

515
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,635
            Aw, you're crying.  

516
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,603
Oh, the badge.                  

517
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,840
I think you broke               
the skin a little.              

518
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,842
            Oh, gosh!           
            Sorry, sorry, sorry.
