          it can't be dangerous.

      sound like on Mewni.      

123
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,555
   Argh! Just get down here.    

124
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,927
              Star, allow me    
              to introduce...   

125
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,529
              <i> la resistance!</i>   

126
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,265
     MARCO: The easiest way     
     to depose a ruler          

127
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,934
        is to destroy           
        his credibility.        

128
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,704
      So this virtual pet       
      will represent Ludo.      

129
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,306
      And this $650 is us.      

130
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,675
      And this feather          
      is Bird and Spider.       

131
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,478
    Normally, they're always    
    with him or nearby,         

132
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,816
    except...Bird and Spider    
    break to feed               
    every five hours.           

133
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,819
     When he's alone,           
     we take this air duct      
     to the throne room.        

134
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,887
    And that's when Foolduke    
    hits him with...            

135
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,723
                 Rubber chicken!
             No.                

136
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,724
                  ( squeaks )   

137
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,892
      How about whoopee cushion?

138
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,061
       No, we talked            
       about this before.       

139
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,563
           Ruberiot?            

140
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,699
    I have a ripping parody song
    I've been working on.       

141
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,802
He is great at ruining          
people's lives with songs.      

142
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,739
Marco, it seems like you guys   
are just kinda playing pranks.  

143
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:17,809
    Yeah, we're still workin' on
    that payoff part.           

144
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,378
   Okay, look,                  
   what you're doing here is,   

145
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,879
like, totally super-admirable,  

146
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,714
and Marco, you've never         
looked cuter in that beret,     

147
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,349
  but Ludo                      
  is not the problem here.      

148
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,917
 Toffee is controlling him.     

149
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,886
And I don't think a song        
is gonna fix things--           

150
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,988
   Star, I was thinking ab--    

151
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,891
            Guards!             

152
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,060
       ( rats squealing )       

153
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,097
You'll never silence            
the resistance!                 

154
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,499
     You! You're coming with me!

155
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,500
                     Levitato.  

156
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,501
      Aaaah!                    

157
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,902
   What the heck?               

158
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,936
     ( gasping )                

159
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,339
     ( panting, coughing )      

160
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,341
            STAR: Oh, of course.

161
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,578
All right, Ludo.                
What are you gonna do now?      

162
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,547
   Levitato me again?           

163
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,749
   Oh, I'm so scared.           
   That was the worst.          

164
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,953
Actually, you said              
something earlier about my, um--

165
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,455
              about my--        

166
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,556
          ( clears throat )     

167
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,125
          --about my W-O-N-D.   

168
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,094
Oh, so now you want my help?    

169
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,029
          Of course I want help!

170
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,632
              I've been talking 
              to my own hand!   

171
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,734
       It keeps me up all night!

172
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,936
             I can't sleep,     
             I can't think,     

173
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,873
     I can't focus on my new job
     as Mewni's beloved monarch!

174
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,974
                      Wha--?    

175
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,976
                 Oh, hello.     
                 Yes, of course.

176
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,645
               I-- No-- What?   

177
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,380
          Of course I'm beloved!

178
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,981
       Didn't you hear the song?

179
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,951
Ludo! Why do you think          
I came here without a wand?     

180
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,320
          Because...            
          you were surrendering?

181
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,956
It's corrupted! By Toffee!      

182
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,759
He's in the wands, Ludo!        

183
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:44,729
                  In the wa--   
                  In the wands?!
                  Get him out!  

184
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,998
   I don't want to be corrupted!
   I don't want to be corrupted!

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,734
   How did he even get in there?
   How did he even get in there?

186
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,770
I don't know                    
how he got in there.            

187
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,239
The last time I saw him, he--   

188
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,075
      Ooooooh.                  

189
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,410
               ( Ludo groans )  
               Yuck!            

190
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,145
Ludo, please.                   

191
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,014
I think I know                  
how to get Toffee out.          

192
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:07,919
     And then I can go back     
     to being a beloved monarch?

193
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:11,556
  Uh...yeah. ( laughs )         

194
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,731
   ( whispering )               

195
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,804
        ALL (CHANTING):         
     We are the resistance!     

196
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,839
      We remain insistent!      

197
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,441
      We're the resistance!     

198
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,043
    You can't silence           
    the resistance!             

199
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,145
  And gimme back my beret.      

200
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,147
     ( chanting continues )     
                 ( squeaking )  

201
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,449
   Wait, why are you--          

202
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,717
      Actually,                 

203
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,519
              the resistance    
              can be quieter.   

204
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,521
Be brave, Marco.                
                 ( chanting )   

205
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,124
You may fall,                   
but the resistance lives on!    

206
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,626
             What?!             

207
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,895
          Why just me?          

208
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,564
               ( blows landing )

209
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,232
              Karate boy.       

210
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,867
         ( squeaking )          

211
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,068
    Buffrog!                    

212
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,670
           And...               

213
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,071
               Marco!           

214
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,907
  Queen Moon?                   

215
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,909
               Where's Star?    
 Ludo took her.                 

216
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,911
We have to find him             
before he does something awful. 

217
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,980
                 What about     
                 arts and crafts
                 friends?       

218
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,083
     The resistance             
     will live on without me.   

219
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,418
      ALL: What?                

220
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,758
                 ( grunting )   

221
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
                       Star!    

222
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,097
          Hey, Mommy.           

223
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,299
          Hi, Marco.            

224
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,370
            I, uh...            

225
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,172
      I'm sorry, you guys.      

226
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,274
                   ( whinnies ) 

227
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,877
  The-- The Whispering Spell.   

228
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,179
           No! Star! You get--  
           You get away!        

229
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,747
        You run away from there!

230
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,683
      It's too late, Mom.       

231
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,285
               So does this mean
               that everything's
               back to normal?  

232
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,687
  It's not over yet.            

233
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,288
            What do you mean    
            it's not--          

234
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,234
                       No!      

235
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,637
          MARCO: Star!          
                     Oh, no.    

236
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,139
     Buffrog, we have to go now!

237
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,207
           ( grunts )           

238
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,543
           ( shouts )           

239
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,184
   Ludo! Where's Star?          

240
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,319
             ( gasping )        

241
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,321
              Where am I?       

242
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,924
    Where is my daughter?       
               Mom! Mom, Mom!   

243
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,258
               STAR'S VOICE:    
               I'm in here!     

244
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,294
   Star? Is that you?           

245
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,929
               Yes, it's me!    

246
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,731
  Oh, thank goodness! Oh!       

247
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,899
              Mom, stop it.     

248
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,167
          ( kissing )           

249
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,136
      Oh, Star!                 
      Where<i> are</i> you?            

250
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,906
         Well, I'm totally fine,
         bu-but, ah,            

251
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:45,310
              I don't exactly   
              know where I am.  

252
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,578
   That's okay, sweetie.        

253
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,480
   The important thing is,      
   you're safe.                 

254
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,348
     Just stay right there.     

255
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,985
And no matter wh--we'll         
find you--( voice breaking up ) 

256
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,288
  Mom? Mom, can you repeat that?

257
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,990
            ( indistinct )      
    Star?                       

258
00:10:58,992 --> 00:10:59,991
  Are you still there?          

259
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,292
             Mommy?             

260
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,994
    Oh, what is happening?!     

261
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,496
              Mom!              

262
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,269
           ( gasps )            

263
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,905
   Ohh, crazy eye, crazy eye,   
   crazy eye!                   

264
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,777
     ( whimpering )             

265
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,885
        Hello, Princess.        

266
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,057
         Toffee?! Aha!          

267
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:36,161
   I knew it! I knew it was you 
   all along!                   

268
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,130
     Wha-- Wait.                
     Is all this goop you?      

269

     Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew.      

270
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,970
You don't even recognize        
your own magic                  

271
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,206
     when you're swimming in it.

272
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,208
This stuff is the magic?        

273
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,378
        TOFFEE: It was.         

274
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,613
              Until I got here. 

275
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,050
Oh, boy, that's not good.       

276
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,685
 Mom! We've got a problem!      

277
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,254
              TOFFEE: Only I can
              speak to her now. 

278
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,026
        TOFFEE'S VOICE:         
          Hello, Moon.          

279
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,728
          Toffee.               
( Marco gasps )                 

280
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,264
       Give us back Star.       

281
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,866
              Oh, of course.    

282
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,702
       But I'd like             
       something from you first.

283
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,972
   Something that belongs to me.

284
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,713
        Take it.                

285
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,248
               No, Mom, stop!   

286
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,451
           I can take him!      
           Just hold on! Please!

287
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,420

290
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,027
TOFFEE:                         
Poor little Butterfly.          

291
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,430
         You've lost your wings.

292
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,766
          Now, Your Majesty...  

293
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,300
       do we have a deal?       

294
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,283
           Good-bye.            

295
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,387
            No--No!             

296
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,510
                      Yeech.    

297
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,782
      Where's my daughter?      

298
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:38,983
Where's Star?                   

299
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,425
          She's gone.           

300
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,928
          ( gasping )           

301
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,334
      ( crackling sound )       

302
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,504
        ( Moon panting )        

303
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,706
( Moon roars )                  
                   Oh.          

304
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,779
( straining, grunting )         

305
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,616
I call the darkness onto me     

306
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,218
   from deepest depths          
   of earth and sea.            

307
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,619
From ancient evils unawoken     

308
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,221
    break the one               
    who can't be broken;        

309
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,522
    From blackest night         
    I pledge my soul            

310
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,290
  and crush my heart            
  to burning coal.              

311
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,625
   To summon forth              
   the deadly power             

312
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,627
to see my hated foe devoured!   

313
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,100
           ( crying )           

314
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,036
            Are you finished?   

315
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,449
           ( groans )           

316
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,427
 Please...just tell me.         

317
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,832
 Did I have                     
 any part to play in this?      

318
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,834
              No.               

319
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,109
           ( gasps )            

320
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,281
          ( gasping )           

321
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,515
              Oh!               

322
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:28,426
     Hmm. Come on. Come on.     

323
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,631
      What are you doing?       

324
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,871
        ( Star panting )        

325
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,480
        ( deep breath )         

326
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,658
       ( muffled scream )       

327
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,900
 BUFFROG: Karate boy. Wake up.  

328
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:12,570
     I think the Queen, uh,     
     needs...help.              

329
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,974
         MOON: Come on, come on.
         Why won't you fit?     

330
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,909
            Come on.            

331
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,577
    Queen?                      

332
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,948
   But maybe if I-I put the wand
   back together, it'll--       

333
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,684
    it'll--it'll bring her back.

334
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,987
   But this piece won't fit.    

335
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,522
   MARCO: Here.                 

336
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,924
         Try this one.

00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,694
       GLOSSARYCK: Hey, Star!   

338
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,732
       Does this need, uh, salt?

339
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,502
             Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

           More salt? More salt?

342
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,374
     Bleeech!                   

343
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,775
                 More salt.     

344

What is wrong with him?!        

345
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,512
 What's going on here?          
 Where am I?                    

346
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,047
              I have no idea.   

347
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,682
 No one's ever been here before.

348
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,719
 Oh, no. I'm dead. I'm dead.    
 I died!                        

349
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,188
           ( sighs )            
           Well, if you're dead,
           then I'm dead.       

350
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,857
  And if you're calling me dead,
  I find it--                   

351
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,059
    well, I find it             
    a little insulting, frankly.

352
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,527
       Oh, no.                  

353
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,195
   I am totally dead.           

354
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,798
   And I'm stuck here.          
   With you.                    

355
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,199
               Uh-huh? Again.   

356
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,634
           A little insulting.  

357
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,737
      You betrayed me!          

358
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,707
   I'm sorry it seemed that way.
   Can we get beyond this?      

359
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,376
          And just enjoy

I'm gonna stay here with you,

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,350
