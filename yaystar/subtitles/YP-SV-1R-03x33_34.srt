          Oh, no.               
          You changed your look.

158
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,569

159
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,038
          and I think           
     I look great with it.      

160

    I found you when you were   
       just a street baby.      

167
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,063
      I raised you as my own

 been wandering so much lately, 

175
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,692

                  with this job.

00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,272
           I'm addicted to work.

                     I gotta go.

241
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,759
 But promise me this one thing:

  and we're both still single,  
     you'll be my soulmate.

    That's not gonna happen.

          that's gonna steal you
          away from me.         

247
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,111
Looks like it's just

   In sickness and in health.   

256
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,082
     Till death do we part.     

257
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,249
    Through pirate attacks,     

258
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,218
monster raids, and corn famine. 

259
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,220
             I do.

         [lively music]         

263
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,598
Isn't this                      
just beautiful?                 

264
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,167
It's too bad                    
Ponyhead never showed up.       

265
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,836
      Yeah, the photo booth is--

          Photo booth.          

267
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,842
      Okay. Well, I'm just gonna
      go get some pie, then.    

268
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,376
                 No way! [gasps]

269
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,579
      Wait, Marco, Marco, Marco!
      You can't leave yet.      

270
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,280
         We gotta take pictures!

271
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,449
  But I gotta take Nachos home  
         and feed her.          

272
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,951
       -Kelly can do it.        
       Let's go!                
       -No, wait!               

273
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,452
  Do not take her for a ride!   

274
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,621
     You got that, Kelly?!      
          Kelly! Aah!           

275
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,857

                 Wow...         

277
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,396
                The memories    
                in this place.  

278
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,898
Star, can I go?                 

279

             [grunting, panting]

281
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,439
      Look! Old photos from our 
      days at the bounce lounge.

282
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,808
    Can we just take photos     
        some other time?        

283
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,278
Sure, as soon as                
we take some photos.            

284
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,314
                    [groans]    

285
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,116
             -What?             
            -Money.

               Excuse me?       

287
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,053
  What? Money--                 
  give me, give me.             

288
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,922
Now, come on!                   
Where is it?                    

289
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,957
                  Star, I'm not 
                  made of money.

290
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,392
    Yes, you are.               

291
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,828
    Oh! Found it.               

292
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,464
Ohh!                            

293
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,066
Six hundred fifty dollars!      

294
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,136
See, Marco?                     
You're a boy made of money.     

295
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,005
          Yeah, yeah,           
     that should be enough.     

296
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,807
        [Star hums tune]        

297
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,308
                  First let's do
                  a silly one.  

298
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,510
                 Wah! [chuckles]

299
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,945
              Ooh! Okay, now    
              a fighting stance.

300
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,013
              Hi-yah!           

301
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,681
                Ooh! Okay,      
                now let's do one

302
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,349
       where we're stuck        
       inside a monster's belly,

303
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,351
      and we're slowly drowning 
      in its toxic stomach acid.

304
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:11,689
        [inhales sharply] Blech!

305
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,524
                 Okay, I go now.

306
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,327
Wait! [grunts]                  
One more!                       

307

               Best friend pose.

308
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,499
            Oh, boy, oh, boy,   
            oh, boy, here we go!

309
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,466
         What the--             

310
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,102
Marco, what is this?            

311
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,504
          They look like photos.

312
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,105
These aren't photos.            

313
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,507
They're travesties.             

314
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,608
               Gee, Star.       

315
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,343
I asked for                     
best friend photos,             

316
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,679
but these are business          
acquaintance photos.            

317
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,547
           So...                

318
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,349
              Okay, let me look 
              at the old photos.

319
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,550
            What do we got here?

320
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,485
      Happy-go-lucky, fish face,

321
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,888
         "Oops, I did it again,"
         too cool for school.   

322
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,757
              Okay, let's do it.

323
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,333
   Ooh! [sighs]                 

324
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,703
          Perfect! Well, see ya!

325
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,739
               You know you have
               my ankle, right? 

326
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,008
Something's... [sighs]          

327
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,510
Something's not right.          

328
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,745
                    What?       

329
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,582
These are                       
exactly the same.               

330
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,984
     I don't know what you want.

331
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,987
I want your face to             
look like this face.            

332
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,755
    I was just making that face!

333
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,191
Yours was a fake face.          

334
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,860
This is a best friend face.     

335
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,730
          I know the difference.

336
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,398
            Nope, that's not it.

337
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,368
             Something's off.   

338
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,572
   These are all travesties!    

339
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,207
      Enough shenanigans.       

340
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,709
     It's time to get real.     

341
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,312
        Too big to fail.        

342
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,418
        Come on, Marco!         

343
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,853
Star, I'm trying.

00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,554
          I know you are, Marco.

345
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,123

                    good enough!

you live in her photobooth?

          -It's magic!          
            -Oh, no.            

397
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,682
      This booth can look

         take a while.          

413
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,587

          I'm-- I'm just worried
          about Nachos.

     but I didn't want to end up

420

our adventures,

liked them, too.

And we only got                 
one money left.                 

426
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,781
            What? Where'd it go?

427
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,449
Photobooths are expensive.      

428
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,650
Plus, I gave a tip to Ben.      

429

    different in this photo?

              off-guard by it,

    I never brought it up again,
