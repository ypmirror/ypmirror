                Star, let's go. 
     We've been here for hours. 

20
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:54,853
 No. We are not leaving until   
the old donuts get thrown out.  

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,455
         ( whistling )          

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,901
      - Evening, Marco.         
       - Evening, Pete.         

23
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,836
              Ah!               

24
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,838
  Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.   

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,773
                Star. Some lady 
          just got your donuts. 

26
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,608
     What?                      

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,444
         ( shuddering )         

28
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,786
             Mina.              

29
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,856
 You're Mina Loveberry.         

30
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,758
                 You caught me. 
                 Are you a cop? 

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,893
        That's Mina Loveberry.  

32
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,595
I have no idea                  
who that is.                    

33
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,964
         Marco, she's           
     the greatest warrior       

34
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,401
       - to ever live.          
          - Uh, her?            

35
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,770
                 I lost my bag. 
                Has anyone seen 
                        my bag? 

36
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,705
That's a lady who's             
lost her marbles.               

37
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,241
          No, she's             
       Mina Loveberry.          

38
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,377
           - Hello.             
      - Mewni's greatest        
          protector.            

39
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,913
              At least, I think 
                    that's her. 

40
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,782
Well, why don't you             
see for yourself?               

41
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,917
         No, no, no.            
          Marco, no!            

42
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,753
        - Hello, Mina.          
           - Hello.             

43
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,222
      What are you doing        
          on Earth?             

44
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:07,493
       I'm on vacation.         
       Doctor's orders.         

45
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,760
What are you gonna do           
on your vacation?               

46
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,497
     I will let the soul        
         be my guide            

47
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,732
        and wander off          
        to the depths           

48
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,467
     of this unseen planet.     

49
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,269
                   Wow!         

50
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,071
That's what you say             
when you've lost your marbles.  

51
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:21,473
                  Marco, just...

52
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,675
      There is actually         
     a really great park        
      across the street.        

53
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,644
           Fantastic!           

54
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,679
      The perfect place         
       to view humanity         

55
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,748
      at its most docile.       

56
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,750
                   I will leave 
                in two seconds. 

57
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,456
     Boy, what a weirdo.        
            Star?               

58
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,258
            Oh, no.             

59
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,026
Wait. Wait, Mina.               
Wait.                           

60
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,862
Teach me your way,              
O great warrior.                

61
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,832
        Hmm. Yeah. Okay.        

62
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,667
 Really?                        

63
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,669
O great Mina,                   
you will not be disappointed.   

64
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,671
      But ain't nothin'         
          for free.             

65
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,606
   You're gonna have to do      
      something for me.         

66
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,375
    Anything.                   

67
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,976
         Get this bag           
         off my head.           

68
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,379
                       Ooh, ow. 
                 A, E, I, O, U! 

69
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,683
  Welcome to the Echo Creek     
          Mud Pits.             

70
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,886
           Here, we will answer 
          all of your questions 
                     about mud. 

71
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,388
            Finally.            

72
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,858
         Today, I go            
       where Mina goes.         

73
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,459
Look at us; we're already       
basically best friends.         

74
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,528
          Inseparable.          

75
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,899
Boy, are you guys in for        
a real educational treat today. 

76
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,467
      Lesson number first.      

77
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,736
         In becoming            
       a great warrior,         

78
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,672
       one must cleanse         
          their mind            

79
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:27,806
     from sinking thought.      

80
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:31,977
    So... just don't think?     

81
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,879
     Don't think.               

82
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,314
     Oh, it feels so good.      

83
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,916
                    Oh!         

84
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,753
We are mud sisters.             

85
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,322
         Wait a second.         

86
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,057
      Where's my camera,        
    where's my telescope,       

87
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,725
    where's my sketch pad?      
    What the heck is that?      

88
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,427
   Observe the wooly mammoth,   

89
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,729
   who may or may not have      
walked through these mud pits   

90
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,931
     19 million years ago.      

91
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,499
     We're not really sure.     

92
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,868
     Ride, my great beast.      

93
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,372
    Ride to the cloud city      
       of Cloudlandia!          

94
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,574
   Get down, ya weirdo.         

95
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,776
Come on, big boy.               
Let's get to movin'.            

96
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,679
     Uh, ma'am, you leave       
     that mammoth alone.        

97
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:11,383
I command ye to move.           

98
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,418
   That's it. I'm comin' in     
      to get you, ma'am.        

99
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,420
       Sorry, you can't         
        be doin' that.          

100
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,555
       Whoa, goin' down.        

101
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,724
What a cruel                    
twist of fate.                  

102
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,792
         Star, she's            
       clearly lost it.         

103
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,562
I am the conqueror              
of the beast.                   

104
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,130
 No autographs.                 

105
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,732
   Lesson number one, Marco.    

106
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,934
      Just stop thinkin'.       

107
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,970
         Now, class,            
         meaning you,           

108
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,940
    our next lesson is of       
      utmost importance         

109
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,976
       to the survival          
        of a warrior.           

110
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,746
   We're gonna learn how to     
      make some weapons.        

111
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:46,318
The higher I go,                
the closer I get                
to reaching the stars.          

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,620
     Be resourceful with        
      finding material.         

113
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,422
 ( girl screams )               

114
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,090
       See? Now I have          
        a sturdy chain          

115
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,625
      to chain stuff with.      

116
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,327
    Easy breezy taco peasy.     

117
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,995
       Go make your own         
       warrior weapon.          

118
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,398
       All right, Star,         
        you got this.           

119
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,500
        It's just like          
       arts and crafts,         

120
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,001
       but with weapons.        

121
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,836
           Which ones are yours?

122
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,071
( sighs )                       
Those two.                      

123
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,439
         ( screaming )          

124
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,807
            Oh, bless your soul.

125
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,611
        Come on, Star,          
  anything can be a weapon.     

126
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,413
        Oh, my goodness.        

127
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,814
      Look at this string.      

128
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,683
     How lucky could I be?      

129
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,017
       And what is this?        

130
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,019
          A pine cone?          

131
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,988
  Everything's comin' up Star.  

132
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,090
Let go of my bat,               
you naughty lady.               

133
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,859
Mina, did you finish            
building your weapon yet?       

134
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,697
        I have created          
  the most deadly of maces.     

135
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,999
        Awesome!                

136
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,034
You know, I'm actually          
pretty proud of mine, too.      

137
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,370
      Uh, kazza kazza wha?      

138
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,173
      It is a pine cone         
      tied to a string,         

139
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,309
 and then, I put some flowers   
    on it and drew a face.      

140
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,211
       I call him Davey.        

141
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,613
                     Fantastic! 
                            Ho! 

142
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,382
              Ho!               

143
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,719
                 When they turn 
                18, they're the 
          government's problem. 

144
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,455
                Hot dogs here.  

145
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,490
              Get your hot dogs.

146
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,991
                       Hot dogs.

147
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,026
      Lesson number <i> tres.</i>      

148
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,295
    You gotta gather intel.     

149
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,896
 Sh, someone may be listening.  

150
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,965
          Learn from            
    your new surroundings.      

151
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,134
        Learn from new          
        surroundings.           

152
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:12,003
Oh, sorry.                      
I didn't know                   
it was a wig.                   

153
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,072
Who is your ruler               
on this planet?                 

154
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,241
    Not from around here,       
           are we?              

155
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,977
     - She's a foreigner.       
      - Oh, how exotic.         

156
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,247
  This is the United States     
         of America.            

157
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,183
We don't have any rulers here.  
         We're free.            

158
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,687
        But who makes the rules?

159
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,389
           We make our own rules

160
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:34,326
     through the radical        
      process of voting.        

161
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,362
                 ( screeching ) 
            Just trying to wrap 
           my head around this. 

162
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,898
       You mean you vote if you 
       can do something or not? 

163
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,768
        That's right,           
         little lady.           

164
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,538
     - So I can do this?        
           - Sure.              

165
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,673
       - And this, too?         
        - You betcha.           

166
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,108
         Is this legal?         

167
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,910
                      Actually, 
                  that's arson. 

168
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,045
            Freedom!            

169
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,281
         ALL: Freedom!          

170
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,050
                MINA: No chains 
                or limitations. 
                   I'm freedom! 

171
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,386
  We have learned there are     
   no rules on this planet.     

172
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,022
          It's an anything goes 
            fight to the death. 

173
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,590
      Star, wait.               

174
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,025
    You've gotta stop this.     

175
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,560
          Stop what?            
       What am I doing?         

176
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,630
       You guys ruined          
    the entire park today.      

177
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,933
   Marco, Mina was my idol      
         growing up.            

178
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,069
   Imagine if you randomly      
    met your idol one day,      

179
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:21,206
         - and didn't           
     follow them around.        
 - But your idol is bananas.    

180
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,142
   Look, thanks for trying      
     to look out for me.        

181
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,978
    But I'm gonna go train      
        with my hero.           

182
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,048
    - Fine. I'm just gonna      
  enjoy the park by myself.     
         - ( siren )            

183
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,052
   Sir, we're gonna have to     
 ask you a couple questions.    

184
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,221
      All right, step one.      

185
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,790
      Just stop thinking.       

186
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,060
          Step two,             
        make a weapon.          

187
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:45,430
         Step <i> tres,</i>            
        gather intel.           

188
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,232
    ( panting )                 

189
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,401
        Mina, I made it!        

190
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,570
          Come, little mud face.

191
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,639
            You must partake in 
          the warrior's ritual. 

192
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,375
         Step inside            
    the circle of animals.      

193
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,248
  - Now, repeat these words:    
    - Repeat these words.       

194
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,484
      - Not these words,        
       the ones coming.         
       - Right. Sorry.          

195
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,119
     O great battle lords.      

196
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,688
  O great battle lords.         

197
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,791
     - Please protect us.       
     - Please protect us.       

198
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,293
    Carry our foes off to       
 the depths of space and time   

199
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,263
 so they may forever live in    
  the ruins of our victory.     

200
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,031
  ( muttering gibberish )...    
           victory.             

201
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,867
     Lead us to the battle,     

202
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,803
    and you shall bathe in      
      our conquests. Ha!        

203
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,639
      ( making weird noises )   

204
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,841
        So, mud sister,         

205
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,843
     what are we battling?      

206
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,812
    Some demons? Gargoyles?     

207
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,814
        - Them people.          
          - Joggers?            

208
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,282
                  No, ding-dong.

209
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:41,119
        All the people          
   of this forsaken planet.     

210
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,222
          ( laughs )            
   No. You don't mean that.     

211
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,057
 That's wacky talk.             

212
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,661
What these little ants          
lack is a ruler.                

213
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,365
                And guess who's 
            gonna give 'em one? 
                          Bink. 

214
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:58,303
     - Now, kneel before        
       your new ruler.          
           - Okay.              

215
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,239
               We're gonna have 
             so much fun rulin' 
                   these folks. 

216
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,841
I've made a huge mistake.       

217
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:06,378
  So a gonzo donut collector    
   came out of a dumpster.      

218
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,547
          - Uh-huh.             
   - To teach your friend,      

219
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,182
another gonzo donut collector   
        in a dumpster.          

220
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,684
            - Yep.              
       - And together,          

221
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,986
        they destroyed          
        a family park?          

222
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,555
Yeah. If I was trying           
to cover my butt,               

223
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,089
I'd say the exact               
same thing.                     

224
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,358
      MINA: Kneel before        
         me, minions.           

225
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,260
   I am the greatest warrior    

226
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,363
       that this world          
       has ever known!          

227
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,166
       ( siren wailing )        

228
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,101
          Let's ride.           

229
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,270
        Mina, I can't           
     take over the Earth.       

230
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,173
    Aw, of course you can.      
    You're a warrior now.       

231
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,276
             Now let's start by 
           rounding up the rest 
                of these folks, 

232
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,278
            and pushin' 'em off 
               this here ledge. 

233
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,746
       ( nervous giggle )       

234
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,015
Mina, I care about Earth.       

235
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,350
I don't wanna conquer it.       

236
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:48,520
  I thought you cared about     
       being a warrior.         

237
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,093
      I guess I thought         
       being a warrior          

238
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,227
    was something different.    

239
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,263
            Uh, excuse me, miss.

240
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,299
        - Don't we get          
       a vote in this?          
         - ALL: Yeah!           

241
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,068
                  What are you, 
          a bunch of comedians? 

242
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,570
       We ain't votin' on this. 
            I'm your ruler now. 

243
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,640
         Mm, all those in favor 
              of the crazy lady 

244
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,809
           being our new ruler, 
              raise your hands. 

245
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,647
         One, two...            
          six. okay.            

246
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,115
            All those opposed.  

247
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,286
         One, two...            
          five, six.            

248
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,988
      Looks like we have        
      ourselves a draw.         

249
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,956
               Hey, did anybody 
                      not vote? 

250
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,925
    Me.                         

251
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,293
 I didn't vote.                 

252
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,894
           Come on.             
  You got mud on your face.     

253
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,329
         We're a team.          

254
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,964
         We can rule            
     this land together.        

255
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,333
          Mud sister.           

256
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,106
   No. You're bananas, Mina.    

257
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,507
       Like the bad kind.       

258
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,508
        Hey, freedom wins again.

259
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,111
 ( cheering )                   

260
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,146
             I thought you were 
                     a warrior. 

261
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,182
      You're just a little girl 
             living on a stupid 
                freedom planet. 

262
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,119
       - You don't even         
        deserve this.           
           - Davey!             

263
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:58,323
  I wouldn't dare rule over     
       this looney bin.         

264
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,125
     - ( siren blaring )        
    - Attention, citizens.      

265
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,360
    - We are looking for--      
      - She's in there.         

266
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,197
Uh, there's                     
nothing inside.                 

267
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,999
       Magic does exist.        

268
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,236
      I repeat, magic...        
         does exist.            

269
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,205
          You were right, Marco.

270
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,841
       Mina was a lady          
       with no marbles.         

271
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,376
You wanna go check              
behind the French bakery        

272
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,278
for some day-old                
baguettes?                      

273
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,980
Of course I do.                 

274
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,848
             Boop.              

275
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,418
          Mud sister.           

276
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,029
          - Camping!            
        - ( screams )           

277
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,131
What's up, nature?!             

278
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,400
    You're gonna get tamed!     

279
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,370
                   ( buzzing )  

280
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,506
          ( gasps )             
    Nature's touching me.       

281
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,909
        Hey, little guy.        

282
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,310
           ( gasps )            

283
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,979
 Cataclysmic total extinction   
         death blast!           

284
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,515
       Star, we're not on Mewni.

285
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,551
          ( buzzing )           

286
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,386
            Nature's nice here. 
                    You'll see. 

287
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,388
    We'll do some fishing,      
       a little hiking,         

288
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,391
       and then... this!        

289
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,859
           ( gasps )            

290
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,828
        A treasure map?         

291
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,030
          What? No.             
      It's Old Youthful.        

292
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,232
      One of the oldest         
      geysers on Earth.         

293
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,768
       - And guess when         
        it's erupting.          
           - Today?             

294
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,605
          Mmmm-hmmmm.           

295
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,774
         Well, we got           
       a big day ahead.         

296
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,709
              Let's get started.

297
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,244
Aren't your parents coming?     

298
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,012
              Nah. You know how 
              most parents show 

299
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,348
                 slide shows of 
                their vacation? 
           Mine show paintings. 

300
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,951
And done. Next.                 

301
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,021
So it's just                    
the two of us then?             

302
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,090
      Yeah. Is that okay?       

303
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,427
         ( explosion )          

304
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,440
           Camping!!            

305
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,941
     Dad!                       

306
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,950
Dad, oh, it's always            
great to see you.               

307
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,318
But what are you                
doing here?                     

308
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,554
         ( straining )          

309
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,293
   What, I can't go camping     
    with my own daughter?       

310
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,262
   I taught you how to camp.    

311
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,398
Yeah, and now Marco's           
showing me how to go            
camping here on Earth.          

312
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,500
   Really? Is he showing you    

313
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,837
         how to stalk           
    a Narinthian tar beast      

314
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,574
       for eleven days          
        with no food,           

315
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,843
          no sleep,             
       and no clothes?!         

316
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,978
      No, Dad, nature's         
      really nice here.         

317
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,914
    Look at what it gave me.    

318
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,149
          Love bites.           

319
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,785
Here, Marco. Show Dad           
how to Earth fish.              

320
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,187
                  Yeah, sure.   

321
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,357
     Whoa. So, how do I...      

322
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,459
       Amazing. Now what?       

323
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,261
        You're already doing it.

324
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,830
                       Yay, Dad!

325
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,767
       Now we just sit          
          and wait.             

326
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,775
    You wait for the fish       
       to come to you?          

327
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,377
          Just relax            
     and take it all in.        

328
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,780
      ( breathing deeply )      

329
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,382
             Ah!                
      Smell that? Okay.         

330
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,717
         Where'd he go?         

331
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,719
   Fishing!!                    

332
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,355
Take that and that.             

333
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,624
     Is that what fishing       
     on Mewni looks like?       

334
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,529
     It says Old Youthful       
    actually got its name       

335
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,331
     from early settlers        
         who believed           

336
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,799
         that it had            
     rejuvenating powers.       

337
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:28,833
 That sounds really--           

338
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,368
            Boring!             

339
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,370
      Why are we walking        
           so slow?             

340
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,006
      Well, I was trying        
       to take it easy,         

341
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,375
      'cause, you know,         
  what you did to your foot.    

342
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,578
         But I don't            
        even feel it.           

343
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,981
Come on, let me                 
magic you up some boots.        

344
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,716
   I don't need any of that.    

345
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,251
    I don't even need feet.     

346
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,585
           Can you do this, huh?

347
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,753
                Can you do this?

348
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,821
          I don't think you can.

349
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,422
       Want a piggyback         
         ride, honey?           

350
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,158
 Aw, Dad. No.                   

351
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,828
      Since when are you        
too cool for piggyback rides?   

352
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,163
    Well, I'm not too cool      
      for a piggyback--         

353
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,498
  That would be weird, Marco.   

354
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,567
Race you to                     
the water thing.                

355
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,536
          ( laughing )          

356
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,605
   - Is that the right way?     
            - No.               

357
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,608
Is your dad okay?               

358
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,210
               I think so.      

359
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,113
     He just really loves       
    family camping trips.       

360
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,849
    Okay, where'd you go,       
           big guy?             

361
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,050
            Got him.            

362
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,652
       What's he doing          
        way up there?           

363
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,889
                  Hey, Dad.     

364
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,090
           Everything all right?

365
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,826
      Sh. Staring contest.      

366
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,897
         Whoa! That's           
        a bald eagle.           

367
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,433
       We are breakin'          
 a whole bunch of laws here.    

368
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,567
              He started it.    

369
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,536
Marco's right, Dad.             

370
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,971
Let's go see                    
Old Youthful.                   

371
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,539
     Don't worry, darling.      

372
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,441
         Once I break           
   his spirit with my eyes,     

373
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,976
      he'll fly us there.       

374
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,512
     ( speaking gibberish )     

375
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,717
     Llama pajama llama...      

376
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,053
        pa... ja... ma.         

377
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,089
    This guy's unbelievable.    

378
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,425
  You can't let him beat you    
in front of your own daughter.  

379
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,460
     She looks up to you.       
       Does she though?         

380
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,329
         What is that           
      supposed to mean?         

381
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,830
       Did you notice,          
    she's pretty much over      

382
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,266
    your piggyback rides.       
   She used to love those.      

383
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,667
     And she went camping       
         without you.           

384
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,569
       That Marco kid's         
   probably her boyfriend.      

385
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,937
         What? No way.          

386
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,939
        My little girl          
      isn't dating yet.         

387
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,108
     Whatever. Keep lying       
    to yourself, old man.       

388
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,545
- Old? Who are you calling old? 
     - ( siren blaring )        

389
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,655
Something is definitely         
goin' on with my dad.           

390
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,857
 Okay, everything's cool.       

391
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:36,027
Turns out that feathered        
thing was some kind of          
a sacred animal.                

392
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,595
 Heads up would've been nice.   

393
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,497
       You folks better         
        get a move on           

394
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,499
       if you wanna see         
       that old geyser.         

395
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,502
     Who are you calling        
       an old geezer?!          

396
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,505
          Oh. Geyser.           

397
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:52,276
 Yes, Dad, the thing Marco's    
 been trying to see all day.    

398
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,278
                   We can still 
               make it in time. 

399
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,749
              This trail should 
            take us straight... 
                         to it. 

400
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,618
      Let me see that map.      

401
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,554
           Is he eating the map?

402
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,323
         I was hungry.          

403
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,825
Everything is food when you're  
    struggling to survive.      

404
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,460
 Except we're not on...         

405
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,362
             Mewni.             

406
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,663
         Right. Sorry.          

407
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,966
                    I'm staying 
           positive about this. 

408
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:17,468
            One of those trails 
              is the right one. 

409
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,536
          Maybe we'll get lucky.

410
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,738
     Eeny, meeny, miney...      

411
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,674
            Nooooo!             

412
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,343
 You know what?                 

413
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,746
     I think this may be        
          my fault.             

414
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,182
   You kids wait right here     
   while I score us a ride.     

415
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,584
Oh, man, if he could            
get us a ride,                  
that would be...                

416
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,691
                    ( groaning )

417
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,894
     You'll never make it       
     to Old Youthful now.       

418
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,930
 He goes off in five minutes,   
  and it's a ten-mile hike.     

419
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,566
I'm sorry, Marco.               

420
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,201
         Oh, come on,           
     what's the big deal?       

421
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,037
 - Dad, what is up with you?    
  - Is this about the bear?     

422
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,040
     No, Dad. You've been       
 acting really weird all day,   

423
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,376
    and now, Marco's plans      
    are basically ruined.       

424
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,778
   He really wanted to see      
        Old Youthful.           

425
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,581
   No, Star, I've seen it,      
       like, ten times.         

426
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,450
    I wanted you to see it.     

427
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,718
                You've shown me 
                    all kind of 
                  amazing stuff 

428
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,053
                   I never knew 
                       existed. 

429
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,589
        I just wanted           
       to pay you back.         

430
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,891
      Show you something        
    amazing here on Earth.      

431
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,527
             Marco!             

432
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,096
             Marco.             

433
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,798
   I guess we can come back     
  to see Old Youthful erupt     

434
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,633
                some other time.

435
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,235
Oh, you poor,                   
poor boy.                       

436
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,537
  - Didn't nobody tell you?     
           - What?              

437
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,440
      This here eruption        
    is gonna be the last.       

438
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,076
           - What?!             
 - Those big-city scientists    

439
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,712
 gave that geyser a look-see,   
    and he's all dried up.      

440
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,248
He's been fadin' away           
for years.                      

441
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,816
Oh, he used to be               
impressive.                     

442
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,751
 King of the geysers.           

443
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,488
But now, he's just              
a sad shadow of                 
his former glory.               

444
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,656
Aged out                        
and obsolete.                   

445
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,292
Ready to retire                 
and getting in                  
everybody's way.                

446
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,628
       Yes, sir, to use         
       clever wordplay,         

447
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,830
         Old Youthful           
    is plumb out of youth.      

448
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,899
              We should just go.

449
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,404
         Yes, Marco.            
        We will go...           

450
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:03,074
      and see that geyser.      

451
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,409
                Didn't you hear 
            what that guy said? 

452
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,611
                It's impossible.

453
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:07,745
             Is it?             

454
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,980
           Tick-tock.           

455
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,617
          ( slowly )            
        Tick... tock.           

456
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,985
     What do you say, Star?     

457
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,721
One last piggyback              
ride from your old man?         

458
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,724
             We're almost there!

459
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,460
 Just a glacier and two more    
      war re-enactments.        

460
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,695
You hear that, Dad?             

461
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,530
      Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.       

462
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,971
                No!             

463
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,076
              Dad!              

464
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,178
     I'm so sorry, pumpkin.     

465
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,746
        I let you down.         

466
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,882
       Are you out of your mind?

467
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,717
      You ran ten miles         
       in five minutes.         

468
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,353
        That's, like,           
      150 miles an hour.        

469
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,855
      I used to be able         
  to do it in four minutes.     

470
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,857
       I'm not the dad          
     I used to be, Star.        

471
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,660
   You need someone younger     
   to take care of you now.     

472
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:33,097
       Someone like...          
  your boyfriend Marco here.    

473
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,032
     I'm not her boyfriend.     

474
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,735
You fell up a waterfall, dude.  
        Who does that?          

475
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,939
     I'm older, too, Dad,       
    but I still need you.       

476
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,941
No matter                       
how old I get,                  

477
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,244
   you'll always be my hero,    

478
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,980
because you'll always           
be my dad.                      

479
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,750
        Come here, you.         

480
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,020
             Well, it's gettin' 
                    chilly out, 

481
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,924
             so what do you say 
                 we go find you 
                    some pants? 

482
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,462
       ( loud rumbling )        

483
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,938
             Wow!!              

484
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,375
           You gotta stop lying 
                to the tourists 
        about that geyser, man. 

485
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,777
Yeah, I know,                   
But it sure is fun.             

486
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,812
 Marco.                         

487
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,048
It's beautiful.                 

488
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,951
         ( loud crash )         

489
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,092
          Look, Star.           

490
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,562
Dad. You're so young.           

491
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,098
       Yeah. Fresh-out-         
       the-womb young.          

492
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,167
         Brand-new dad!         

493
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,935
            And here's the king 
              with his arms up. 

494
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,570
            And here's the king 
         putting his arms down. 

495
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,139
         And here he is walking 
             out of the crater. 

496
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,007
                   And climbing 
             out of the crater. 

497
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,910
This is so much better          
than a slide show.
