00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,582
        Oh, Queen Moon!         

122
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,551
  To what do we owe the,        
  uh, honor of this visit?      

123
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,288
           I'm sorry to intrude.
           Please accept this   
           bag of corn.         

124
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,591
         BRUDO: Corn?!          
      We don't need corn!       

125
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,559
   We're doing great, thanks!   

126
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,230
But perhaps we can find         
someone else who could use it!  

127
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:42,200
So, what brings you here,       
Queen Moon?                     

128
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:47,072
      I'm here because your son 
      took a very important book
      from my family.           

129
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,674
    My son? Which one?          

130
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,210
     Crudo?                     
                   Uh, no.      

131
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,379
  Not Yudo!                     
                   Hunh-uh.     

132
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,248
   Menudo?                      
                  Uh, nope.     

133
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,450
 Ugh. Okay, I'm just gonna      
 go down the list.              

134
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,620
 Dudo, Kudo, Mudo, Tudo,        

135
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:05,457
   Fudo, Zudo, Udo...           
    I have no idea who that is. 

136
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,026
          Not Dennis!           

137
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,264
      No, no, it's...it's Ludo. 

138
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,033
      (gasps) Ludo?!            

139
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,003
Well, we don't say that name    
in this house anymore!          

140
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:22,007
Not since he and his goons      
took over our castle            
and changed the locks           

141
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,408
when we were on vacation!       

142
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,011
 Not that this place            
 isn't lovely...                

143
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,014
                Do you know     
                where he is now?

144
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,315
   We don't.                    

145
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:34,119
You know, he is                 
a grave disappointment to us.   

146
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,587
             BRUDO:             
   Well, what do you expect?!   

147
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,257
     We had a lot of kids.      
     Ludo was the runt.         

148
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,461
    He didn't even fit          
    in our family portrait.     

149
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,664
   We were extra hard on him    
   to toughen him up.           

150
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,132
    And look what happened!     

151
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,401
      Was he grateful? No!      

152
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:53,271
     Instead, he destroyed      
     our ancestral home         

153
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,142
and brought shame               
on the family name.             

154
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,643
               There, there.    

155
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:03,248
        We can't always control 
        the path our children   
        choose to take.         

156
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,018
          Thank you,            
          Lord and Lady Avarius.

157
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,489
          If you hear from Ludo,
          please let me know.

       I have a job to do,      

168
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:32,110
        and I can't leave       
        until it's done.        

169
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,714

00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,316

           Song Day celebration?

171
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,019
            In just a day,      
            the people of Mewni 
            will be expecting us

172
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,654
     to perform this traditional
     Princess Song--            
   Ah-ah-ah!                    

173
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:42,654
  I don't want to hear it,      
  Songstrel.                    

174
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:47,192
If you don't leave right now,   
maybe I'll leave for good.      

175
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,060
                   Hey, Star!   

176
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,062
       Before you leave us alone
again--                         

177
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,031
          for a very long time  
          with no explanation-- 

178
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,401
   could you help me make some  
   more popcorn in the kitchen? 

179
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,373
                   Kit-chen!    

180
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,147
   Please. Just do what he says.

181
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,616
         He's been singing at me
         for eight hours,       
         asking where you are!  

182
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,285
  Well, I'm sorry,              
  but I don't want              

183
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,187
anything to do with Ruberiot    
and his stupid Princess Songs.  

184
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,624
  My mom's was so stupid        
  and so fake and so            
old-fashioned--                 

185
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,459
  it's just not me.             

186
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,161
                It's okay, Star.

187
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,297
          Everyone knows you're 
          anything but ordinary.

188
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,232
     Aww. Thanks, Marco.        

189
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,700
          Huuuugs.              

190
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,137
          He's, uh--            

191
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,705
         he's staring at us,    
         isn't he?              

192
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,577
             Yup.               
               Ugghh! Fine.     

193
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,478
      Ru-ber-i-ot,              

194
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,180
      if that even is           
      your real name--          

195
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,650
You. Me. My room. Talk time.    

196
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,857
          ( rustling )          

197
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,161
  I know you're there.          

198
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,363
  Come on out, if you know      
  what's good for you.          

199
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,468
    What do you want?           

200
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,237
          It's me. Dennis.      

201
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,706
     You were just at my house. 

202
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,277
 Why are you following me?      

203
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,113
         Are you looking for    
         my big brother because 
         you want to help him?  

204
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,414
      Help him what?            

205
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,749
              He's not well.    

206
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,584
  Do you know where he is?      

207
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,252
          I can take you to him.

208
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,321
  Oh, uh-- What<i> is</i> this?        

209
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,590
    We must go by wing, M'lady. 

210
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,192
       Oh.                      

211
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,293
  All right, then,              

212
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,327
  well, let me just--           
  hold on--                     

213
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,896
       ( gasping )              

214
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,544
        He's over there.        

215
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,152
      ( angry squawking )       

216
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,823
              What is that?     

217
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,864
              ( gasps )         

218
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,365
   What is it?                  
             We have to go.     

219
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,502
           We have to go<i> now.</i>   

220
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,708
It's an honor to be             
your official songstrel,        
Your Highness.                  

221
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,510
I have some really              
exciting ideas                  

222
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,378
that I can't wait               
to get your opinion on.         

223
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,680
               Ruby, just stop. 

224
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,548
           Please. I know       
           my mom sent you here,

225
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,317
       but honestly, I am sorry,
       I can't help you.        

226
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,187
        Princess Songs          
        are objectively awful.  

227
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,356
        They are these          
        trite little puff pieces

228
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,192
 about perfect little princesses
 with perfect little eyes,      

229
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,727
            and that's not me!  

230
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:38,196
        And songstrels like you 
        are part of the problem!

231
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:42,333
   Your music just puts pressure
   on future princesses         
   to be perfect!               

232
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,869
       So you might as well     
       take your stupid notebook

233

        and your stupid lute    
        and go back to Mewni,   

234
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,274
     because I have no interest 
     in helping some stupid hack

235
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,443
   write a stupid Princess Song!

236
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:54,446
     Oh, really?                
                Yeah, really!   

237
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,347
Fine. But for what it's worth,  

238
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,650
I also think the songstrels     
before me were hacks.           

239
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,552
            You didn't think    
            I had an opinion?   

240
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,821
            That maybe I had    
            some integrity?     

241
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,924
   I wanted to write a real song
   about a real princess,       

242
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,226
   with all her gifts and flaws.

243
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,362
   Don't Mewmans deserve to know
   their future queen?

            (choking up)

00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,301

     just take your mom's song  

246
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,269
      and just plug your name in
      and be done with it!      

247
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,372
             You know, like     
             some kind of hack? 

248
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,541
   Wait! Ah, no!

  I know it's not very          
  princess-like to show up late,

300
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
   but did you see traffic

        I just want to say how--
        how proud I am of you.

 aren't exactly your cup of tea,

305
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,565

         hard on your sometimes,

306
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,468
 so it means a lot to me that   
 you still went through with it.
