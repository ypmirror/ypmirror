           I love it!

00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,859

00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,728
                 Fun sleepover, 
                     huh, guys? 

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,530
     Best sleepover ever!!      

26
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,900
    And it's about to get       
        a lot better.           

27
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,334
    ( ticking, alarm rings )    

28
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,537
         I never made           
       brownies before.         

29
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,106
         I used real            
       magic sprinkles.         

30
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,008
                ALL: Mmm!       

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,777
                 So good, right?

32
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,746
                     Yes!       

33
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,715
          Oh, so good.          

34
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:27,586
 ( jazzy piano music playing )  

35
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,094
        Oh, hey, girls.         

36
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,762
          I was just            
      practicing piano.         

37
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,430
           It's jazz.           

38
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,099
           Hi, Marco.           

39
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,434
      Oh, I didn't know         
   you played, Marco. Yeah!     

40
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,141
       Oh, hey, Jackie.         
    Didn't see you there.       

41
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,043
             Whoa!              

42
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,744
         Are you okay?          

43
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,813
  Why don't you come and try    
     one of my brownies?        

44
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:59,251
Brownies? These days,           
I'm sticking with               
the protein shakes.             

45
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,386
       It's what keeps          
    these bad boys happy.       

46
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,823
                Oh, oh, uh-huh. 
                You got it bad. 

47
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,892
Bad? No.                        
( nervous laughter )            

48
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,260
 ( stammering )                 

49
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,895
          It's game time, Marco.

50
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,431
       And since you're so good 
          at playing the field, 

51
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,299
              I got a game that 
      would be perfect for you. 

52
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,435
           ALL: Wow!            

53
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,903
          It's a box.           

54
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,907
         It's called            
     Truth Or Punishment.       

55
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,675
It's all about                  
telling your friends            

56
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,078
your deepest,                   
darkest secrets.                

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,847
              And I'm out.      

58
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,682
            Give me one second. 
                         Marco! 

59
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,985
  Marco, Marco, Marco, Marco.   

60
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,087
Why don't you wanna play?       

61
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,656
             I just think maybe 
         some things are better 
                  kept secrets. 

62
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,091
What are you                    
talking about?                  

63
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,627
Oh, Marco,                      
come play with us.              

64
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,762
         Yeah, Marco.           
     Come share a secret.       

65
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,165
        - He's coming.          
        - I hate you.           

66
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,868
    Okay, you're supposed       
   to ask three questions,      

67
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,637
       each one harder          
        than the last,          

68
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,505
        and all we do           
    is answer them. So...       

69
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,679
      Deceit and fables,        
      lies and fiction,         

70
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,614
          even with             
     complete conviction.       

71
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,350
      If truth is absent        
      from these events,        

72
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,353
        all will face           
       the punishments.         

73
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,889
    - What does that mean?      
- It means if you lie to him,   

74
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,791
       something bad'll         
           happen.              

75
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,893
    Pledge an oath of truth.    

76
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,863
     - Pinky swear to me.       
           - Okay.              

77
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,032
      I promise to tell         
          the truth.            

78
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,134
         - The truth.           
         - The truth.           

79
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,903
         - The truth.           
         - The truth.           

80
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,872
                      The truth.

81
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,342
        It's time for           
     Truth Or Punishment.       

82
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,311
        Pony, this is           
       already awesome.         

83
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,246
      The first question:       

84
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,556
           Uh, Pony?            

85
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,092
Oh, girl, maybe the first one   
        is very easy.           

86
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,827
   The next one's probably      
    something interesting,      

87
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,729
      like have you ever        
        killed a man.           

88
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,331
        Mm, actually,           
      that's still easy.        

89
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,832
                     Pony Head, 
                favorite color? 

90
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,535
   - Pony Head color. Done.     
           - What?              

91
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,170
     It's a very popular        
       color on Mewni.          

92
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,939
Uh, Star, what's                
your favorite color?            

93
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,875
               Uh, I have to go 
                   with yellow. 

94
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,344
( gasps )                       
Me, too.                        

95
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,246
                    No way!     

96
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,681
       ( both giggling )        

97
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,253
          - Jackie?             
        - Neon green.           
        How about you?          

98
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,954
               Well, I like red.

99
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,889
                      Blood red?

100
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,627
     Uh... no. Just like,       
          putty red.            

101
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,395
             Well, I like black.

102
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,930
        I can see that.         

103
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,398
Oh, black is                    
my second favorite.             

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,966
     Black is pretty cool.      

105
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,302
       Someone is lying.        

106
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,041
        ( all laughing )        

107
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,881
      One of us, speak up.      

108
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,049
             Okay.              

109
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,218
          I love pink.          

110
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,553
       It's my favorite.        

111
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,589
           - Truth.             
        - ALL: Pink?!           

112
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,991
   I just hate contributing     
    to gender stereotypes.      

113
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,628
       Janna likes pink         
  and fights the patriarchy.    

114
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,804
       That was awesome!        

115
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,840
      Yeah. It's, like,         
    we're inside the game.      

116
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,909
        Second question.        

117
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,484
       Easy. Everybody          
      loved my brownies.        

118
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,687
    Okay, yeah, they were       
     very watchamacallit,       

119
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,856
  - very good, right, guys?     
   - Yeah, they were great.     

120
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,326
   Yep. Good brownies, Star.    

121
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,027
   Actually, I didn't have      
          a brownie,            

122
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,929
          so I guess            
        I missed out.           

123
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:35,300
  Oh, that's too bad, Marco,    
because they were really good.  

124
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,935
            Jackie?             

125
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,438
        Yeah. Delicious.        

126
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,307
           - What?!             
  - What's happening to us?     

127
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,642
          ( whinnies )          

128
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,878
       Someone is lying.        

129
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,882
    And this is what lies       
   look like on the inside.     

130
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,217
       ( all screaming )        

131
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,219
       Wait. Who didn't         
      like my brownies?         

132
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,887
    I just... ha ha... uh...    

133
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,856
  I told you, I didn't even     
       have a brownie.          

134
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,858
   Somebody tell the truth.     
            Quick.              

135
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,827
          Okay. Fine.           

136
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,295
      Sorry, Star, I lied.      

137
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,897
      Those were, like,         
   the worst brownies ever.     

138
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,900
            - Huh?              
         - Poor Star.           

139
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,869
       Okay, I lied, too.       

140
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,505
        Those brownies          
      tasted like dirt.         

141
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,073
   Okay, if I had a stomach,    

142
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,376
     I would be very sick       
 inside of the stomach, okay?   

143
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,045
Well, I loved                   
her brownies.                   

144
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,550
Okay, okay, I lied.             

145
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,619
         The brownies           
        were horrible.          

146
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,758
     Okay, I don't wanna        
   play this game anymore.      

147
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,927
  Yeah. I'm sorry I brought     
    this stupid game now.       

148
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,929
      Come on, let's go         
    to the Bounce Lounge.       

149
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,732
         - Good idea.           
   - Let's get outta here.      

150
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,234
         Nobody leaves          

151
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,437
       until you answer         
     the final question.        

152
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,911
        Okay, let's do          
       something else.          

153
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,913
  Okay, guys, we can do this.   

154
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,348
      Let's just answer         
        and end this.           

155
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,783
       Go ahead, game.          
         We're ready.           

156
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:01,586
       Who do you have          
         a crush on?            

157
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,222
  Okay, this really cute guy    
 from skate camp last summer.   

158
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,390
       He's really nice.        

159
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,793
           ALL: Aww!            

160
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,895
     See? That was easy.        
   Okay, now you go, Marco.     

161
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,530
          No, thanks.           

162
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,031
        I, uh, I'm good.        

163
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,966
      It's Star's turn,         
          I'm sure.             

164
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,401
      I say who goes next,      

165
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,771
          and I say             
       Star goes next.          

166
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,374
        Oscar Greeson.          
    Everybody knows that.       

167
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,775
 Good choice.                   

168
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,244
         Star Fan 13,           
         your crush?            

169
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,047
Star Butterfly,                 
of course.                      

170
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,148
           Pony Head?           

171
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,817
       If we're really          
      being honest here,        

172
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,785
 and we're gonna be vulnerable, 

173
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,153
    I guess I just have to      
      admit it and say,         

174
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,456
           it's me.             
        I love myself.          

175
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,157
                  Go, Pony.     

176
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:43,428
  Well, I think we all know     
    who I have a crush on.      

177
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,797
      - Don't we, Marco?        
           - Uh...              

178
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,566
      Eighteenth-century        
       poet John Keats.         

179
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,167
      Ha ha.                    

180
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,305
Okay, Marco Diaz.               
Your crush.                     

181
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,606
     Oh, Marco, you don't       
          have to...            

182
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,509
     No. It's... it's fine.     

183
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,445
           Ugh. Okay.           

184
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,014
          My crush...           

185
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,117
     my crush is on Jackie.     

186
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,186
    - Jackie Lynn Thomas.       
           - What?              

187
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:13,625
        Somebody lied           
          big time!             

188
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,293
           Who lied?!           

189
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,628
    Janna, was it you again?    

190
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,263
     No. It is John Keats.      

191
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,298
     Mine is the cute guy       
       from skate camp.         

192
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,267
Ha ha. I love Star.             

193
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,369
   And I love Oscar Greeson.    

194
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,004
             Marco!             

195
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,807
      I told you, I have        
      a crush on Jackie.        

196
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,108
          At least,             
        I think I do.           

197
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,643
  What does that really mean?   

198
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,712
         I put her on           
    this sort of pedestal.      

199
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,647
    So do I like the image      
            of her              

200
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,382
     or who she really is?      

201
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,118
  I mean, I like her enough     
  to know that she deserves     

202
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,354
someone who wants to get to know
 her, which is definitely me.   

203
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,324
              Wow!              

204
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,394
           I always             
      get to the truth,         

205
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,029
         but that...            
        kudos, really.          

206
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,699
   But you weren't the one      
          who lied!!            

207
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,038
       ( evil laughter )        

208
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,440
      Don't worry, guys.        
         I got this.            

209
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,180
             Star!              

210
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,815
                          Marco!

211
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,251
                      Jump!     

212
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,774
       ( evil laughter )        

213
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,909
   Stop it! What did we do      
       to deserve this?         

214
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,945
              Lies are a plague.

215
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,680
          - A virus.            
          - A weed.             

216
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,215
   - And to stop a weed...      
  - You must kill the root.     

217
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,784
         But it's not           
        really lying.           

218
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,119
              Huh?              

219
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,122
  Sometimes, you don't know     
       what you think.          

220
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,224
          Your head             
   and your heart disagree.     

221
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,293
      You think you know        
how you feel about something,   

222
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,529
      but then it changes.      

223
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,230
                   Pony, ask me 
             my favorite color. 

224
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,899
You already said it.            
It's yellow.                    

225
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,201
       - Ask me again.          
- What's your favorite color?   

226
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,437
        Right now? Blue.        

227
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,105
         Wait! Stop it!         

228
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,740
    - You can't change...       
         - Your mind.           

229
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,442
      Jackie, who do you        
       have a crush on?         

230
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,211
                Uh... I don't...

231
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,312
           I don't know anymore.

232
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,448
             No!                
        ( shrieking )           

233
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,783
  You think that everything     
     is black and white,        

234
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,884
         and you can't.         

235
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,086
             Stop!              

236
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,154
       It's a bunch of          
       different colors         

237
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,124
    A rainbow of feelings       
   that's always changing.      

238
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,235
   STAR: Thanks for coming      
       to my sleepover.         

239
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,837
                   Thanks, Star.

240
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,439
     - Crazy night, huh?        
        - Yeah. Crazy.          

241
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,842
      See ya at school,         
            Marco.              

242
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,479
 Bye, ladies.                   

243
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,781
 Uh, hey.                       

244
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,183
What say we get                 
our Sunday morning              
breakfast burritos?             

245
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,586
           Nah. Not today, Star.

246
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,455
          I'm gonna go catch up 
                   on some Z's. 

247
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:01,326
            My room's that way. 
                    ( giggles ) 

248
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,761
             Marco?             

249
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,097
                     Marco Diaz!

250
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:10,602
    Truth. Star Butterfly       
      has a crush on...         

251
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,176
    Thanks for meeting us       
    here today, Rasticore.      

252
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,279
         We have a problem with 
         some rogue princesses, 

253
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,447
         which I hope           
    you can help us with.       

254
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,716
          ( growling )          

255
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,523
    Destroy the blonde one,     

256
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,292
  but bring the dark-haired     
          one to me.            

257
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,301
         ( stammering )         

258
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,403
         Gimme a break.         

259
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,408
          - Do you--            
       - Working on it.         

260
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,717
Oh, Miss Heinous,               

261
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,319
I cannot wait to recapture      
our former glory.               

262
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,222
It has been a long time         
since I last ate.               

263
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,424
    - ( stomach rumbling )      
          - Indeed.             

264
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,059
                Here. Take this.

265
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,061
        The last of our savings.

266
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,497
Oh, you're so generous,         
Miss Heinous.                   

267
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,333
Finally, some little food       
for my mouth.                   

268
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,435
      It's not for food,        
          you fool.             

269
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,270
               It's for my hair.

270
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:22,273
  Miss Fairol's number 112.     
        Golden brown.           

271
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,242
       And bring back a receipt!

272
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,044
          ( laughing )          

273
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:29,114
    "Billie's Ballet Shoe       
          Emporium.             

274
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,382
      Our discounts are         
         on pointe"?            

275
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,385
              Marco, why do you 
                even have this? 

276
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,454
For your information,           

277
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,357
they are incredibly             
comfortable to wear             
around the house.               

278
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,793
What are you guys doing         
looking through my wallet       
anyway?                         

279
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,129
Can't a guy get                 
any privacy?                    

280
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,264
           - Nope.              
      - Hey, what's with        
       this weird card?         

281
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,799
                 It's all shaky.

282
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,567
 Let me see that.               

283
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,437
  Hey, this is the Quest Buy    
gift card I got for you, Marco. 

284
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,773
       I can't believe          
   you haven't used it yet.     

285
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,642
 I got this for our six-month   
     friendship-aversary        

286
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,444
  so you could get yourself     
      something special.        

287
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,379
     If you don't use it,       
        it'll expire.           

288
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,582
Look, Star, it's not that       
I don't appreciate it, okay?    

289
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:08,486
It's just that the last time    
I went to Quest Buy,            
I almost got killed.            

290
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,322
         But, Marco,            
     it expires tonight.        

291
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,291
            Come on!            

292
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,659
          ( whimpers )          

293
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,662
( sighs )                       
Fine. Let's go.                 

294
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,397
         Yay. Perfect!          

295
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,733
   - Back in a bit, Janna.      
          - Laters.             

296
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,536
   All right, let's get you     
      the perfect gift!         

297
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,172
            Oh, no.             

298
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,673
     See anything you like?     

299
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,176
        Look. There's           
     a Skullaroid camera.       

300
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,144
        Takes pictures          
   specifically of ghosts.      

301
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,979
Uh, I don't think so.           

302
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,416
  Oh, how about some spooky     
    haunted garden gnomes?      

303
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,784
Look at all this stuff.         

304
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,486
This is exactly why             
I do not like shopping.         

305
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,987
I can never                     
make up my mind.                

306
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,789
         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

307
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,125
         Easy there,            
       Mr. Picky Pants.         

308
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,427
       Luckily, we got          
       until midnight.          

309
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:06,010
 Tell me where Princess Star    
and Princess Marco are located. 

310
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,513
          Uh, loud.             
   They went to Quest Buy.      

311
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,982
         The one near           
     the galactic vortex,       

312
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,717
       or the one with          
     the big parking lot?       

313
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,786
          ( growling )          

314
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,556
Never mind.                     
I found them.                   

315
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,529
            Come on.            

316
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,806
     Why did you even ask       
     if you already knew?       

317
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,909
     Ooh, that is getting       
a little too close for comfort. 

318
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,478
Marco, I don't mean             
to rush you,                    

319
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,347
 but it's been hours.           

320
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,815
If you don't find               
something soon,                 

321
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,351
the card will expire            
and go to waste.                

322
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,386
      You know it's hard for me 
             to shop in public. 

323
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,356
 Plus I'm just not that into    
       Quest Buy gear.          

324
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,559
          Ugh, Marco!           

325
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,929
     They have literally        
everything in the universe here.

326
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,865
  There has to be something     
          you want.             

327
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,700
 Please!!                       

328
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,602
 Hurry up!!                     

329
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,271
       If you're going          
         to rush me,            

330
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,339
      then I'll just buy        
   some piece of junk now,      

331
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,909
  and come back to exchange     
       it later, okay?          

332
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,282
        What the heck?!         

333
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,684
( laughing )                    
Oh, yeah. That.                 

334
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,519
I may have forgotten            
to mention that this is         

335
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,855
a "friends to the end"          
gift card.                      

336
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,524
You have to truly, deeply       
want the item you spend it on,  

337
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,293
 or else it won't work.         

338
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:31,529
 Star, why would you give me    
      a card like that?         

339
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,799
Because I wanted to get you     
something you really liked.     

340
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,268
                Okay. Fine.     

341
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,104
Just, uh, nothing               
in this section.                

342
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,206
     Good, 'cause I don't       
       like you either.         

343
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,442
          I see why             
       you're on sale.          

344
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,777
All right, all right.           

345
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,545
            - Ugh!              
      - How about this?         

346
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,780
       No, no. Too gaudy.       

347
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,315
         How about one of these?

348
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,649
Another keychain?               
I'll pass.                      

349
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,418
         How about one of these?

350
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,219
Uh, maybe. Nah.                 

351
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,621
                 How about this?

352
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,624
Star, you know the neck         
is gonna stretch out on that.   

353
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,426
Ow! All right, all right!       

354
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,595
I'm sorry, but I really         
can't decide under              
this kind of pressure.          

355
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,297
Maybe we can get                
an extension on the card.       

356
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,498
       Well, we can try.        

357
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,434
          Excuse me.            
      I have a question.        

358
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,569
     - Not my department.       
- But you're customer service.  

359
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,839
           Oh, yeah.            

360
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,574
        We really need          
     to ditch that sign.        

361
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,576
   Fine. How can I help you?    

362
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,179
Is there any way we can         
extend the expiration date      
on this card?                   

363
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,647
  - Shouldn't be a problem.     
         - ( beeps )            

364
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,482
       Uh, you know what?       

365
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,518
    No. This is a "friends      
    to the end" gift card.      

366
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,687
   It's not only impervious     
          to change,            

367
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,991
    - but when it expires,      
          so do you.            
           - What?!             

368
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,625
                   Like, we die?

369
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:38,596
  Geez. Everyone's gotta die    
          some time.            

370
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,332
           This just guarantees 
        that you'll die sooner. 

371
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,268
       It's all here in         
the contract your friend signed.

372
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,771
     If you don't use it        
   by midnight, zap, ha ha.     

373
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,173
   Both of you get blasted      
        into oblivion.          

374
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,942
                          Zap?! 
           Tell me again, Star. 

375
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,177
      Why did you get me        
      a card like this?         

376
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,546
        I didn't know.          
 I never read the fine print.   

377
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,515
                    Always read 
          the fine print, Star. 

378
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,783
       I mean, look at          
        this contract.          

379
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,786
There's gotta be                
something we can do.            

380
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,621
              Nope. Sorry, dude.

381
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,656
                      Um, dudes.

382
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,625
      Seeing as there's         
    only a few hours left,      

383
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,794
             you better go find 
     something you really like. 

384
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,062
       ( both screaming )       

385
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,309
       Uh, yes, before you ask, 
              this is not my... 

386
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,647
    - Oh, no. Ten minutes       
         to midnight.           
        - We're toast.          

387
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,719
  Activating expiration mode.   

388
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,288
    Shooting star explosion!    

389
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,359
Enough nonsense.                
Choose your gift.               

390
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,227
          Your life             
        depends on it.          

391
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,663
     Commencing countdown       
   to your expiration date.     

392
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,632
     You have ten minutes.      

393
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,601
        - See anything          
       you like, Marco?         
            - No.               

394
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,570
         Nine minutes           
      until expiration.         

395
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,572
         - What about           
      gourmet hair gel?         
             - No               

396
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,108
      8.5 minutes until         
         expiration.            

397
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,010
        Who designed this card?!

398
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,611
Why do you have                 
to be so picky?                 

399
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,013
         I'm not picky.         

400
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,549
         I'm just...            
      highly selective.         

401
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,785
                    Wait, Star. 
                       Hold on. 

402
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,354
    The ultimate in privacy.    

403
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,723
  It's even my favorite color.  

404
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,693
               And a thumbprint 
               privacy setting. 
                     ( laughs ) 

405
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,462
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.       

406
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,729
 It's yours, Marco.             

407
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:19,897
Get it, get it,                 
get it out.                     

408
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,732
                  ( straining ) 
                    It's stuck. 

409
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,403
        - Sorry, sir.           
   That's a display model.      
       - ( screaming )          

410
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,605
                   We gotta get 
                  the Quest Buy 
     sloth employee to help us. 

411
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,340
          ( laughing )          

412
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,277
Stand back.                     

413
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,446
    My friend Marco needs       
 one of your privacy wallets.   

414
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,550
  Uh, well, I am on my break,   

415
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,619
    but, sure, let me check.    

416
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,321
        Can you see if          
    they have it in plum?       

417
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,324
    Uh, sorry. Looks like       
     we're out of stock.        

418
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,726
                No. It can't be.

419
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,828
          One minute            
        to expiration.          

420
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,064
           This is all my fault.

421
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,666
   I should've let you know     
there was an expiration date.   

422
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,803
        And I wasn't being lazy 
      when I bought that thing, 
                     I promise. 

423
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,272
I genuinely thought you would   
       love to pick out         

424
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,840
        what you wanted.        

425
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,676
     Sorry. Did you mean        
     jeans pig unwanted?        

426
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,778
I know a lot of this            
wouldn't have happened          

427
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,313
if I was easier                 
to shop for.                    

428
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,617
   Okay, I will search for      
     cheesier mop store.        

429
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,185
     Let's hug,                 

430
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,487
so when they find               
our charred skeletons,          

431
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,422
they'll know                    
we were friends.                

432
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:22,827
Sorry. There was zero results   
  for snow made worm pants.     

433
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,762
   Wait! I know what I want!    

434
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,698
 Hey, there's only one thing    
 in this whole stinkin' store   

435
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,368
   that I could ever want.      
    Star's my best friend,      

436
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,438
and friendship is the greatest  
  gift I could ever receive.    

437
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,677
You need to pick something      
you can purchase from the store.

438
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,779
Well, it was                    
worth a shot.                   

439
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,182
    - It was sweet, Marco.      
     - Preparing to honor       
         expiration.            

440
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,883
            Good-bye, Marco.    

441
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,552
Good-bye, Star.                 

442
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,822
          ( angry muttering )   

443
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,391
           Where are the stairs 
                 in this place? 

444
00:19:55,727 --> 00:20:00,731
    Princesses, my name is      
Rasticore Chaosus Disastorvayne.

445
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,900
     Miss Heinous sent me.      

446
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,340
                 Invalid entry. 
           Expiration imminent. 

447
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,542
      Hold it. We do have       

448
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,878
   one more privacy wallet      
          in stock.             

449
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,181
      - ( both exclaim )        
        - Only, sorry.          

450
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,350
   We don't have it in plum.    

451
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:22,186
   Just, we have it in, um,     
        Prussian blue.          

452
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:26,557
   ( sobbing )                  

453
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,826
Oh, it's perfect.               

454
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,695
        Prussian blue           
    is my favorite color.       

455
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:31,862
      Even more than plum.      

456
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,600
            Sheesh. So dramatic.

457
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,768
Good doing business             
with you, sir.                  

458
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,837
Contract obligation             
fulfilled.                      

459
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,075
           ( beeps )            

460
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,544
         ( explosion )          

461
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,547
     Well, that completes       
      your transaction.         

462
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,716
Have a good day, sir.           

463
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,384
          We got you            
 the perfect friendship gift!   

464
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,053
 What is with this thing?       

465
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,955
How the heck are you            
even supposed to open this?     

466
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,290
                Let me see that.

467
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,726
       Nice try, ladies.        

468
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,861
     Its thumbprint lock        
     will allow no man or       
  magical creature to ever--    

469
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,696
                         Got it.

470
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,798
    Janna, get out of town!     

471
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,201
- How did you do that, Janna?   
- I've got Marco's thumbprint.  

472
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,638
In fact, I've got all of your   
sensitive information, Marco.   

473
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,273
        Get outta town!!        

474
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,877
Delivery from                   
Quest Buy, milady.              

475
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,813
   But I wouldn't open it.      
 You're not going to like it.   

476
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:26,284
       Oh, well, then there are 
        two things in this room 
                  I don't like. 

477
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,655
           Rasticore!           

478
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:35,393
        I'll get you,           
       Princess Marco.          

479
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,729
 I'm sorry. What's the other    
    thing you don't like?
