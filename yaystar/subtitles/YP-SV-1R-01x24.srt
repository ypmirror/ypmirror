20
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,884
Oh, don't put

21
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,119
         ( straining )          

22
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,824
         Are you sure           
        this is safe?           

23
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,060
             I never said that. 
                Come on, Marco, 
                       you try. 

24
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,063
           Uh... no.            

25
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,697
         Suit yourself.         

26
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,566
          ( screams )           

27
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,234
        Huh? I gotcha,          
          I gotcha.             

28
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,118
           ( yawns )            

29
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,226
         ( screaming )          

30
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,770
              Let me just...    

31
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,622
       Star, we better          
       get out... Star!         

32
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,257
We gotta                        
get outta here.                 

33
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,793
      Star, pay attention.      

34
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,828
     Just a little closer.      

35
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,278
                    I had it in 
               my hands, Marco. 

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,313
                 I have no idea 
        what you were thinking. 

37
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,249
        I was thinking          
        of not dying.           

38
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,050
                   ( screaming )

39
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,424
       We went through          
      all that trouble,         

40
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,162
            and this sad little 
       scrap of sandwich is all 
        we have to show for it. 

41
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,997
That's because it's             
not worth dying for             

42
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,832
a stupid                        
piece of food.                  

43
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,402
I'm going                       
to my room.                     

44
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,137
         I hate when            
      you act like this.        

45
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,674
             It makes me wonder 
        why we're even friends. 

46
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,678
        Ugh! Where did          
  all these flies come from?    

47
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,917
       ( muffled scream )       

48
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,885
          ( snoring )           

49
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,087
    Don't call me butterfly.    

50
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,294
            So good.            

51
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,235
       Marco. I'm sorry.        

52
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,903
         I was a jerk.          

53
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,838
      It's just I really        
wanted you to try this sandwich.

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,874
      It's kinda smashed        
          and dirty,            

55
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,878
   but it's still delicious.    

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,813
             Marco?             

57
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,315
           No Marco.            

58
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,884
       Mr. and Mrs. Diaz.       

59
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,187
         Uh, what are           
       you guys doing?          

60
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:45,157
    Oh, Star, we were just      
     looking at Rafael's        

61
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,826
         old book of            
    medical illustrations.      

62
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,729
     Weird. Have you guys       
         seen Marco?            

63
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,998
       I think he went          
  to walk the laser puppies.    

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,766
                    Try calling 
            his cellular phone. 

65
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,101
      Oh, yeah. Good idea.      

66
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,746
 ( gasps ) The call is coming   
    from inside the house.      

67
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,382
             Marco?             

68
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,251
         There you are.         

69
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,453
What's up with everyone         
hanging out in the dark         

70
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,822
like a bunch of                 
weird-y weirds?                 

71
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,293
           Uh, Marco,           

72
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,495
       where'd you put          
          your legs?            

73
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,365
      What have you done        
         with Marco?            

74
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,768
   If you ever want to see      
     the boy alive again,       

75
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,806
      bring the wand to         
    Ludo's castle tonight.      

76
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,009
        And come alone.         

77
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,481
 ( laughing )                   

78
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,449
You're never                    
going to believe.               

79
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,885
The telephone                   
punched me in the face.         

80
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,955
      Did you find Marco?       

81
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,790
                  Uh...         

82
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,825
    And the little fly man      
        was all, like,          

83
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,862
( strange accent ) If you ever  
want to see Marco alive again-- 

84
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,298
    I just sounded Irish;       
       he wasn't Irish.         

85
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,966
       Write that down.         
        The thing is,           

86
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,968
      Ludo's been after my wand 
         ever since I got here. 

87
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,536
       He's never gonna get it; 
     it's, like, my birthright, 

88
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,271
      from a ba-jillion         
       generations ago,         

89
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,040
   starting with my great-great 
     great-great-great-great... 

90
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,309
Do you like magic,              
little girl?                    

91
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,877
                     I guess.   

92
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,879
     Me, too.                   

93
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,181
Heck, I used to go              
to Vegas every weekend          

94
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,350
           for magic.           

95
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,118
The thing about                 
magic is,                       

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,887
if you don't                    
use it wisely,                  

97
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,324
you can lose                    
everything.                     

98
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,593
  Anywho, not much I can do     
           for you.             

99
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,028
       If he's not back         
          tomorrow,             

100
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,831
  we'll send the bloodhounds    
           for him.             

101
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,099
          I told you            
     he wouldn't get it.        

102
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,600
        Well, we don't          
        get it either.          

103
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:39,004
       Look, this isn't         
      your fault, Star.         

104
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,039
  If anything, we should've     
  been paying more attention    

105
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,607
       to the two of you.       

106
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,609
I can get Marco                 
back from Ludo.                 

107
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,345
      Great. We'll take         
         the minivan.           

108
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,047
 No, a little fly said to me    
        to come alone.          

109
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,016
           - Hey...             
       - You're wrong,          
         by the way.            

110
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,351
       This is my fault.        

111
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,853
        I'll take care          
        of it myself.           

112
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,489
             Oh, Star, come on, 
         don't be like... that. 

113
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,257
      Forgot my scissors.       

114
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,952
        Oh, why bother?         

115
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,060
          What the...           

116
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,062
       ( clears throat )        

117
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,065
         Why you bother knocking

118
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,033
           when you just walked 
        through my living room? 

119
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,268
           I'm sorry!           

120
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,436
            Go away.            

121
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,605
I just wanna talk,              
Buff Frog.                      

122
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,407
             Buff Frog not even 
                       my name. 

123
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,109
        Really? Is it...        

124
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,011
           Butt Frog?           

125
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,081
    No, it's not Butt Frog.     

126
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,349
          Is it Chad?           

127
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,951
          My name is            
     Yvgeny Bulgoyaboff.        

128
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,554
     Oh. So you're foreign.     

129
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,322
       What do you want?        

130
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,258
             Okay.              

131
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,460
       At least let me          
  buy back your friendship.     

132
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,096
    You're going to love it.    

133
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,998
      Quiet.                    

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,434
                  Fine.         

135
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,202
                   Door is open.

136
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,445
You're not even                 
going to open it?               

137
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,113
           BOTH: Huh?           

138
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,015
Wait. Was that...               

139
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,650
                     Huh? No.   

140
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,052
             Marco!             

141
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,089
           Tadpoles?            

142
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,391
                      Ugh.      

143
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,259
Tadpoles?                       

144
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,428
    Where are my flip-flops?    

145
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,997
         Where's Marco?         

146
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,600
      I don't even know         
         who that is.           

147
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,969
     She's talking about        
         Karate Boy.            

148
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,971
       Please, no more          
         laser beam.            

149
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,074
   I swear, I have no idea      
    where your friend is.       

150
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,343
  Then why did you summon me    
       to your castle?          

151
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,513
       It is no longer          
         his castle.            

152
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,015
          He's right.           

153
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,117
   It's Toffee's castle now.    

154
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,085
            Toffee?             

155
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,655
        I have no idea          
        who that is...          

156
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,157
 ( babbling baby talk )         

157
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,492
 Ludo gave me babies.           

158
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,126
        Okay, I'm done.         

159
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,695
                     Wait, wait!

160
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,063
             Ludo.              

161
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,232
       I wanted to say          
          thank you             

162
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,568
        for giving me           
   the gift of fatherhood.      

163
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,470
     That wasn't a gift,        
       you ding-a-ling.         

164
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,172
        It was a bribe.         

165
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,074
    You see, the plan was,      
   I'd buy your friendship      

166
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,742
      with gifts because        
        we're friends,          

167
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,477
        and in return,          
      you'd kick Toffee         

168
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,346
   out of the castle for me     
    because we're friends.      

169
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,414
                    ( laughing )

170
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,583
      But then, Star showed up, 
  and I don't need you anymore, 

171
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,452
           you big old meatball.

172
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,465
  Well, looks like I've had     
all the fun I can have in here. 

173
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,167
           Oh, wait.            

174
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,303
         Now I'm done.          

175
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,072
 All right, you got me here.    
  What do you want with me?     

176
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,574
             What?              

177
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:05,143
           Tell him what you're 
               gonna do to him. 

178
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,646
                      Wait till 
                 you hear this. 

179
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,147
          Do you mind?          

180
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,049
               ( angry buzzing )

181
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,386
                Look, if you're 
                after the wand, 

182
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,187
      it's harder to get        
       than you think.          

183
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,556
   Lots of people have tried.   

184
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,591
              Eat something.    

185
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,293
                       Could be 
                your last meal. 

186
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,161
        Actually, I'm           
        totally full.           

187
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,429
    But if you're hungry,       
      I'm a great cook,         

188
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,164
   so why don't you let me      
      out of this chair         

189
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,265
   and I'll give you a taste.   

190
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,800
             Okay.              

191
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,439
             There's two of you?

192
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,378
     You really should eat.     

193
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,249
         I don't want           
   your stinking sandwich!      

194
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,084
        You're a disappointment.

195
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,586
 Yeah? Well, you're boring.     

196
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,287
      And you dress like        
          a lawyer.             

197
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,856
     At least that idiot        
came dressed for a good time.   

198
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,792
               I feel your pain.

199
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,729
Good luck                       
getting in there.               

200
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,265
Uh, there are keys              
in the door.                    

201
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,734
   That's obviously part of     
        Toffee's plan.          

202
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,803
          Looks like            
       these are yours.         

203
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,272
       Those aren't mine.       

204
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,374
Wait, wait, wait!               

205
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,177
You have no idea                
( panting )...                  

206
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,312
how powerful Toffee is.         

207
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,415
        What you need           
 is the element of surprise.    

208
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,417
        Lucky for you,          
      I know this castle        

209
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,453
   like the back of my hand.    

210
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,854
     Oh.                        

211
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,856
                I sneak us into 
                    the castle, 

212
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,225
                  and you blast 
            Toffee in the face. 

213
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,861
           ( malicious giggle ) 
       It's the circle of life. 

214
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,697
- What are you talking about?   
    - So what do you say?       
      Do we have a deal?        

215
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,233
I'm not gonna touch             
the hand with the mole on it.   

216
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,402
                    Fine.       

217
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,771
Actually, I don't wanna         
touch any of your skin          
with my skin.                   

218
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,239
 Don't trust him.               

219
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,308
       I will guide you.        

220
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,609
        I don't really          
      trust you either.         

221
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,178
        I am father now.        

222
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,716
I would like my children        
to grow up inside castle.       

223
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,418
You don't have                  
to trust me.                    

224
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,553
   But consider alternative.    

225
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,268
        ( muttering in          
     foreign language. )        

226
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,203
           Let's go.            

227
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,505
                   ( giggling ) 
                Out of the way. 

228
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,440
              Whoa, whoa.       

229
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,875
           Before you go inside,

230
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,844
       I must tell you,         
   Toffee is not like Ludo.     

231
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,613
      He knows about you,       

232
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,482
       and he does not          
       like your magic.         

233
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,318
                Oh, yeah? Well, 
            I don't like his... 

234
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,254
                           uh...

235
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,191
                         Uh...  

236
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,893
     You need to have plan.     

237
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,464
What did I say                  
about the pillows?              

238
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,866
I don't need pillows            
on my chair.                    

239
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,468
I'm an adult.                   

240
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,503
                     Okay.      

241
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,743
              No.               

242
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,882
         Marco! Here's the plan.

243
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,818
                 We're going in 
           on the count of one. 

244
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,453
     That is not good plan.     

245
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,354
            - One.              
      - No, wait. Stop.         

246
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:07,258
Chad, wait. Now is              
our chance to get the wand.     

247
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,993
                    ( scoffs )  

248
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,669
          You made it.          

249
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,346
Supersonic...                   
supersonic leech bomb.          

250
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,287
             What?              

251
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,660
             Oh, hey, Buff Frog.

252
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,476
                     ( yelling )

253
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,063
              No.               

254
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,391
          ( gasps )             
            Marco!              

255
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,626
           - Star!              
         - We did it!           

256
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,428
          Ha, sorry.            
     I was just excited.        

257
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:56,367
              Come on, come on, 
          let's get outta here. 

258
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,936
                  Oh, no.       

259
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,838
         ( struggling )         

260
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,573
     Stop.                      

261
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:08,346
    That's no way to treat      
     our guest of honor.        

262
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,520
           No, no, no, no!      

263
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,422
                   ( straining )

264
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,490
   Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

265
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,860
That's not going                
to work again.                  

266
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,429
        That crystal's          
     twice as strong now.       

267
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,031
                     ( buzzing )

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,868
 Don't worry, Star.             

269
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,502
       I think I got it.        

270
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,678
                  Fine. Take it.

271
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,480
               Now let Marco go.

272
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,048
          ( laughing )          

273
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,851
    Help, help, help, help!     

274
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,621
         Do you think           
        I'm like Ludo?          

275
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,689
        Just swallow it.        

276
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,632
I don't want                    
your wand.                      

277
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:01,866
          Destroy it.           

278
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,936
             What?!             

279
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,438
           Surprise!            

280
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,441
           I can't.             
    I don't even know how.      

281
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,776
          Yes, you do.          

282
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,412
     It's the first spell       
   your mother taught you.      

283
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,115
     The whispering spell.      

284
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,716
            Exactly.            

285
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,919
   Marco's waiting.             

286
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,054
             Star.              

287
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,529
           I'm sorry.           

288
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,532
         ( whispering )         

289
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,477
    ( whispering continues )    

290
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,659
   ( whispering )               

291
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,469
     - Now let Marco go.        
     - ( snaps fingers )        

292
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,513
           - Star.              
            - Run.              

293
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,650
          Whoa. Oh.             
          My babies.            

294
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,986
Okay, you really gotta          
stop shoving me.                

295
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,620
              It's not over.    

296
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,758
           Gentlemen.           

297
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,594
     It's been a pleasure.      

298
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,255
          - Lawyers.            
           - Look.              

299
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,990
            Nature.             

300
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,828
           BOTH: Eww!           

301
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,231
              Where's my castle?

302
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,700
           It's gone.           

303
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,069
                   And where is 
                     your wand? 

304
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,637
            That's gone, too.   

305
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:20,905
          Everything?           

306
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,574
   We are no longer friends!    

307
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,876
          We never were friends.

308
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:28,279
         You are now            
       my mortal enemy.         

309
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,915
       This day I vow...        

310
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,168
      ( speaking Italian )      

311
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,799
       ( loud rumbling )        

312
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,846
             Whoa!              

313
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,848
                        Upgrade.

314
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,824
Oh, Marco, I am                 
so happy to see you!            

315
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,759
              Uh, do I know you?

316
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,262
Marco, it is me.                
I am your dad.                  

317
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,097
               My dad!          

318
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,234
Ooh, ooh, my turn.              
Come here... oh... ah!          

319
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,970
I'm goin' down.                 
Just come here                  
and hug your mother.            

320
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,972
     This is so awkward,        
             Mom.               

321
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,807
It's not awkward.               
Don't make it awkward.          

322
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,743
        Wait. How did           
      you guys get here?        

323
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,745
     They used your mirror.     

324
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,681
   ( whistling ) S-s-s-so,      
          basically,            

325
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,850
        just to recap--         

326
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,386
      - You're not going        
     to do that, are you?       
       - What, my dear?         

327
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:19,123
You know that thing when        
you talk and every time you     
get to a word with an "S,"      

328
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,025
you have that little whistle    
in your front teeth.            

329
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,194
        - ( whistles )          
     - I love you, honey.       

330
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,962
         I just can't           
    deal with that today.       

331
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,797
            Star,               
    you abused your magic,      

332
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,034
frightened Mr. and Mrs. Diaz,   
   and destroyed your wand.     

333
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,836
         Did I leave            
        anything out?           

334
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,838
  Uh, well, there's a bunch     
        of other stuff          

335
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,706
   - you don't know about.      
            - Sh!               

336
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,841
         No, I think            
      that's everything.        

337
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,409
But look,                       
new wand's fine.                

338
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,812
          - Sort of.            
        - It's, uh...           

339
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:45,316
   I'll take it and get it      
       cleaned for you.         

340
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,318
 Please don't be mad.           

341
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,687
That looks like                 
a mad face.                     

342
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,693
 So you're not mad.             

343
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,828
      Oh, I'm always mad.       

344
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,397
        But I'm happy           
      that you're safe.         

345
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,732
         ( whinnying )          

346
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,201
     Um, Mr. and Mrs. Diaz,     

347
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,703
          I'm sorry             
      I made you worry.         

348
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,371
We're just glad                 
that...                         

349
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,708
everyone's okay.                
And I'm on a horse!             

350
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,411
     - ( loud whinnying )       
       - ( screaming )          

351
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,346
          MRS. DIAZ:            
     Where are you going?       

352
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,349
     MR. DIAZ: Don't you        
    ride off with my wife!      

353
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,751
       - ( shuddering )         
         - Go ahead.            

354
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,320
Mrs. Diaz,                      
wait up!                        

355
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,889
I don't know if we're           
doing the right thing, River.   

356
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,857
                        Darling.

357
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,227
       Glossarick. Hello!       

358
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,962
Stop yelling.                   

359
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,830
I was in the tub...             

360
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,131
            My lady.            

361
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,400
     - We can call back.        
       - No, it's fine.         

362
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,903
        I'm just doing          
     a little gardening.        

363
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,305
          ( gasps )             
     What happened there?       

364
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,909
We fear that the wand           
has been cleaved.               

365
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,344
            Cleaved?            

366
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:49,013
          Now that's            
        a funny word.           

367
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,148
        You can cleave          
       something apart,         

368
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,885
      or you can cleave         
     something together.        

369
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,822
        - Glossarick.           
     - If I go like this,       

370
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:01,492
      with both my arms,        
   down goes my bath towel,     

371
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,394
     cleaved from my body.      

372
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,763
            ( clearing throat ) 
                    Glossarick. 

373
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,131
                  Towel, please.

374
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,400
         No problem,            
        Your Highness.          

375
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:12,903
       I hope you found         
        all the pieces          

376
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,272
