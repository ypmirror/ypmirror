      ( clearing throat )       

20
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,324
     Okay, quiet, everyone.     

21
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,693
           Quiet!!              
             Oh.                

22
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,229
   I assume you all brought     
         your swords.           

23
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,697
          Uh... what?           

24
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:06,899
   It said on the invitation    

25
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,600
       you're supposed          
      to bring a sword.         

26
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,937
   I was a little confused      
     by your invitation.        

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,338
       I'm not confused.        

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,841
  This is clearly a drawing     
           of meat.             

29
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,943
      I came for the meat.      

30
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:21,013
      I think everyone's        
just wondering why they're here.

31
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:24,283
      Uh, it's the 37th         
         of Grovnok.            

32
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,718
     - Mewnipendence Day.       
    - ( Ferguson coughs )       

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,620
      ( frustrated groan )      

34
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,668
       Mewnipendence Day.       

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,772
Along time ago arrived the first
      settlers of Mewni.        

36
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,941
        ( boat noises )         

37
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:52,244
       A modest people          
    with noble pursuits--       

38
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,380
        life, liberty,          
          and corn.             

39
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,916
   But the wicked monsters      
     rose up and attacked       

40
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,651
      the innocent Mewnans      

41
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,620
      to re-steal Mewni         
       for themselves.          

42
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,123
         So the queen           
        used her magic          

43
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:08,093
 to turn the simple peasants    
    into a fearsome army.       

44
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,728
  And then there was fighting.  

45
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,230
     Fighting, fighting,        
     fighting, fighting.        

46
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,764
      And the Mewnans won.      

47
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,099
             Ta-da!             

48
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,401
    ( imitating fireworks       
         exploding )            

49
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,771
   Wait. But you just blew      
past all the important parts.   

50
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,808
      - When do we eat?         
 - We feast after we re-enact   

51
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,644
      the great monster         
          massacre!             

52
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,979
    Now please split into       
         two teams--            

53
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,714
     monsters and Mewnans.      

54
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,782
     - Can I be a human?        
     - You are a monster.       

55
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,417
       That's why you           
        were invited.           

56
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,919
       Why do I always          
       get picked to...         

57
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,921
    - I wanna be a Mewman.      
    - I wanna be a Mewman.      

58
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,256
       ( all chattering )       

59
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,057
        You get to be           
         my general.            

60
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,325
                   Thanks.      

61
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,127
      Lookin' pretty good.      

62
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,429
Now we can begin                
making costumes,                

63
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,233
and after that,                 
the blood battle                
can commence.                   

64
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,002
Yes, Marco.                     

65
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,837
                    What's that?

66
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,672
       Oh, that's just          
      an all-seeing eye.        

67
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,773
        It follows you          
       around all day.          

68
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,675
      It's staring at me.       

69
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,411
    Don't worry, it's just      
    to remind the monsters      

70
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:03,015
    that the royal family       
     is always watching.        

71
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,017
      It's not actually         
    watching you, though.       

72
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,020
          ( laughs )            
     That would be weird.       

73
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,688
        This is amazing!        

74
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,690
          She thinks            
   it's the all-seeing eye,     

75
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,325
         but it's not.          

76
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,460
                 It is the most 
           efficient way to spy 
               on your enemies. 

77
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,697
         ( giggling )           
     I can see her pores.       

78
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,166
         What secrets           
         lie beneath?           

79
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,135
         Ludo, Master.          

80
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,304
     Yeah, yeah, yeah...        
   ( makes kissing noises )     

81
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,872
         Look at this.          

82
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,142
    Now we can watch Star       
      wherever she goes.        

83
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,844
       In the kitchen,          
bedroom, even in the bathroom.  

84
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,713
                      Uh... sir?

85
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,081
Maybe we don't                  
keep the bathroom channel.      

86
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,750
      But Ludo, this eye        
      only has one eye.         

87
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,185
                My face has two.

88
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,754
   That's twice the number      
         of the eyes.           

89
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,823
Now that you don't have         
any spy stuff to do,            

90
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,825
you should get us               
some popcorn and milkshakes.    

91
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,128
I'm pretty sure we're gonna     
binge-watch this baby           
all night.                      

92
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,863
 You can join us if you want,   

93
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,266
as long as you keep quiet       
and sit in the back.            

94
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,338
    She doesn't even know       
     we're watching her.        

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,841
Sometimes your biggest threat   
  is right under your nose.     

96
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,743
 My nose is in my beak.         

97
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,345
                    Mm-hmm.     

98
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,218
                  ( straining ) 
                         There. 

99
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,889
  That'll keep your entrails    
from becoming your out-trails.  

100
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,927
     My pillow.                 

101
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,397
     Hey, Star, I've been       
   looking through your...      

102
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,099
            Hold on.            

103
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,800
      I've been looking         
      through your book,        

104
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,069
      and, uh, something        
          seems off.            

105
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,138
      What do you mean?         
         Let me see.            

106
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,116
     Oh, okay.                  

107
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,086
   Wow, you're right, Marco.    

108
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,122
       I can't believe          
 I didn't notice that before.   

109
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,525
      Sharper, sharper,         
          stabbier,             

110
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,328
    and you need to be on       
         a Warnicorn.           

111
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,099
   And now, for the monsters.   

112
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,837
      Hey, what do we get?      

113
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,839
   Hello. You're monsters.      
       Use your claws.          

114
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,574
                    ( growling )

115
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,353
  Star, I know the monsters     
       are bad and all,         

116
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:24,423
          but this seems unfair.

117
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,158
            Unfair?             

118
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,597
        Do something.           
    He's writhing in pain.      

119
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,534
       Oh, never mind.          
         He stopped.            

120
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,102
                            Mom.

121
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,470
      Owie.                     

122
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,473
   Comrades, it's beginning.    

123
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:45,977
      Toffee replaced me        
     with electronic eye.       

124
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,113
     - Uh, we don't care.       
      - But you should.         

125
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,449
Pretty soon,                    
Toffee will replace you         

126
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,384
with electronic                 
ice cream cone,                 

127
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,354
           and you with another 
     electronic ice cream cone. 

128
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,988
                 And you with...

129
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,990
      What is it you do         
           exactly?             

130
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:04,896
Um, there's two of us,          
so... maybe that's a thing.     

131
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,898
               Are you finished?

132
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,534
Gentlemen, allow me to direct   
        your attention          

133
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,069
          to our new            
     surveillance device.       

134
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,038
      Princess Butterfly        
        is re-enacting          

135
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,873
     our favorite holiday,      

136
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,341
  the great monster massacre.   

137
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,577
              My least favorite 
                       holiday. 

138
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,413
   Don't worry, we can take     
advantage of this opportunity.  

139
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,087
       Why send an army         
        after the wand          

140
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,324
        when it can be          
       hand delivered?          

141
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,026
          ( gasps )             
Oh, isn't that a thing thing?   

142
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,496
      And it's not like         
    she's going to notice       

143
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,164
        a real monster.         

144
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,266
 Those aren't real?             

145
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,235
                    Okay.       

146
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,538
   Now, who'd like to bring     
        Ludo his wand?          

147
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,674
        ( all mumbling )        

148
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,243
                      I will go.

149
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,979
     I thought you might,       
   you fat bag of garbage.      

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,195
       - I'm so sorry,          
          Ferguson.             
          - Come on!            

151
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,235
                     Hey, Star, 
                   everything's 
                        set up. 

152
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,604
              We'll get started 
              whenever you give 
                    the signal. 

153
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,673
             Or not, and we can 
                   just go eat. 

154
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,508
   No, it's okay.               

155
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,310
  It'll be fun.                 

156
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,078
                           Okay.

157
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,416
                     Here we go.

158
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,251
       Knights of Mewni,        

159
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,120
         Take up your           
       stabby weapons,          

160
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:39,090
        and drive out           
      the evil monsters!        

161
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,463
           ALL: Wow!            

162
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,231
        ( battle cries )        

163
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,271
        I can't do this.        

164
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,173
       Make me invisible.       

165
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,384
       - I'm so sorry,          
          Ferguson.             
          - Come on!            

166
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,064
           Careful.             
       What a massacre.         

167
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,078
           Please don't hurt me.

168
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,114
                   ( laughs )   

169
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,163
         ( stammering )         

170
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,265
( gasping )                     

171
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,406
       What is he doing?        

172
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,209
Ferguson?                       

173
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,049
           Ferguson!            

174
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,122
         I am so sorry.         

175
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,257
       Marco was right,         
       this is unfair.          

176
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,359
    Ferguson, are you okay?     

177
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,763
I'm fine.                       
I'm just invisible.             

178
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,246
            All right, let's go 
                 eat some corn. 

179
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,150
                 ALFONZO: Yeah, 
             I need to sit down 
                for a few days. 

180
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,253
       What a disgrace.         
     This is what you get       

181
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,221
     when you hire people       
       from the swamp.          

182
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,123
              Let's watch again.

183
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,131
       I'm telling you,         
         this thing,            

184
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,233
        it didn't work.         

185
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,605
   - It works fine for me.      
      - He sabotaged it.        

186
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,406
      I rescued you from        
     a life in the swamp.       

187
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,475
                 I took you in, 
              I gave you pants, 

188
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,411
               and this is what 
             you do to repay... 
                 wait a minute. 

189
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,246
           Where are your pants?

190
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,414
          Uh, well...           

191
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,816
         Oh, get real!          

192
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,185
     You've brought shame       
        on this house.          

193
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,454
      Now go to your room.      

194
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,156
   I don't know what to do      
       about that one.          

195
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,592
      Should I take away        
  his milkshake privileges?     

196
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,295
            Seriously? This was 
                   idiot-proof. 

197
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,297
               I think you know 
           what you have to do. 

198
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,865
   Uh...                        

199
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:40,171
         No, wait. No!          

200
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,241
        Well, that was          
       pretty hardcore.         

201
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,410
                   You did what 
                had to be done. 

202
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,213
         ( chattering )         

203
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,149
       Um, are you sure         
      this is accurate?         

204
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,817
 You know what?                 

205
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,719
I think it's time               
we just put the book away.      

206
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,354
                           Okay.

207
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,174
              No.               

208
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,510
             Nope.              

209
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,879
      Reading in the tub        
          is not...             

210
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,885
     a sure-fire fun way        
   to spice up a dull day.      

211
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,720
              Hmm.              

212
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,256
    Today might be the day      
   I face my biggest fear.      

213
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,324
            Boredom.            

214
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,795
    Maybe today's the day       
      I renounce my vow         

215
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,264
   to never have a dull day.    

216
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,802
      Today I will look         
     boredom in its eyes,       

217
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,204
      those beady little        
         black eyes,            

218
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,972
       like tiny little         
         black fists.           

219
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:51,342
  I'll look into those eyes     
      and I will say...         

220
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,478
    Oh, wait, never mind.       
       What's this? Oh!         

221
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,380
       The banagic wand.        

222
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,349
       Earth's coolest          
        magical treat.          

223
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,518
          ( gasps )             
         Earth magic!           

224
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
   I swear to baby dolphin      
           giggles,             

225
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,656
         I will find            
       the banagic wand         

226
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,558
   before this day is done...   

227
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,359
         or die trying.         

228
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,429
       Or my name's not         
       Star Butterfly.          

229
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,431
      As me as my witness,      

230
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,267
   I'll never go bored again!   

231
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,703
      And anything else         
     I'm supposed to say        

232
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,271
     to make this official.     

233
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,273
                       Whoo-hoo!

234
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,775
                   I don't know 
               where I'm going. 

235
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,276
             Hmmm.              

236
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,612
    Ah, "as featured on TV."    

237
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,248
       But I saw it in          
        this magazine.          

238
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,517
           Mmm. Aha!            

239
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,586
          A riddle.             
          ( laughs )            

240
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,722
 But I'm terrible at riddles.   
         Need Marco.            

241
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:41,292
      ( inhaling deeply )       

242
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,297
           - Marco!             
            - Ah!               

243
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,334
     - Earth magic. Look.       
    - That thing from TV?       

244
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,835
( gasps )                       
You've seen it?                 

245
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,371
   Yeah. It's one of those      
   late night commercials.      

246
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,574
So it does exist.               
To the TV!                      

247
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,511
   I can't. I've gotta get      
     to my karate class.

  - Marco, we're not moving.

You push these little thingies  
       with your feet.          

282
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,467
               Honestly, Marco, 
             sometimes I wonder 

283
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,870
       if you have a firm grasp 
           on this Earth stuff. 

284
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,572
        Oh, too slow.           
     Bunny Rocket Blast!        

285
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,412

286
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,414
                Marco, we don't 
         have time for detours. 

287
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,850
            The commercial said 
               we have to hurry 

288
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,486
     while supplies last.       
     Focus on the quest.        

289
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,555
 This is where I'm going.       

290
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,956
  Karate.                       

291
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,124
 I am not going with you.       

292
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,994
       Dear, sweet Marco.       

293
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:59,030
 I commend him for making it    
   this far on the journey,     

294
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,567
     and vow to complete        
   the quest in his honor.      

295
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,535
          Good-bye, sweet Marco.

296
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,484
     The store is guarded       
        by a werewolf.          

297
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,120
I wish you no harm,             
werewolf.                       

298
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,056
All I seek                      
is the banagic wand.            

299
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,558
    Is this a better store?     

300
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,460
           Uh, better than what?

301
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,696
     ( frustrated groan )       
        More riddles.           

302
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,698
         I wish Marco           
      was still with us.        

303
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,569
  You must learn to channel     
   what is deep inside you.     

304
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,971
          Diaz, name an emotion.

305
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,973
        - Uh, hunger.           
 - Channel your hunger, Diaz.   

306
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:46,511
    Channel your emotions       
to brave the gauntlet of fire!  

307
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,549
    Wait, we're gonna walk      
          on those?             

308
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,751

    - Uh, that one's okay.      

310
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,557
  but there's a better store    
 down on Main and Riverside.    

311
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,492
    A better store near me.     

312
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,595
    There's a better store      
    on Main and Riverside?      

313
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,765
           - Yeah.              
         - Whoo-hoo!            

314
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,001
         Which way is           
     Main and Riverside?        

315
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,569
 Aha!                           

316
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,173
        Diaz, approach.         

317
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,257
                 Classic Marco. 
             Writhing in agony. 

318
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,625
           ( growls )           

319
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,595
   Okay, I'm on Main Street.    

320
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,864
                  Now, where is 
                     Riverside? 

321
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,634
          ( gasps )             
    A river and its side.       

322
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,169
          I found it!           

323
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,271
            Like I knew I would.

324
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,777
   Ahoy, matey.                 

325
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,149
          - Pirates.            
   - That's what we arrgh.      

326
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,619
Now come with me                
to Davey Jones' fish locker.    

327
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,855
         Okay, pirate.          

328
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,656
             I am at your mercy,

329
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:08,693
                   for I am but 
        your helpless prisoner. 

330
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,829
   Not true. I'm a powerful     
princess from another dimension,

331
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,065
     and I'm gonna get us       
       all out of here.         

332
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,067
        Freedom is nigh!        

333
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,604
Arrgh, ma'am?                   

334
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,676
      Surrender, pirates.       

335
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,581
              Huh?              

336
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,651
        Stay back, you          
    bloodthirsty savages.       

337
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,554
       - Tiara Tornado!         
          - Enough!             

338
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,591
Do you surrender, pirate?       

339
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,859
              We aren't pirates.

340
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,563
   This is a pirate-themed      
         restaurant.            

341
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,566
          ( nervous giggle )    

342
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,835
      Do you know where         
  I can find a better store?    

343
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,837
         ( screaming )          

344
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,016
        A better store.         

345
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,617
 MAN: There she is!             

346
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,621
             Can I borrow this? 
                Thanks so much. 

347
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,589
                        Bye.    

348
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,624
      My baby's in there.       

349
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,660
      Oh, no, there he is.      

350
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,931
        ( all yelling )         

351
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,733
           Oh, no!              
    Starlight Foot Smash!       

352
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,339
   Miranda, I swear, if you     
wear fuzzy boots to my party,   

353
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,808
         I will break           
        your feet off.          

354
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,610
          What the...           

355
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,312
Brittany, you've gotta help me. 

356
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,947
There's an angry mob            
after me.                       

357
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,248
Could you throw 'em             
off my trail?                   

358
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,317
       Tell them I went         
    that way? Thanks. Bye!      

359
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,687
              She went in there.

360
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,657
       And here we have         
          Marco Diaz            

361
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,292
         approaching            
    the gauntlet of fire.       

362
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,795
  It's been a tough 14 years    
          for Diaz.             

363
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,799
  No girlfriend, can't seem     
   to get past green belt.      

364
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,336
That history of failure must be 
  suffocating him right now.    

365
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,637
    Jeremy, get out of here!    

366
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,806
I'm trying to channel           
my emotions.                    

367
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,141
               ( camera clicks )

368
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,247
               Fail, fail, fail.

369
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,215
            Enough!!            

370
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,702
You little twerp.               

371
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,838
                     Diaz, wait!

372
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,673
            - Huh?              
        - You did it!           

373
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,246
          ( laughs )            
          I did it.             

374
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,748
I understand now, sensei.       

375
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,183
                           Diaz.

376
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,084
   - This was all a part...     
           - Diaz.              

377
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,253
   - You had Jeremy act...      
           - Diaz!              

378
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,756
               Foot fire, buddy.

aren't they?                    

381
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,801
     You! Time to pay for       
      what you've done.         

382
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,737
 Are they talking to you?       

383
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,707
                   Mm-hmm.      

384
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,245
        Wreck my store?         

385
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,214
 I'll show you.
