00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,395
You got some paint or something.
Right here.                     

26
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,667
       Marco, this is not paint.

00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,003
Well, looks like                
you got another heart.

00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,771
                  Quiet, Marco. 
               This is serious! 

29
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:16,675
      I think I'm going through 
                      mewberty.

 Weeellll, okay.

00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,981
 Uh, mewberty. Heh heh.         

33
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,716
That's nothing                  
to be ashamed of.               

34
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,652
We have a similar thing         
here on Earth.                  

35
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,687
        Don't confuse this with 
      your Earth things, Marco! 

36
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,189
            I'm from Mewni!

00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,691
             (whispers) This is 
        gonna get really weird. 

38
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,259
           You gotta keep me    
           away from boys!      

39
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:38,130
       Wait a second--          
        Marco's a boy.          

40
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,665
      ( nervous chuckle )       

41
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,333
     When you say things        
     are gonna get weird,       

42
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,669
  do you mean typical Star weird

43
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:46,338
                      or, like, 
      destroy-the-school weird? 

44
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,207
      Destroy-the-school.       

45
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,942
            That's what I was   
            worried about.      

46
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,176
             Let's get you home.

47
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,814
 Oh no, oh no, oh no.           

48
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,618
Okay, here comes a boy.         
You got this. You got this.     

49
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,821
       Avert your eyes.         
       Avert your eyes.         

50
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:07,359
Marco, I don't think            
this is such a good ideaaahhh...

51
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,297
   Hmm. Huh?                    

52
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,133
           My turn.             
            Whoa.               

53
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,334
              Okay, let's go.   

54
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:20,639
            BOTH:               
        Whooooaaahhhh!          

55
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,878
                  I'm stuck.    

56
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,013
       Um, let me help.         
             No!                

57
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,215
          Your little boy hands 
       are part of the problem! 

58
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,784
     Isn't there some way       
         I can help?            

59
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,654
   Maybe there's something      
    in your book of spells      
     that can stop this.        

60
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,756
         STAR: Maybe.           
   I'll go home and get it.     

61
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,325
              It's not at home! 
         I gave it to Ferguson! 

62
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,327
             Why?               
     I lost a bet, okay?        

63
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,163
  Do you want to help me or not?

64
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,132
Okay, but we gotta talk about   
  that betting thing later.     

65
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,067

67
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,080
Ferg!                           
I need Star's                   
book of spells.                 

68
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,849
        <i> Lo siento, Señor Marco.</i>

70
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,021

71
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:13,392
         <i> No no no. </i>            
<i>Se pronuncia "libro." Libro.</i>    

72
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,361
Where is Star's <i> libro?</i>         

73
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,729

75
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,702
You gave it to Janna?!          
Ohh!                            

76
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,304
                 <i> De nada.</i>      

77
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,846
      Ohh. That's better.

82
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,730
   Huh. That wasn't so bad.     
    MAN: All right, boys,       

83
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,832
  we're gonna do our warm-up    
       out here today.          

84
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,834
    Pool's been compromised.

       Poop. It was poop.       

86
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,572

 Awesome! What is it?

 my parents to stop fighting?   
           Totally.

      all over for this!        

100
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,904
      Now that you found        
      your little book,         

101
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,906
          let's make some magic 
                       with it. 

102
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,441
 I don't need your help, Jenna!

            'cause I got        
            your house keys.    

106
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,849
   Arggh. Gotta stay focused.

       make any sense!          

109
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,187
    Isn't there a glossary      
        in this thing?          

110
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,492
     Did someone say Glossaryck?

111
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,894
             Wha?               
      'Cause that's me.

           Of Terms.            

114
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,567
    At your service, milady.    

115
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,002
Uh, I'm not a milady.           

116
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,539

          Ha ha ha!             
          Ah, Star Butterfly.   

121
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,851
     What's wrong with her?     

122
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,987
 She says she's got mewberty.   

123
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,489
       I usually don't

          How do I make it stop?

150
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,108
      Well, can't stop it.      

151
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,342
        That's not an option.

      It'll be over soon.

           Ahhh...              
         It's empty.            
       You ate it all.

161

 That is all.

            Come on!            

345
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,741
   Guards! Seize them!          

346
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:01,986
          I've never met anyone 
           with such beautiful, 
             soft, excess skin. 

347
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,921
 ( laughing ) Oh, yes!          

348
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,924
      I try not to move         
       around too much.         

349
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:11,996
         ( screaming )          

350
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,635
         ( screaming )          

351
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,880
                Hey! You should 
      watch where you're going! 

352
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,548
  You watch                     
  where <i> you're </i> going!         

353
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,254
          ALL: Uhh!             
         ( all gasp )           

354
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,190
     ( chain saw buzzing )      

355
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,160
          Hey! I was just about 
       to come rescue you guys! 

356
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,628
      Ferguson!                 

357
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,329
   I was so worried!            

358
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,665
         Yeah, turns out        
         they worship me here.  

359
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,034
          <i> And </i> check out       
           my new girlfriend.   

360
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,303
     That's right, I did,       
     I said "girlfriend."       

361
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,573
   He calls me Sugar Wings.     
         ( giggles )            

362
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,676
            I am so happy       
            you guys are here.  

363
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,945
            You're just in time 
                for my wedding! 

364
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:04,282
    ( Wedding March plays )     

365
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:09,320
              Are you two ready 
     to swear your undying love 
                for each other? 

366
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,923
MARCO: Don't!                   
This is crazy!                  

367
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,691
Ferguson, think about this!     

368
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,927
You're not ready                
for this kind of commitment!    

369
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,695
You're only fourteen!           

370
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,231
You still paint a face          
on your stomach                 
and make it talk!               

371
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,936
        He has a point.         

372
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,372
     Empress, you're an amazing 
              flying Pixie lady 

373
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,374
         and you're really cool.

374
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,944
     but I didn't really        
     think this through.        

375
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,882
          I'm sorry.            
          I can't marry you.    

376
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,285
              Hmm.              

377
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,354
     Guards, kill them all.     

378
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,293
             Aaaah!             

379
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,630
       Aayyahh!                 

380
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,634
            Aaaaah!             

381
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,112
 Fly free, little Ferg!         

382
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,683
 And I am saving <i> you </i>          
 for later.                     

383
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,087
                Yaahh! Yaahh!   

384
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,758
    Winter Storm Hyperblow!     

385
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,701
   Let's go!                    

386
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,204
    EMPRESS: No! I haven't      
       killed you yet!          

387
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,106
             Rainbow Fly Trap!  

388
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,013
   I still think you're cool!   

389
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,683
 Ohh. He was out of my league   
           anyway.              

390
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,252
   That's it. I'm switching     
      service providers.        

391
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,154
 Yeah, good call.               

392
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,090
       Star, I feel bad.        

393
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,727
      I think I may have ruined 
 Ferguson's one chance at love. 

394
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,197
 Maybe we <i> are </i> mess-up twins.  

395
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:03,701
    Oh, Marco. That Pixie       
    didn't love Ferguson.       

396
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,469
     She just wanted to eat him.

397
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,471
     Really?                    

398
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:11,209
           And let's be honest, 
                  Ferguson does 
               look <i> delicious.</i> 

399
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,710
         ( both laugh )         

400
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,845
  Yeah, I guess                 
  nobody's perfect.             

401
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,882
           Uh, why are you guys 
               talking about me 
             like I'm not here? 

402
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,318
            And where's Alfonzo?

403
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,787
  You may now kiss the bride.   

404
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,356
      ( spectators cheer )      

405
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:29,060
               Yay! I will make 
            a great Pixie king! 

406
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,763
       I'll be very tyrannical. 
                           Hmm?
