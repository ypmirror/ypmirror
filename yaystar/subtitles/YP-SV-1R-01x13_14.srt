00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,043
             Ahh!               
            Wahhh!              

207
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,348
         ( exploding )          

208
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:16,154
      ( grizzly voice )         
       What's happening         
            to me?              

209
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:22,127
          ( growling )          

210
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,564
 Oh, not again!                 

211
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:30,602
       Being bad feels          
           so good.             

212
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:31,603
     How could you do this?     

213
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,738
                   I was trying 
                   to help you! 

214
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,474
          ( growling )          

215
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,109
             Whoa.              

216
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,680
Don't listen to her.            
She's the enemy!                

217
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:45,383
             No, I saw the good 
           in you! Don't do it! 

218
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,821
Act like a monster              
and give it to me!              

219
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,124
          Lobster claws, please!

220
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,393
          ( growling )          

221
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,565
         ( snarling )           
          Hii...yah!            

222
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,840
Ahh!                            
I always forget                 
about that karate boy!          

223
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:12,711
           Stardust             
      Daisy Devastation!        

224
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,848
          ( coughing )          

225
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,185
            Retreat!            

226
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,188
        Wh-wh-wh-whoa.          
             You.               

227
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,692
       You had the wand         
  in the palm of your claws!    

228
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,762
    What did it feel like?      
     It kind of tingled.        

229
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,799
                     I knew it! 
                I'm so jealous. 
        Can I touch your claws? 

230
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,736
                    ( gushing ) 
                          Nice! 

231
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,138
                    After you.  

232
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,473
Don't do it, lobster claws!     

233
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,508
What about wanting              
to be good?                     

234
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,678
                          LUDO: 
             That's my monster! 

235
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,780
   Ahh. Marco.                  
   You were right.              

236
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,416
     There was some good        
      in him, after all.        

237
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,586
  Not much.                     

238
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,893
           ( yawns )            

239
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,629
         ( squawks )            
            Wha--?              

240
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,931
       ( all squawking )        

241
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,601
             Huh?               
      ( jungle noises )         

242
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,771
     Wow, Star's getting        
     better at her magic.       

243
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,572
    This is really peaceful.    

244
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,807
     ( creature roaring )       
            Ahh!!               

245
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,909
          Help! Ahh!            
    ( creature growling )       

246
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,679
        Mega Explosive          
        Crystal Laser!          

247
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:23,815
         ( screeching           
         like a cat )           

248
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:24,949
 Here, kitty kitty.             

249
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,386
                    ( gasping ) 
          Thanks for saving me. 

250
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,756
           Again, that makes it 
              28 saves for you, 

251
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:36,761
       and four for me,         
      but... ( laughs )         
       Who's counting?          

252
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:42,267
Wow, Marco.                     
I just love what                
you've done with the place.     

253
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,401
( squawking )                   

254
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,770
 Aw, so cute.                   

255
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,906
         ( laughing )           
   What? I didn't do this.      

256
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,842
     Well, somebody did.        
          Somebody?             

257
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,379
      Birds and rainbows and... 
              whatever that is. 

258
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,414
            'Sup?               
     This has to be you.        

259
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,284
    Sorry, it wasn't me.        

260
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,021
Eh, looks more                  
like your dad's work.           

261
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,989
       This was my work.        

262
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,993
                   Ha ha ha ha! 
      But the rest of this, no. 

263
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,299
            MARCO:              
         ( snoring )            

264
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,635
             Huh?!              

265
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,611
         ( gasping )            
   ( shooting off lasers )      

266
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,246
           N-N-N-No.            

267
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,314
         ( gibberish )          

268
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,449
           ( yelps )            

269
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,318
            Star?               
     What are you doing?        

270
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
  ( hissing gibberish )         

271
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,425
       Ahhh! Okay. Oh,          
          whoa whoa.            
       AUTOMATED VOICE:         
      Playing messages.         

272
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:45,764
      Star. Just calling        
   with your daily reminder     
  to behave like the queen-     
  in-training that you are.     

273
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,732
        Paper. Tornado.         

274
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,301
            What?               
        ( screaming )           

275
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,903
          Ow. Star!             
           Wake up!             

276
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:56,407
      Beanbag. Monster.         
        Metamorphosis.          

277
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,642
          ( growling )          

278
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,444
         ( roaring )            
         ( yelling )            

279
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,445
             Star!              

280
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,813
          ( yawning )           

281
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,681
        Morning, Marco.         

282
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,683
           Morning,             
    beanbag chair monster.      

283
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,686
               Marco! Lightning 
                 to the rescue! 

284
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,489
Ahh! Ughh.                      
( sighs )                       

285
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,291
( heavy sigh )                  
You saved me.                   

286
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,362
 That's, uh, 29 to 4.           

287
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:20,965
         ( snoring )            
        What happened?          

288
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,334
      You were spelling         
        in your sleep!          

289
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,403
     ( battle cry )             

290
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,740
That must be why                
you don't remember turning      
our living room into a jungle.  

291
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,309
      Oh, no, you gotta fix me, 
                          Diaz. 

292
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,879
( inhaling )                    
Now's my chance                 
to save you.                    

293
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,315
 With psychology!               

294
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,650
          Psychology?           

295
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:44,956
         Psychology.            
            Yeah.               
         Psychology.            

296
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,424
                     What is it?

297
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,993
Psychology is like karate       
for your mind.                  

298
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,564
I'm gonna dig deep              
in your brain to see            
what makes you tick.            

299
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:56,668
      Ohh. Yeah, we have        
something like that on Mewni.   

300
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,902
         ( screaming )          

301
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:01,039
Yeah, this                      
is pretty different.            

302
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,874
Now, before we start,           

303
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,643
   I must transform myself.     
          Transform?            

304
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,513
Ahhh.                           
Glasses. Paper.                 

305
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,650
Clothes. Book.                  
Dr. Marco, Ph.D.                

306
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,853
      What does Ph.D. stand for?

307
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,621
Pretty handsome dude.           

308
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,023
      Mom! Go back to bed.      

309
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,526
          All right,            
       Miss Butterfly.          

310
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:26,698
I'm going to administer         
a series of psychological tests 
to uncover what's bothering you.

311
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,500
Oooh. Tests.                    
Sounds fun!                     

312
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,602
 Oh, wait, no it doesn't.       

313
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,837
Test number one.                
Role playing.                   

314
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,840
I want you to pretend           
to be someone close to you.     

315
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,644
        Hi, I'm Marco.          
 My skinny jeans are awesome!   

316
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,880
       Ooh, here comes          
      Jacquelyn Thomas!         

317
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,115
    I'm gonna impress her       
       with my karate.          

318
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,516
       I got this cute          
         little mole.           

319
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,885
     ( exasperated sigh )       

320
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,488
Test number two.                
Art therapy.                    

321
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,124
      Paint me a picture        
      of your childhood.        

322
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,662
Mmmm. Such depth.               
So many symbols.                

323
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,898
What does it say                
about your childhood?           

324
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,634
      I was just drawing        
    unicorns and monsters       
     'cause they're cool.       

325
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:05,570
       Rawr! Egh! Rawr!         
         Test three!            

326
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,905
         Ink blot test.         

327
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,840
           Tell me what you see 
                 on this paper. 

328
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,508
An ink blot!                    
I win!                          

329
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,745
       Okay, no no no.          
        What does this          
        remind you of?          

330
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,879
 A fat porcupine.               

331
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,681
           Oh, yes,             
         that's good.           

332
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,584
     What about this one?       
      A little alien guy        
       in a gnome cap.          

333
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:24,422
( gasps )                       
Maybe I'm sleep-spelling        
because I'm secretly a little   
alien guy in a gnome cap.       

334
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:29,093
     No. Now what about--       
     ugh, wait. Hold on,        
      this is a mistake.        
          ( gasps )             

335
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,529
       That reminds me          
   of my overbearing mother     
        suffocating me          

336
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,532
     with all the duties        
     of becoming a queen        
   for the rest of my life.     

337
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,770
  I think we may have found     
  the root of your problem.     

338
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,772
    You have mother issues!     

339
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,007
 Yay! I have Mother Issues.     

340
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,511
       No, that's bad.          
             Aww.               
    I have mother issues.       

341
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:50,448
               It's okay, Star. 
        Identifying the problem 
 is the first step to recovery. 

342
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,717
  Recovery.                     

343
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,121
           ( yelps )            

344
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,993
          ( snoring )           

345
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,065
           Aw, man.             
       STAR: <i> Get away!</i>         

346
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,033
         ( grunting )           
             Huh?               

347
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,601
( yawning )                     

348
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:14,605
Wait. What the--?               
Ahh! Oof. Ahh!                  

349
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,507
         Undy pants?            
           Oh, no.              

350
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,475
         Marco's naked.         

351
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,010
No,                             
I'm in my jam jams.             

352
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,912
Look.                           

353
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,146
I want your face!               

354
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,082
       Ugh, you weren't         
       sleep-spelling,          

355
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,516
        you were just           
      defending yourself        

356
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,186
         against that           
    sleep-goblin-elephant.      

357
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,221
          Wow! I'm hardcore.    

358
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,823
I came here                     
for your face!                  

359
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,758
To steal your face!             

360
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,226
You hurt me                     
in my butt!                     

361
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,729
        ( shuddering )          
             Ew.                

362
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,697
         Could you...           
        stop yelling?           

363
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:43,835
Well, I'm sorry.                
I don't have any ears.          

364
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,537
Camera phone.                   
( clicks )                      

365
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,873
I'm on the run                  
from St. O's.                   

366
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,241
      Well, you can't stay here.

367
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,843
                   I don't want 
              to go to St. O's! 

368
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,878
Oh, you're going                
to St. O's.                     

369
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,247
You see,                        
we're both big girls.           

370
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,716
We got the same                 
highs and lows,                 

371
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:02,353
the same east and west.         
You can hardly tell us apart.   

372
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,322
Except for                      
in the face.                    

373
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,224
Camera phone.                   

374
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:10,061
So I'm gonna laser finger       
your face off of your head.     

375
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,929
Oh, you can have my face.       

376
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,564
See, I'm gonna wear             
your face                       

377
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,267
and then you can go to jail.    
'Cause you look like me.        

378
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,638
It's just a classic             
face-switch scenario.           

379
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,076
         ( guffawing )          

380
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,279
                      Oh, yeah. 
      Oh, that is the stupidest 
         thing I've ever heard. 

381
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,247
 It is not funny.               

382
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,315
         ( screams )            
            Star!               

383
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,718
             Don't worry, Star. 
                 I'll save you! 

384
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,789
  Whoaaa! Ughh.                 

385
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,997
                      Ahem.     

386
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,131
   ( laughs nervously )         

387
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,804
    Camera phone.               

388
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,074
             Ahhh!              

389
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,842
   Nose grab.                   

390
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,649
        ( evil laugh )          
         MARCO: Stop!           

391
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,285
           Whoaaa.              
            Ahhh.               
   Be careful on this roof.     

392
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,954
It is slippery                  
from the evening dew.           

393
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,689
                     Let me go, 
             you weirdy weirdo! 

394
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,357
  Is Marco small?               

395
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,760
Or is he just really            
far away? I can't tell.         

396
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,328
Laser finger.                   

397
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,763
        ( screaming )           
            Marco!              

398
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:19,764
                Nooo!           

399
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,833
         ( grunting )           
         Whoa. Unhh.            

400
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,803
                Glasses. Paper. 
                       Clothes. 

401
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:29,107
          Book. Dr. Marco, Ph.D.

402
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,241
                 You don't have 
                    to do this. 

403
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,043
        I have an 'A'           
        in psychology.          

404
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,644
                 I can help you.

405
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,613
 No, thank you.                 

406
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,815
     Use your mind karate!      

407
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,250
           Listen to me.        

408
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,919
I already told you.             
I don't have any ears.          

409
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:45,723
         Well, maybe that's why 
           you're in this mess. 

410
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:50,294
        ( sad music )           
    Okay, I do have ears.       
     But I don't use them       

411
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,130
 to listen to people.           

412
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,733
The only people                 
I listen to is my mind.         

413
00:18:55,735 --> 00:19:00,905
And right now,                  
my mind is telling me           
to steal her face.              

414
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:03,174
             But you can't keep 
    running from your problems. 

415
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,276
                 When you steal 
          other people's faces, 

416
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,180
              all you're really 
       stealing is your future. 

417
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,016
But I like my future.           

418
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,657
I don't like my future.         
Camera phone.                   

419
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,325
    ( laughing )                

420
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,800
          ( growling )          

421
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,170
  ( screaming )                 
  Ahhh!                         

422
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,777
Wow, Marco.                     
You really saved my face.       

423
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,280
                           Yes! 
                       Finally. 

424
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:47,351
I don't get it.                 
Why is this tally thing         
such a big deal to you?         

425
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,087
            Uhhh...I don't know.

426
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:54,258
              I guess... you're 
            this magic princess 
         from another dimension 

427
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,096
       and I'm just...          
      ( clears throat )         

428
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:03,234
Star, Ph.D. Marco,              
you are awesome.                

429
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:06,170
We don't need to get            
caught up in who saves who.     

430
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:10,007
All that matters                
is that we have                 
each other's back.              

431
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,909
                          Yeah. 
                 But this time, 

432
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,378
           I totally saved you. 
                        Woohoo! 

433
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,280
                       Whoa.    

434
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,317
                  You're right. 
              We shouldn't keep 
                 track anymore.
