      Oh. Hello, children.      

20
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,658
                   Uh... hey.   

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,729
     You should be at home      
     with the door locked.      

22
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,765
     We're here for your...     
   to see your haunted house.   

23
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:11,737
          But this is           
the most dangerous place to be. 

24
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,006
   ( sniffs )                   

25
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:17,743
          Well, then,           
         step inside...         

26
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,712
         at your peril.         

27
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,015
                 Is this a joke?

28
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,583
    Just remember our deal.     

29
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:29,855
        Perhaps you are         
     more brave than smart.     

30
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:33,792
       Or perhaps you are       
         just like me.          

31
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:38,230
Perhaps you, too,               
have sympathy for the monster.  

32
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,565
            Oh, boy.            

33
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:40,966
          But beware.           

34
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,734
           ( gasps )            

35
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,737
           Do not do            
       what I have done.        

36
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:50,309
         You must never         
    let the monster inside.     

37
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,415
    ( mechanical grunting )     

38
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,250
        I can't do this.        

39
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,220
        Can you turn on         
      the lights, please?       

40
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:04,323
    Look, man, you seem like    
          a nice guy,           

41
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,959
                and I wanna     
                 be scared,     

42
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,094
                 I really do.   

43
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,430
       But the truth is,        
           I'm eight.           

44
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:15,667
    That's like 90 years old    
      in Halloween years.       

45
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,836
  Next year, we might not even  
     be afraid of monsters.     

46
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,605
         I don't wanna          
         waste my time.         

47
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,240
           I'm sorry.           

48
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,242
     You're just not scary.     

49
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,511
         I'm not scary?         

50
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,480
Come on, guys.                  
Let's go to a real              
haunted house.                  

51
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,682
        We had a deal, remember?

52
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,651
          ( grunting )          

53
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,486
    Okay. Halloween is over.    

54
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,688
            Janna and Star      
            need to go home now.

55
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,259
     Dad, Star lives here.      

56
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,094
           ( laughs )           
          Yes, Marco.           

57
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,263
   It doesn't always            
have to be an argument.         

58
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,632
   Sometimes we just            
  do what Daddy says.           

59
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,467
    ( straining )               

60
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,869
    Now if anybody needs me,    
      I'll be in the shed.      

61
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,705
         ( struggling )         

62
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,844
    He does this every year,    
  and it makes him miserable.   

63
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,379
    Okay, so what do we do?     

64
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,847
         Oh, I got it.          

65
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,448
  Let's go to that other house  
        down the street         

66
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,783
    and just ditch this one.    

67
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,885
           What? No.            

68
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,554
         You're missing         
           the point.           

69
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,489
    How do we make my dad's     
      haunted house scary?      

70
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:11,857
            We can always summon
            Hungry Larry.       

71
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,525
           Uh... who?           

72
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,327
       Oh, Hungry Larry.        

73
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,462
   You know, you summon him,    
he comes and haunts your house. 

74
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,331
   I hear he's a real creep.    

75
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,302
     We're not summoning...     

76
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,970
            anyone.             

77
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,705
  We're not summoning... ugh!   

78
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,740
 I can't believe I even have to 
have this conversation with you.

79
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,242
      Where are you going?      

80
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,977
       I'm gonna go bribe       
      some five-year-olds.      

81
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,347
      Maybe they'll think       
        my dad's scary.         

82
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,849
         No summoning.          

83
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,720
Okay, it says here,             
"If Hungry Larry is             
the haunt you need,             

84
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,689
do these actions                
and you'll succeed.             

85
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,324
       A lick of mustard        
         you must bear,         

86
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,526
    off an old takeout menu     
         if you dare."          

87
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,861
                      All right.
                      Done.     

88
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,863
       "Then three times        
       his name is said.        

89
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,999
         Arrive he does         
    with scares and dread."     

90
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,039
      BOTH: Hungry Larry.       

91
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,441
         Hungry Larry.          

92
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,844
            Hungry Larry.       

93
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,413
          ( knocking )          

94
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,517
          ( knocking )          

95
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,525
      Uh, Star Butterfly?       

96
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,860
        You summoned me.        

97
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,764
     Can I come in or what?     

98
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,566
Star, invite him in.            

99
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,501
             Please, come on in.

100
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,806
      Honey, I know you're      
  probably totally humiliated   

101
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,942
       that you wrestled        
       that blow-up doll        

102
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,910
      in front of your son      
        and his friends,        

103
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,214
      but everyone inside       
           loves you.           

104
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,216
           ( sighs )            

105
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,953
  There's a bowl of candy corn  
 for you out here on the porch. 

106
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,655
               Don't step on it.

107
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,191
           Rafael, I can see you
           in the window!       

108
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,329
So, basically,                  
we just need the house          

109
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,964
to be, like,                    
super scary.                    

110
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,833
Mr. Diaz hasn't scared          
a single kid all night.         

111
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,803
Actually, I don't know          
if he's ever scared             
a single kid ever.              

112
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,104
        But Janna and I         
       are pretty handy,        

113
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,472
      so how can we help?       

114
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,475
 - ( practicing scary noises )  
            - Larry?            

115
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,444
    ( continues practicing )    

116
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,913
                  Larry,        
                  whatcha doing?

117
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,915
          Oh, you guys          
        are still here?         

118
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,283
We're not guys.                 

119
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,486
             Cool.              
         Can you leave?         

120
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,522
                 Uh, yeah, yeah.
                 Okay, fine.    

121
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,090
                 You're working.
                 I get it.      

122
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,059
You guys                        
are still here?                 

123
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:32,097
           That guy isn't scary.
           He's creepy.         

124
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,667
( sighs ) Bummer.               
I really just wanted Mr. D.     
to have his haunted house.      

125
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,669
       Even if you did give him 
           a haunted house,     

126
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,172
              that wouldn't make
              Mr. Diaz scary.   

127
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,307
Yeah, maybe not.                

128
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,009
But at least                    
it'd be something.              

129
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,644
Should we just                  
call it off?                    

130
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:46,978
                   You mean fire
                   Hungry Larry?

131
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,313
I guess.                        

132
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,881
             Oh, can I fire him?

133
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,050
          - Go for it.          
             - Yes!             

134
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,887
         Poor Mr. Diaz.         

135
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,823
       ( Janna shrieks )        

136
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:01,393
    ( shrieking continues )     

137
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,963
Star, what was that?            

138
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,165
      - Uh, I think             
      it was Janna.             
      - ( doorbell rings )      

139
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,001
         ( clamoring )          

140
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:14,506
 Hey, did that scream come from 
 inside of this haunted house?  

141
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,007
             Uh...              

142
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,809
      Yes. Welcome, kids,       

143
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,346
                to the Diaz     
                House of Horror!

144
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,581
          ( cheering )          

145
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,549
Star, seriously.                

146
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,084
What is going on?               

147
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,086
      Okay, Marco, I know       
     you said no summoning,     

148
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,589
        but we summoned,        
   we summoned Hungry Larry.    

149
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,890
You what?!                      

150
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,492
       Oh, Chill, Marco.        

151
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,093
       Everyone's having        
         a great time.          

152
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,162
         Can't you hear         
all those bloodcurdling screams?

153
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,997
          ( silence )           

154
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,832
                 I don't hear   
                 anything, Star.

155
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,717
             Candy.             

156
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,952
                 Uh, no duh.    
                 It's Halloween.

157
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,189
                 This is saliva.

158
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,494
         Hungry Larry?          

159
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,031
          ( screams )           

160
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,933
           Where's Hungry Larry?

161
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:19,438
    He's... still... hungry.    

162
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,173
       ( kids screaming )       

163
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:27,078
    KIDS: I'm still hungry.     

164
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,447
     What the...                
     Hungry for what?           

165
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,148
             Marco!             

166
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,983
         ( splashing )          

167
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,158
      KIDS ( whispering ):      
       I'm still hungry.        

168
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,061
       ( voices echoing )       

169
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,802
       GIRL: I'm still...       

170
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,337
        KIDS: ...hungry.        

171
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,206
         ( shrieking )          

172
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,811
   ( loud metal music plays )   

173
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,995
        Oh, no, no, no.         

174
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,199
       ( blow-up doll groaning )

175
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,610
    Honey, I'm... I'm sorry.    

176
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,913
      I thought this year       
   was going to be different.   

177
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,816
             Honey?             

178
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,751
             Kids?              

179
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,523
   Marco, Marco, Marc... oh!    

180
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,263
          Wet ceiling.          

181
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,569
              Oh!               

182
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,671
             Kids.              

183
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,474
        ( eerie voices )        
        They're in here.        

184
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,050
          Who are you?          

185
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,252
        ( many voices )         
         I'm Hungry...          

186
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,556
       ( clears throat )        

187
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,691
         ( one voice )          
       I'm Hungry Larry.        

188
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,661
    I've been summoned here     
      to haunt your home,       

189
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:26,998
because you're                  
not scary.                      

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,234
    But where is my family?     

191
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,870
          I told you.           

192
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,104
         They're in...          

193
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,006
        ( many voices )         
            ...here.            

194
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,275
            - Help!             
     - Get us out of here!      

195
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,276
             Kids!              

196
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,446
         Oh, your wife          
        is in here, too.        

197
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,515
       Um, uh, somewhere.       

198
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,116
         She's pretty.          

199
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,285
         Oh. Thank you.         

200
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,955
     I would eat you, too,      

201
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,524
        but I'm stuffed.        

202
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,861
            So, uh,             
     count your blessings.      

203
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,129
            I guess.            

204
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,866
         But my family          
        is my blessings.        

205
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,868
              Oh.               

206
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,273
    What I meant to say was,    
           <i> get out!!</i>           

207
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:24,189
          Give me back          
           my family!           

208
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,271
       ( girl shrieking )       

209
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,173
       ( all screaming )        

210
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,193
           Aww!                 

211
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,695
           Mr. Diaz!            

212
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,131
      You were terrifying       
           in there.            

213
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:09,701
      Best Halloween ever!      

214
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,836
               Yeah, Dad,       
               that was amazing.

215
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,304
It's like I always say.         

216
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,173
Nothing more terrifying         

217
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,808
than a man                      
who has lost everything.        

218
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,510
       Leave this place.        

219
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,283
   LARRY: How rude. Whatever.   

220
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,071
            Oh, man!            

221
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,240
   ( coughing and groaning )    

222
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,711
        We got chewed up        
         and spit out.          

223
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,146
          Why the sour          
        word play, guys?        

224
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,915
         How about some         
           Cold Ones            

225
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,383
      for my number ones?       

226
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,352
Yeah, you're all                
my number ones. Ha ha!          

227
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,354
       You're number one,       
            Spider.             

228
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,490
I don't know why you guys       
are acting all sore,            

229
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,559
because the battle I saw        
was like,                       

230
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,260
"Oh, I'm Mr. Bad Guy.           

231
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,362
I'm gonna eat up                
the childrens."                 

232
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,431
And then the warnicorns         
came in and were all, like,     

233
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,266
    ( roaring )                 

234
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,403
and the bad guy was, like,      
"I didn't mean any harm."       

235
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,271
      He is totally right.      

236
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,173
            No, no!             

237
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,010
          ( laughing )          

238
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,414
 And, the<i> piece de resistance,</i>  

239
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,083
      that Narwhal Blast!       

240
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,252
          ( yelling )           

241
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,421
   ( laughing and cheering )    

242
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,757
        STAR:<i> Toothpaste</i>        
          <i> tidal blast!</i>         

243
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,259
                You're up, bud. 

244
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,597
       Looks like Star's        
     getting ready for bed.     

245
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,865
                 See you guys   
                 in the morning.

246
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,299
Night, dude.                    

247
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,400
           Night.               

248
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,802
         ( gibberish )          

249
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,471
      Hey, Spider, we all       
     really appreciate you.     

250
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:57,809
  Everything we do is the most  
    important life or death     
    situation all the time,     

251
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,045
  and it's nice to be greeted   
   with something frivolous,    

252
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,715
        something light.        
  See you in the morning, bud.  

253
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,117
         Hey, Narwhal.          

254
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,320
         For real, how do you do
         that Narwhal Blast?    

255
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,122
It's easy.                      
You hear the call,              

256
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,758
and your warrior spell          
instincts kick in.              

257
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,361
It's like...                    
Narwhal Blast!                  

258
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,732
        But hey, I like         
       the way you do it.       

259
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,367
          Good night.           

260
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,913
     Spider with a top hat      
             blast!             

261
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,152
       I will break you.        

262
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,189
     Spider with a top hat      
             blast!             

263
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,026
             Blast!             
         Top hat blast!         

264
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,494
         Top hat blast!         

265
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,697
         Top hat blast!         
         Top hat blast!         

266
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,034
         Top hat blast!         

267
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,936
    ( alarm clock buzzing )     

268
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,537
          ( groaning )          

269
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,706
     ( buzzing continues )      

270
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,775
          ( groaning )          

271
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,523
        Rise and shine.         

272
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,693
        Whoo! Whoo hoo!         

273
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,698
Yeah!                           

274
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,334
            Morning!            

275
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,203
             Whee!              

276
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,407
     Oh, everyone's happy.      

277
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,509
       ( all exclaiming )       

278
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,912
        Morning spells.         

279
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,213
              Ooh.              

280
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,548
        ( all gasping )         

281
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,453
            Oh. Ow!             

282
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,926
              Ow.               

283
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,161
          ( cracking )          

284
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,230
            Ow. Ow.             

285
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,933
                   Are you okay?
                   What happened
                   to your leg? 

286
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,601
           I'm fine.            
      I just slept funny.       

287
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,404
          Oh, Spider, everything
          you do is funny.      

288
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,539
                    ( giggling )

289
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,708
         Let's curl it!         

290
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,245
         ( straining )          

291
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,714
       Hey, Rock, can I work out
       a few sets with you?     

292
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,217
          It's Spider!          

293
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,852
     So you wanna work out      
       with the big dogs?       

294
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,621
Start with a one-ounce          
and a two-ounce.                

295
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,024
               Actually, I want 
               a big weight like
               you guys.        

296
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,592
Oh, yeah, well,                 
you should probably             

297
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,527
leave the big weights           
to us, Spider dog.              

298
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,795
        But I can do it.        

299
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,032
Uh, well, he does have          
the headband. Okay.             

300
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,467
       Let 'er rip, boys.       

301
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,269
         ( struggling )         

302
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,438
      I'm doin' it, guys!       

303
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,706
          Guys, look.           
         I'm doin' it.          

304
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,474
     Uh, we haven't let go      
           of it yet.           

305
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,209
         ( straining )          

306
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,711
       Oh, well, come on,       
        let it go then.         

307
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,449
Spider? You good?               

308
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,319
    Uh... how do you do it?     

309
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,554
  Take that kind of punishment  
           every day            

310
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,989
     and go back for more?      

311
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,224
I don't know.                   
Push through the pain, I guess. 

312
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,760
                  Yeah, I kinda 
                  like the pain.

313
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,329
                         Pain!  

314
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,064
   Pain!                        

315
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,632
          BOTH: Pain!           

316
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,971
  Spider with a top hat blast!  

317
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,406
        Get up, Spider.         

318
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,509
     Push through the pain.     

319
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,145
        Is that the face        
         of a quitter?          

320
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,181
              No!!              

321
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,749
      ( mirror shatters )       

322
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,784
        Warrior spirit!         

323
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:30,555
          Spider with           
        a top hat blast!        

324
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:37,595
   Spider with a... top hat.    

325
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,563
              Huh?              

326
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,700
           ( gasps )            

327
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,670
            Spider.             

328
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,672
         Narwhal, I got         
     something to show you.     

329
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,507
     All right, what is it?     

330
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,047
          Spider with           
        a top hat blast!        

331
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,384
         Dude, that's hilarious.
         ( raucous laughter )   

332
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,719
     No. I'm being serious.     

333
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,355
               Oh, I thought    
               you were kidding.

334
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,325
   Look, singing and dancing    
           is great,            

335
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,794
         but fighting,          
      you could get hurt.       

336
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,529
           Or worse.            

337
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,631
You could get                   
Star killed.                    

338
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,801
          Good night.           
           ( crying )           

339
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,970
          Hey, Spider.          
            Come on.            

340
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,739
Honey, is everything            
all right?                      

341
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,142
          - I hope so.          
        - ( baby cries )        

342
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,543
          ( groaning )          

343
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,412
           ( coughs )           

344
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,747
             11:30?             
         We overslept.          

345
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,916
                 I gotta get    
                 to work, honey.

346
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,419
        - Everybody up.         
    - This isn't good, guys.    

347
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,754
     - Where's Spider, dog?     
   - What happened to Spider?
