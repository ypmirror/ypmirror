00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,002
 -Not a single word!            
 -...that they would like you-- 

124
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,504
  I must be out of batteries.   

125
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,240
    You're not even trying.     
    You see?                    

126
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,941
        He acts like            
        that thing doesn't work.

127
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,845
   Okay, uh, thank you,         
   Lord and Lady Scarsguard.    

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,814
             Welcome to my life.
             [whimpers]         

129
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,916
         -Okay...               
         -[taps table]          

130
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,318
         Sir Muscleton!         

131
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,653
What's up, baby girl.           

132
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,988
        What did you...         

133
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,990
     -[chair legs squeak]       
     -What did you call me?     

134
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:57,262
I think I called                
you... baby girl.               

135
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,496
Aah!                            

136
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,265
    Yeah, so                    
    Sir Dashing of Muscleton    

137
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,666
      isn't gonna be able       
      to help us.               

138
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,867
     Marco, what do ya got?     

139
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,036
   What about Mina Loveberry?   

140
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,605
Oh, right, Mina!                
[laughs] Perfect!               

141
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,274
That nut mix                    
is a one-woman army!            

142
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,775
       Way ahead of you!        

143
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,477
      We already sent Mina      
      out to do just that.      

144
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,978
         Aha-ha, great!         

145
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,013
And she lost.                   

146
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,483
     [balloon-like squeak]      

147
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,618
         -Queen Star?           
         -Acting queen!         

148
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,521
         We just need to know   
         what the Royal Kitchen 
         should make for dinner.

149
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,156
           Just choose anything!

150
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,026
   Queen Moon always decided    
   on the menu, not us.         

151
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,028
             Okay. Well, today's
             the day you start! 

152
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,229
                    Surprise me.

153
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,897
           Of course.           

154
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,566
     What would you like us     
     to surprise you with?      

155
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,739
                     Star! Wait!

156
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,140
What is it, Dad?                

157
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,875
        I want to help you plan.

158
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,044
Oh, Yes!                        
Oh, thank you, Papa.            

159
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,679
How do we stop                  
Meteora?                        

160
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,347
    No, I meant the dinner menu.

161
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,182
            I've got some ideas.

162
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,184
Ugh, not helping, Dad.          

163
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,488
           I'm sorry, Star,     
           but you're queen now.

164
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,857
            I've seen how strong
            you've grown.       

165
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,358
           You'll figure it out.

166
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,529
        And whatever you decide,
        I'll back you!          

167
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,564
      Think about a corn medley.

168
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,600
            Cornbread, cornmeal.

169
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,002
           That's an entire meal
           of corn.             

170
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,837
[sighs] Thanks, Dad.            

171
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,973
I do love corn.                 

172
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,976
         -Globgor!              
         -[Star groans]         

173
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,915
Mommm!                          
Your job is really hard!        

174
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,949
       I need your help.        

175
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,618
     I can't do this alone.     

176
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,153
            [sighs]             

177
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,589
[sniffs]                        

178
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,058
                   Glossaryck,  
                   what do I do?

179
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,361
           -Globgor!            
           -Arghh!              

180
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,563
         -Globgor!              
         -[Star growls]         

181
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,400
Uh, buddy, the chefs            
are working on dinner,          

182
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,636
but they wanted me              
to ask you about dessert.       

183
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:49,374
         Argh! How am I supposed
         to delegate anything   
         to these cornheads?    

184
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,943
     Can't anybody here actually
     think for themselves       

185
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,812
          without my mom around?

186
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,414
    Good day,                   
    acting Queen Butterfly!     

187
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,550
         Finally,               
         somebody gets it right.

188
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,419
            I have your laundry,
            freshly pressed!    

189
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,154
        Thank you, just leave it
        on the thing.           

190
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,989
       I've sorted it all       
       from your favorite       

191
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,257
    to least favorite color     

192
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,293
    and removed                 
    a couple stains I found.    

193
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:12,997
      I also re-dyed a few items
      to better compliment      
      your skin tone.           

194
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,467
Oh... thank you.                
That's actually really helpful. 

195
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,469
    I also ironed your socks    

196
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,972
    -and re-hemmed your         
    favorite dinosaur skirt.    
    -Wow, that's amazing.       

197
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,409
It seemed better to head off    
the problem before it got worse.

198
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,012
  Why didn't I see it before?!  
  Lavabo, its you!              

199
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,280
             -Me?               
             -Him?!             

200
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,281
              You!              

201
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,683
Steadfast Lavabo,               

202
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,318
dependable Lavabo!              

203
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,620
Sir Lavabo,                     
I have a job for you.           

204
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,622
           -What?!              
           -My queen,           

205
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,291
           it would be          
           an honor to serve you
           in any way--         

206
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,927
      No, no. No, no, no.       
      Nuh-uh, no way.           

207
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,662
 Can you, um-- Can you          
 please excuse us for just a--  

208
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:48,032
     What are you thinking?     
     You can't send him!        

209
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,634
Do you have                     
a better plan, squire?          

210
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,803
Because I have been waiting     
to hear one all day!            

211
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,806
          Me. Send me.          

212
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,275
You? Marco, no offense,         

213
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,178
but it's gonna take             
more than a red belt            
to defeat Meteora.              

214
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:05,049
      You forget I have 16 years
      of experience fighting    
      thousands of Hekapoos.    

215
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,186
           Go ahead, hit me     
           with your best spell!

216
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,121
Marco, I'm                      
not gonna fight you.            

217
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,523
                Weeaakkk!       

218
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,191
Ugh! Come on, Marco,            

219
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,692
I really don't have time        
for this nonsense--

222
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,066
           Come on, Star, I said
           your best spell!

226
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,742
            My turn!            

227
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,677
         Uh! Not cool!

242
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,551
           -Aaah!               
           -Whoa-ho!            

243
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,453
            -Aaaah!             
            -Aaaah!             

244
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,255
           Glooobgor!           

245
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,224
           [grunting]           

246
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,793
           [squeaks]            

247
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,130
         [both panting]         

248
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,236
Okay, not bad, Diaz.            

249
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,273
              [laughs] Told you!

250
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,576
            No, Star,           
            my abs are not back.

251
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,044
Just checking.                  

252
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,046
Look, just because              
you can take on my spells       

253
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,115
doesn't mean                    
you can take on Meteora.        

254
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,085
I don't                         
know if anyone can.             

255
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,821
    Your mom can.               
    You heard what Eclipsa said.

256
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,323
       If she hadn't interfered,
       your mom would           
       have beaten Meteora.     

257
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,392
       I don't have to stop her.

258
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,929
    I just have to              
    buy you time to find        
    your mom and bring her back.

259
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,798
Okay, we gotta                  
divide and conquer.             

260
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,935
You keep Meteora                
from reaching the castle        
while I go find my mom.         

261
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,336
      How are you gonna do that?

262
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,338
My mom is stuck                 
in the magic dimension.         

263
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,307
I gotta go there                
to find her.                    

264
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,143
           But that's where     
           you lost your memory.

265
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,512
        That's really dangerous.

266
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:19,017
I know,                         
but I don't have a choice.      

267
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,619
Okay, as acting queen,          

268
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:25,623
I order you,                    
my squire Marco Diaz,           

269
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,926
to do whatever it takes         
to stop Meteora                 

270
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,928
from reaching                   
Butterfly Castle.               

271
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,364
             I accept my orders.

272
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,702
Okay, well, then                
you get started on              
that order right away.          

273
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,140
       Hey, Star. Y'know,       
       you don't have to pretend
       to be strong around me.  

274
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,941
           I'm your best friend.

275
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,512
Mmm. Uhh! I need a hug!         

276
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,717
              I'm really scared.

277
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,319
                Yeah... me, too.

278
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,157
         Hello, Queen Butterfly!
         Dinner is served!      

279
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,192
    -Great talking.             
    -Yes. Thank you, friend.    

280
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,960
Just a talk, bro.               

281
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,364
           Uh... anyway,        
           we did what you said.

282
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,865
                We got creative!

283
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,200
           [jiggling]           

284
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,702
Good first try.                 

285
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,737
                   Can I go now?

286
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,214
Oh, hey! It's you!              

287
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,049
                You wanna paddle
                around with me? 

288
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,719
    No! Nu-nu-nu-nu-no way,     
    buster!                     

289
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,321
    If I have fun with you,     
    I'll forget who I am        

290
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,656
   and be stuck here forever.   

291
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,858
   Yeah!                        
   Doesn't that sound great?!   

292
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,426
         Nice try, but this time
         I came prepared!       

293
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,061
[buzzing]                       

294
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,496
     [Star, on recording]       
     You are Star Butterfly.    

295
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,765
     You must find your mom     
     and bring her home.        

296
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,233
      I am Star Butterfly.      

297
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,603
      I must find my mom        
      and bring her home.       

298
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,071
                 Okay, have fun!

299
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,240
               I'll see ya soon!

300
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,708
    I've called you all here    

301
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,343
       because you're           
       the most cunning,        

302
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,377
     the most agile,            
     the most experienced,

     I know.                    

304
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,382
  Each of you                   
  were hand-picked for          
  your specific set of skills.  

305
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,252
      Hekapoo's basically       
      a one-woman army,         

306
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,055
    and she's also on fire.

  -Talon is... is really big,   

308
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,560
      and I think Hekapoo       
      has a crush on him,       

309
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,896
   but it's probably            
   just because of his body.    

310
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,098
          Wait. What?

  And then Jorby and Kelly...

Ahhh!

    ...they're, um, well...

  Kelly's got a lot of swords!  

315
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,377
 Anyway, I feel proud to call   
 you my "Marc-nificent Seven."

317
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,314
           Oh, yeah, good point.
           You're right, Jorby. 

318
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,284
           Yeah, Jorby says, uh,
           your math is off.    

319
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,219
       Yeah, there's only, uh...

320
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,155
         There's only four of us
         here plus you.         

321
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,824
           That's five.         
           Two short of a seven.

322
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,292
      He forgot about me!

00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,060
          -Uh...                
          -Who's that?          

324
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,762
       No, I-- I didn't         
       forget about you.        

325
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,430
        I-- You're late.        

326
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,733
And what is that thing          
on your head?                   

327
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,835

                 my battle axe. 

328

              I'm basically     
              like a cyborg now.

329
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,438
           I could change       
           into anything I want.

    there were seven of us.

           the plan or what?!

             Oh, yes.           
             The plan is simple.

351
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,020
            We're gonna build...

352

           Jorby and Kelly,     
           you're gonna make    
           a huge dugout circle.

355
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,628
      Talon and Pony will       
      fill it with wood.
