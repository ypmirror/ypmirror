  some things, young lady,      

56
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,124
    you need to know            
    before we go inside.        

57
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,726
          ( mumbles excitedly ) 
                           Kay! 

58
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,762
         The wand is            
 an extension of your your--    

59

   to listen to me or not?

          Oh, sorry.            

62
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,770
   As I was saying,             
   the wand...                  

63
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,672
    is an extension             
    of your memories.           

64
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:24,643
  So you must find the thing    
    that does not belong.       

65
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,311
        Find the thing          
        that doesn't belong.

00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,813
 Good. Are you ready?           

67
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,681
            Maybe.              
          ( claps )             

68
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,683
    All right. We're inside.    

69
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,185
                          What? 
    But we're still in my room. 

70
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,654
We're in the memory             
of your room.                   

71
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,923
 Inside of your wand.           

72
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,224
              ( inhales loudly )

74
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:44,229
   Yes. From this point on,     
  it's very, very important     

75
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,665
     that you listen only       
  to the sound of my voice.     

76

77

78
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,404

         of my voice.           

82
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,412
Otherwise,                      
we will be separated.           

83
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,681
Hey. Have you seen my hoodie?   
      Marco, I told you.

87
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,690
                        School? 
           ( frustrated groan ) 

88
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,126
    Okay, Glossaryck, no.       
  I'm not going to school...    

89
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,694

         This is one            
    of those mind things.       

94
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,839
       Where everywhere you go, 
                there's school. 

95
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,908
    School. School. School!     

96
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,811
   School. School. School.      
          ( grunts )

00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,881

       ( softly ) Whaa...       

101
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,424
            That's Marco's.     

102
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,126
          ( gasps )             
    Well, this definitely       
       doesn't belong!          

103
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,728
         Over, under,

107
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,002
          Beam me out!          

108

00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,015
 Oh, burger time.               

114
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,484
             Don't mind if I do.

115
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,219
             ( munching softly )

116
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,887
             Mmm. Memory burger.

117
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,225
          ( bleats )            
           Oh, no!              

118
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,194
       ( bleats loudly )        

119
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,795
           ( grunts )           

120
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,431
           ( bleats )           

121
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,300
                  Your welcome! 
         ( softly ) Who're you? 

122
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,468
                   Lil Chauncey.

123
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,136
         Lil Chauncey, Chauncey?

124
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,838
      ( bleats )                

125
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:32,838
                        Like... 
         my mom's Lil Chauncey? 

126
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,542
          (playful)             
   I'm pretty sure you died     
 on the battlefield, mister!    

127
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:37,542
      Let's get you out of here.

128
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:42,914
                Hey Glossaryck! 
      I think I found the thing 
           that doesn't belong! 

129
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:42,914
              My mom's pig-goat.

130
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:42,914
 ( bleats and snaps angrily )   
     Hey, hey, hey, hey!        

131
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:47,919
             That's my boot!    
             That's my boot!    
             Hey! Hey...        

132
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,188
              ( bleats happily )

133
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,460
Hey, you!                       
Gimme back my boot!             

134
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,528
    And get down!               

135
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:56,528
   Sitting like a person.       

136
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,334
  My father would be furious    
   if he caught you sitting     
 in his-- ( horrified gasp )    

137
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,806
     ( gasps ) Oh, Papa!        
( softly ) I love you so much!  

138
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,342
      ( radio crackle )         
  Gloassaryck, I definitely     
     found the thing now.       

139
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,878
      ( loudspeaker screeches ) 
    Can you come and pick me up 
            from school please? 

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,913
              Aah! What is that?

141
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,521
That definitely                 
doesn't belong.                 

142
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:23,989
        Let's go get it.        

143
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,194
          ( squish )            
    ( fishing rod whirs )       

144
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,930
   Move out, Lil Chauncey!      
           Hyaaah!              

145
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,933
         Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

146
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,104
           Hey!                 

147
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,007
           Uh... Hey.           

148
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,442
Where are you headed?           

149
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,977
       Well, I was just         
    going to the foo-fo...      

150
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,846
        Football field          
     and Mewni Castle...        

151
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,014
        Wait a minute.          
         Who are you?           

152
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,883
I'm Star Butterfly!             

153
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,452
      Nuh-uh, you're not.       

154
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,886
Did you find the thing          
that doesn't belong?            

155
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,455
              N-n-not exactly...

156
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:59,291
  I mean I found Marco's hoodie 
       and my dad's chair and-- 

157
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,159
            ( grunting )        
            Lil Chauncey here.  

158
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,295
          ( bleats )            
          ( grunts )            

159
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,496
           Wait a minute.       
           ( sighs )            

160
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,897
           Why are there        
           two of us here?      

161
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,199
Didn't Glossaryck tell you?     

162
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,034
If you're inside                
your wand too long,             

163
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,269
 all your new memories          
 become your old memories.      

164
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,871
Until eventually                
your current timeline           

165
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,040
is overwritten                  
by the future                   
versions of yourself,           

166
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,441
    like me!                    

167
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,410
 Star Butterfly!                

168
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,046
          Wait...               
          so, you're gonna      
          replace me?           

169
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,881
( laughing ) Yeah!              
But don't worry.                

170
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,449
      You'll never know         
       the difference.          

171
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,219
         I gotta go.            
      ( squeals loudly )        

172
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,955
                      ( bleats )

173
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,623
       Oh, I forgot to tell you.

174
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,393
       ( threatening )          
   Stay out of my timeline.     

175
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,329
         ( sweetly )            
           Thanks!              

176
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,932
     Fine. I'll just get        
   my own timeline. Moody.      

177
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,401
STAR:                           
I guess I'm going to school.    

178
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,969
            Hey!                

179
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,007
          ( bleating loudly )   

180
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,342
          Hello!                

181
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,010
        Go away!                

182
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,013
( Stars calling                 
one after another )             
Hello! Hello! Hello!            

183
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,348
          ( gasps )             
           Okay...              

184
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,251
 ( door creeks open )           

185
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,952
 ( door creaks shut )           

186
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,587
                      Oh! Stop! 
  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. 

187
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,022
                 Whoa...        

188
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,957
       This is the grandma room.

189
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,093
     Oh, I haven't been in here 
     since I was a little baby. 

190
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,561
            ( grunts and gasps )

191
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,631
                 Are you nuts?! 
              There's no eating 
           in the grandma room! 

192
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,033
      You'll get crumbs         
         everywhere!            
        ( loud thud )           

193
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,401
        ( clattering )          
        ( Star gasps )          

194
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,970
        ( slow grating )        

195
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,246
         ( loud thud )          

196
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,183
                 Oh, no, no, no.

197
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,086
 We got burger juice            
 on the wall rug, Chauncey.     

198
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,588
    ( inhales nervously )       
         ( squelch )            

199
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,089
          ( shouting in panic ) 
       Oh, no! We're gonna die! 

200
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,492
          ( grating )           

201
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,996
Celena the Shy?                 

202
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,966
Ooh...great,                    
great grandma Shy!              

203
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,268
What hides behind               
the golden fan,                 

204
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,170
 the hand does sweetly hold     

205
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,140
a trove of cosmic secrets       
that never will be told.        

206
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,609
        ( whispering )          
        Don't be shy!           

207
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,144
        You can tell me.        

208
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,313
       Right, Chauncey?         
          Chauncey?             

209
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,082
               Noo! No, no, no! 
        Get a hold of yourself, 
                      Chauncey! 

210
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,250
( Chauncey grunts )             

211
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,553
Solaria the Monster Carver.     
( gasps in awe )                

212
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,156
A castle stormed                
is a hero born                  

213
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,425
 with might as strong as steel. 

214
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,260
 Kneels the void before her     

215
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,996
and the crushing force          
she wields.                     

216
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,165
     ( bleating loudly )        
     Chauncey, come back!       

217
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,666
 ( hisses softly )              

218
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,767
         ( gasps ) Oh.          

219
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,704
    Eclipsa, Queen of Mewni     

220
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,006
  to a Mewmen King was wed.     
     ( inhales sharply )        

221
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,208
      But took a monster        
         for her love           

222
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,511
   and away from Mewni fled.    

223
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,012
         ( shudders )           
         Bad girl...            

224
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,214
         ( grunting )           
       What is it, boy?         
       What'd you find?         

225
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,582
( bleating loudly )             

226
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,051
   Aww, that's you, isn't it?   

227
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,187
       Before you died.         
          ( gasps )             

228
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,122
       that means this          
      is Mom's tapestry!        

229
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,025
           Get off!             
          ( bleats )            

230
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,761
The immortal monster            
will long be haunted            

231
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:53,565
by the darkest spell            
of Moon the Undaunted.          

232
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,302
     My mom fought Toffee?      

233
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,138
( squeaking )                   

234
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,808
        ( squeaking )           
        ( clattering )          

235
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,649
      ( effort grunting )       

236
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,585
          ( gasps )             
     ( heavy breathing )        

237
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,587
 Glossaryck! You're back!       

238
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,324
   Oh! Do you have any idea     
   how difficult that was?      

239
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,459
         Sorry. Moody.          

240
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,229
                        No, no. 
         ( exhales ) It's fine. 

241
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,299
           And-and did you find 
 the thing that doesn't belong? 

242
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,468
Well, I found Marco's hoodie,   
and my dad's chair.             

243
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,137
And Lil' Chauncey over there.   

244
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,772
    ( growls and squeals )      
       ( loud ripping )         

245
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,109
But all these things...         
belong in my memories.          

246
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,579
                  Listen to me. 
          Did you see yourself? 

247
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,080
       Uh-huh...                

248
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,548
    All right. That's not good. 
               That's not good. 

249
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,184
  We gotta get out of here.     
    Step into my eyeball.       

250
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,253
                       I-- Yes. 
            That's what I said. 
               Come on. Hop in. 

251
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,221
        Wait! But I--           
    I didn't fix my wand!       
           ( rip )              

252
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,228
   ( gasps in astonishment )    

253
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,700
       That's the thing         
     that doesn't belong!       

254
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,603
      ( Stars echoing )         
       That's the thing         
     that doesn't belong!       

255
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,540
      Star! We've gotta go now. 
               Get into my eye. 

256
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,379
     All right, that's it!      

257
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,814
     ( Glossaryck shouts )      

258
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,250
           ( pop )              
          ( squish )            

259
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,752
               ( squelch )      

260
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,121
Oh! Boy, that hurt.             

261
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,289
           ( pop )              
            Ugh...              

262
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,557
                 Pupil juice.   

263
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,525
          ( gasps )             
         Glossaryck.            
            What?               

264
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,629
       I think we did it.       

265
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,265
  Yeah. That's kinda gross.     
     Let's get rid of it.       

266
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,272
       Uh... That's not exactly 
                  what I meant. 

267
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,142
   You know what? ( sighs )     
  I think my mom was right.     

268
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,311
     I'm not tall enough        
     to go on this ride.        

269
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,318
     I'm not tall enough        
      to go on any ride.        

270
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,220
   But I've been on them all.   

271
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,657
               Your, uh...      
               Your eyeball...  

272
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,325
     is uh... ( softly )        
  falling out a little bit.     

273
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,294
    Oh, thanks. Thank you.      
      Let me just, uh...        
          ( laughs )            

274
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,629
 You gonna test out that wand?  

275
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,165
               I think I've had 
      enough magic for one day. 

276
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,366
                           Hey! 
       Have you seen my hoodie? 

277
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,702
         ( screams and grunts ) 
             ( groans in pain ) 

278
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,270
 It worked!                     

279
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,275
               This is the best 
                 makeover ever! 

280
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,513
This princess looks fly-ayy     

281
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,682
 and she's ready to partay!     

282
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,717
                        Ladies! 
      What's up with your lips? 

283
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,888
    Don't be hate'n 'cause      
 we look good and you don't!    

284
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,723
    What are you talking about? 
              I look all right. 

285
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,325
Marco! Why don't you            
tell Ponyhead what we got her?  

286
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,728
              Uhh... we got you 
          something special for 
        your first friendship-- 

287
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,263
( singsong )                    
Friendship Thursday!            

288
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,365
    Hook a girl up already!     

289
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,867
   It's a friendship snuggly!   

290
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,270
                   Uh... great. 
                Thanks, guys... 

291
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,305
        But how are we          
        gonna dance in this?    

292
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,574
We're not going dancing, silly! 

293
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,277
       Excuse me, what?         
       ( phone rings )          

294
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,380
Fifteen minutes                 
to show time!                   

295
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,350
I'm gonna go get the pizza.     

296
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,886
         ( whining )            
            Pizza?              
            Yeah!               

297
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,522
You can't watch                 
"Fiesta de la Noche"            
without pizza!                  

298
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,424
     Fist full of what the what?

299
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,792
 It's this awesome telanovela   

300
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,361
            about three friends 
        that go out every night 

301
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,763
 and have all sorts of fun!     

302
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,431
          Uh... ( chuckles )    
          Okay, yeah.           

303
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,866
       We're just gonna         
       sit on the couch         

304
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,569
   and watch other people party 
   on that rectangle box thing. 

305
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,003
            ( laughs )          
            Okay. Go on.        

306
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,605
( giggles )                     
Oh, yeah, baby!                 

307
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,674
That's what                     
Friendship Thursday             

308
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,309
  ( softly )                    
  is all about.                 

309
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,578
                 ( spits )      

310
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,346
             Uh... I have to go 
               to the bathroom. 

311
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,252
                      Hey, hey! 
           Looking good, Marco! 

312
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,754
Thanks, Mr. Vendrosian!         

313
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,589
You're lookin' good yourself!   

314
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,291
          Hey, Marco!           
          My watch stopped.     

315
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,293
       Can you tell me          
       what day it is?          

316
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,962
  You know what day it is.      

317
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,730
    Friendship Thursday!        

318
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,499
      Um...                     

319
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,268
  Uh, actually,                 
  it's my birthday.             

320
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,438
 I thought you knew.            

321
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,774
   Poneyhead...                 

322
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,510
 Please go back to the house.   

323
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,379
   ( annoyed )                  
   Huh...                       

324
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,648
      Alright, I'm gonna        
    squeeze past you here.      

325
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,350
                         Sorry. 
         ( whispering ) Weirdo. 

326
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,021
            Ponyhead...         

327
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:10,021
             What are you doing?

328
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:14,692
  Come on!                      
  I want to see some            
  Earthian night life!          

329
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,463
  I'm just picking up the pizza 
            and getting it back 
        before the show starts. 

330
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,998
          Let's go.             
             No.                

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
  ( whining loudly )            
  Please!                       

332
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,770
             No!                
        ( screaming )           
           Please!              

333
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,439
     ( singsong whining )       
           Please!              

334
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,942
      ( groans audibly )        
         Okay, fine!            

335
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,744
        You can come.           
            Yeah!               

336
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,078
      Woohoo!                   

337
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,581
    Just none of that Poneyhead 
           stuff you always do. 

338
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,750
 I don't even know              
 what you're talking about.     

339
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,352
                   Just promise 
   we're gonna go get the pizza 

340
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,620
      and nothing else.         
      ( Ponyhead sighs )        

341
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,455
       ( groaning )             
       Fine!                    

342
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,623
    I pinky promise.            

343
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,325
  ( gagging loudly )            

344
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,326
       ( coughs )               

345
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,894
     I'm not touching that.     

346
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,666
So, what's this pizza thing     
you guys keep talking about?    

347
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,901
             Whoa-a-a-a Nelliee!

348
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,071
              Did you just call 
      Emilio's Pizza "a thing"? 

349
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,940
  Uh... I guess.                

350
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,075
        Emilio's Pizza          
       is not a thing.          

351
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,344
     His family has been        
    making pizza forever.       

352
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,848
    His recipes goes back       
    to a time before pizza      
        even existed.           

353
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,051
Oh, my gogo!                    
Look at those skinny jeans!     

354
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,854
Those are some                  
skinny-skinny jeans.            
Like very skinny.               

355
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,056
     What are you doing?        
        Okay, come on!          

356
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,524
Let me just go in               
and get a pair.                 

357
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,359
It'll just take a second.       

358
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,595
        You promised.           
         No distrac--           
        ( bell dings )          

359
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,864
                Really?         

360
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,866
     Check me out, Marco!       

361
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,501
                     Excuse me! 
        Are those skinny jeans? 

362
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,904
   Why, yes, they are.          

363
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,673
                        No way! 
      I'm wearing skinny jeans! 

364
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,409
 ( electronic music playing )   
( Skinny Jeans gang partying )  

365
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:44,082
  ( all cheering and hooting )  

366
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,085
               MARCO: Poneyhead!

367
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,388
         Hey, Ponyhead!         

368
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,923
      The pizza! Remember?      

369
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,424
       ( sirens screech )       

370
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,726
               Everybody freeze!

371
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,427
   I'm shutting this party down.

372
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,799
                    Till we get 
   Little Red Riding Hood there 
   into a pair of skinny jeans! 

373
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,535
     ( pants squeaking )        
      ( Marco grunting )        

374
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,773
      When you promised         
   we'd just get the pizza!     

375
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,408
 How does that fit into this?   

376
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,644
   Oh, shut up, baby girl.      
   You know you look good.      

377
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:15,513
           Check it out, Marco. 
                I got us a cab. 

378
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,848
           Oh. Great.           

379
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,585
 Uh, we're going                
 to Emilio's pizza.             

380
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,488
      ( nervous exhale )        
      Just take the car.        

381
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,089
 Don't hurt me!                 

382
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,991
   I don't think this is a taxi.

383
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:30,128
Oh, don't blame me!             
It's not my fault that          
people like to give me stuff!   

384
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,529
                  What did you--

385
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,965
       ( tires screech )        

386
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,205
    ( cars honking loudly )     

387
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,543
                   Okay, Marco, 
      tell me how to get there! 

388
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,478
Pony! You need                  
to stop this car right now!     

389
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,447
    Come on. Just tell me       
   and I'll drive us there!     

390
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,482
        Stop the car.           
  Tell me how to get there.     

391
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,051
        Stop the car.           
         But tell me            
      how to get there.         

392
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,452
        Stop the car.           
       Tell me how to--         

393
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,788
       ( Marco screams )        

394
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,593
             Gah!               
    ( panicked breathing )      

395
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,595
         I-uh-- I --            
         ( screams )            

396
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,632
                    Uh... Okay. 
            What are you doing? 

397
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,000
We just stole this thing!       

398
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:09,000
I have to get rid               
of the evidence.                

399
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:13,538
( panicking )                   
We gotta get as far away        
from this as possible.          

400
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,006
And then report it              
to the police.                  

401
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,941
               ( crash )        

402
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,843
              MARCO: ( crying ) 
            No! No, no, no, no! 

403
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,947
         ( shrieks )            
     ( metal crunching )        

404
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,048
      ( strangled scream )      

405
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,653
           Aww, it's so compact.

406
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,189
         ( sobbing )            
  I'm totally going to jail!    

407
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,724
You're not                      
going to jail, Marco!           

408
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,862
                      PONYHEAD: 
        Go home to daddy, baby! 

409
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,164
         ( honking )            
      ( engine rumbles )        

410
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,500
Okay, let's go                  
get us another car!             

411
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,103
       How about you stop doing 
     all that Ponyhead business 
             we talked about... 

412
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,839
   and let me get us there?     
            Fine.               

413
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,609
                 Hey, up there! 
            How much for a ride 
             to Emilio's Pizza? 

414
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,078
     Uh... $650?                

415
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,015
                  ( sighs )     
                  Okay...       

416
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,118
   ( engine rumbles )           

417
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,856
        Okay, okay...           
         ( inhales )            

418
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,191
Everything's still in order.    
( breathing heavily )           

419
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,559
         We're here...          

420
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,927
        Keep it cool--          
         Oh, my gogo!           

421
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,096
                 It smells like 
          tomatoes and cologne. 

422
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,799
              Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
            What are you doing? 

423
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,769
         You can't just saunter 
    in there with your... sass. 

424
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,571
             This is Emilio's.  

425
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,873
               ( stressing )    
               Emilio's!        

426
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,641
     For once today just...     

427
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,909
      let me handle this.       

428
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,046
             Let me handle this.

429
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,647
         ( bell dings )         

430
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,283
        Just sit here...        

431
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,853
  or float here                 
  in the corner.                
  Don't say a word.             

432
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,056
         ( singing )            
         Hey, Marco!            

433
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,590
         ( singing )            
         Hey, Emilio!           

434
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,025
        ( both singing )        

435
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,961
           Good to see you, kid.

436
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,229
             Here you go, Bubba.

437
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,731
       ( excited exhale )       

438
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,099
            May I?              
          Go ahead.             

439
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,567
   After it's left my oven...   

440
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,002
       it's not my baby.        

441
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,370
     ( excitedly mumbling )     

442
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,741
             Huh...             

443
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,742
           Everything okay?     

444
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,944
          Uh, yeah.             
     Everything's great.        

445
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,713
      Well... ( sighs )         
        Are you sure?           

446
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:02,713
        You made that--         

447
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,184
    You know th-that face       
  I've never seen you make.     

448
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,086
           No, no.              
      It's-it's nothing.        

449
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,154
     I'll just, uh...           
     live with it.              

450
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,756
           Oh. Okay.            

451
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,094
      ( sighs heavily )         
         Actually...            

452
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,995
The thing is...                 

453
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,831
      it's the mushrooms.       

454
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,300
         There aren't           
      as many mushrooms         
     as they usually are.       

455
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,168
        Not as many mushrooms?  
        Let me see...           

456
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,238
      It's-it's totally-        
 it's not a big deal at all.    

457
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,706
                 Okay.          

458
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,741
             One...             

459
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,909
            Two...              
             No.                

460
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,644
           Three...             
          No, don't.            
         Don't count.           

461
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,647
       Four... Five...          
     Please don't count.        

462
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:37,782
        Six... seven... eight...

463
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,151
   Okay, stop. Stop counting.   

464
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,652
                    Ninety-one, 
    ninety-two, ninety three... 

465
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,621
                 Let's not play 
     the number game, you know? 

466
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,858
                   Ninety-four, 
     ninety-five, ninety-six... 

467
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,192
               ( sighs )        

468
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,861
             Ninety-seven!      

469
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,196
             Ninety-eight...    

470
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:52,196
          Huh, yeah.            
          You're right, Marco.  

471
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:57,635
       Usually I put...         
   Put a hundred mushrooms      
  on a pizza, but there's--     

472
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:57,635
  There's only ninety-nine here.

473
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,972
   All this time I thought      
   I was making good pizza.     

474
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,373
         ( squelch )            
    ( trash can rattles )       

475
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,977
                 Uhh, President 
 of the United States liked it! 

476
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,812
The Nobel Peace Prize liked it. 

477
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,680
         None of that matters...

478
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,716
   because it wasn't good enough

479
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,085
        ( menacingly )          
       for Marco Diaz.          

480
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,320
       Well, don't beat         
    yourself up about it.       

481
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,688
    N-n-nobody's perfect.       
       ( phone rings )          

482
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,791
          Emilio's Pizza.       

483
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,760
     I-I-I-- Let me just        
    stop you right there.       

484
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,762
  I cannot take your order.     
( muffled talking over phone )  

485
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,365
    Well! Because I cannot make 
               a perfect pizza! 

486
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,066
  ( muffled talking over phone )

487
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,735
         Oh, well, thank you.   

488
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,670
      That's very sweet of you. 
             I appreciate that. 

489
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,704
  ( muffled talking over phone )

490
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,706
  I think it's very good myself,

491
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,742
          but perfection        
          is a very high bar.   

492
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,844
    So, as of right now, I quit!

493
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,979
( muffled talking over phone )  
Goodbye, and have a nice life.  

494
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,347
        ( over phone )          
 <i> Why are you yelling at me?</i>    

495
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,815
     I am not yelling, sir!     

496
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,151
   No, no. You are yelling.     
      Lower your voice!         

497
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,090
                Not a word.     

498
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,825
  I wasn't gonna say anything.  

499
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,427
                      You know, 
        this is all your fault. 

500
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,862
   With all your Ponyhead stuff.

501
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,864
Ooh, excuse me?                 

502
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,933
     I knew Friendship Thursday 
             wasn't your thing! 

503
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:04,735
                   TV and pizza 
          sounds boring to you. 

504
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,904
   But it's what Star and I     
   like to do on Thursdays!     

505
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,173
Okay! Well, why did you         
even invite me then? ( scoffs ) 

506
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,741
            I didn't invite you!

507
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,410
     When you're around,        
     everything goes bad!       

508
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:12,410
Why don't you just say it then? 

509
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:17,715
          Fine! There's no room 
            for the three of us 
               in this friend-- 

510
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,218
        ( bell dings )          
       Is Emilio here?          

511
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,752
                    He's gone.  

512
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,854
                   Indefinitely.

513
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,823
           Oh, okay.            

514
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,094
 Do you know why I like pizza?  

515
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,862
No one cares.                   
There's something else          
going on.                       

516
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,098
         It's divided           
     into equal portions        

517
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,400
      so everybody gets         
       the same amount.         

518
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,737
 And, it's got no sharp edges   
    to stab someone with.       

519
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,373
     Because it's round.        
Like the circle of friendship.  

520
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,375
     And I like the cwust!      

521
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,146
                     Truce?     

522
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,982
      Truce!

00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:52,883
                How do you feel 
           about making a pizza 

524
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,252
       with a hundred mushrooms?

525
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,287
 Oh, yeah, Boy!
