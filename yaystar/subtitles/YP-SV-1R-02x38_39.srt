00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,568
Uh, I can see that,

33
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,617
            No. I'm actually

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,919
    Ah, me too.

00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,454
            You know, I think

00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,856
        I'm the first princess  
        to lose everything,

            which is kind

38
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,426
            I'd log it          
            in my spell book,   

39

40
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,429
            and I would tell    
            Glossaryck,         

41
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,231
            but I don't have    
            Glossaryck, either! 

42

            to know where to go 
            or who I am

            have a history?

    what I'm in for, Janna.     

47
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,109
Mm-hmm. Uh...

00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,444
                Because I'm out.

Yo, what did you do?

00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,618
            What<i> did</i> I do?      

51
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,920
You just put Otis               
in the dumpster. Right on.      

52
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,922
            -Otis?              
            -Otis!              

53
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:07,493
You know, he's, like,           
the school mascot or whatever.  

54
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,661
   Okay, probably that shouldn't
        be in the garbage.      

55
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,964
Phew, it's okay.                

56
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,899
That made a crazy sound         
when I threw it in.             

57
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,435

I am so sorry!

            Without Otis,       
            I would be dead.    

64
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,869
            I remember          
            the moment well.    

65
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,505
            It was very cold    
            that day.

00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,842
        Winters here are        
        quite harsh, you know.  

67
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,645
        I was being chased      
        through the halls

69
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,285
            and hid beneath     
            Otis's underside.   

70
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:08,153
            I hid for days,

            survived by eating  
            the frozen gum      

72
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:14,159
            stuck to Otis's

            Grief counseling?   

87
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,367
    Sorry, everyone,            
    no counseling today.        

88
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,903
    I'm too torn up             
    about Otis.                 

89
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,506
    No point in pulling you     
    onto a sinking lifeboat.    

90
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,709
        Uh, Mr. Candle, how can 
        you be torn about Otis? 

91
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,444
        You're not even         
        from this dimension!    

92
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,012
But look at them, Star,         

93
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:10,582
look at their little            
droopy, baby-fat faces!         

94
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,252
Contact grief is                
a real thing, okay?             

95
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,954
                Dang! Oh, dang.

Hey, come on, guys.             

97
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,093
I'm really sorry about Otis.    

98
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,795
Please, is there anything       
I can do to help?               

99
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,231
    Let me fix you.             

100
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,868
            It's not your fault.
            It's our fault.     

101
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,606
Good morning, everybody!        

102
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,141
I've invited you                
all out here                    

103
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,977
to say I'm so sorry             
for yesterday.                  

104
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,912
I made a pretty big mess,       

105
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,815
but I think I made              
some magic today.               

106
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,952
I give you Otis!                

107
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,121
    -Otis is really here?       
    -It's a miracle!            

108
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,790
    Otis? Otis, is that you?    

109
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,727
My dear boy, I thought          
I lost you forever.             

110
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,796
But you're really here!         
Ohh-ho-ho-aah!                  

111
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:02,301
  Wait a second. I used to put  
       my used gum there!       

112
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,969
          Where is it?          

113
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,804
Yeah, and where's               
all the scratches?              

114
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,106
It's too shiny!                 

115
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,409
            And where is        
            the kissing hole?
