    Honey, you've got to try    
      the jumbo megafowl.       

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,990
         It's so moist.         

21
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,492
         It just melts          
         in your mouth.         

22
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,695
You haven't touched             
a thing.                        
What's wrong?                   

23
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,666
       ( sighs heavily )        
   I just can't stop thinking   

24
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,568
     about what happened to     
          Glossaryck.           

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,537
So? He's gone.                  

26
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,439
Good riddance, I say.           

27
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,541
Little guy always               
creeped me out.                 

28
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,743
           But Star is all alone
           on Earth now         

29
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,546
              at a crucial point
              in her training.  

30
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,382
   We may need to consider...   

31
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,350
  bringing her back to Mewni.   

32
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,686
             What?              

33
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,755
        Oh, but she's in        
     the middle of school.      

34
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,557
        We can't disrupt        
      her life like that.       

35
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,461
 Then that leaves us no choice  
   but to have her evaluated.   

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,532
        No, no, no, no.         
            No, no.             

37
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,401
       What other options       
          do we have?           

38
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,637
I can't stand                   
that stupid...                  

39
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,240
I say no.                       

40
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,109
No!                             

41
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,987
           Curse you,           
     you wretched monster!      

42
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,292
       No, no, no, wait.        
    Can we talk about this?     

43
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,629
        I don't wanna go        
        in the secret closet.   

44
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,398
       Why is everything        
          such a mess?          

45
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,668
                     No, Star.  
                     No, no, no!

46
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,773
        Oh, hey, Star...        

47
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,575
               It's time for you
               to hide now.     

48
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,447
                 Mystic room    
                 suck transform!

49
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,915
    Food's ready.               

50
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,617
Great. Put it                   
on the table.                   

51
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,118
     Whoa. Why is your room     
           so clean?            

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,020
I have to make                  
a good impression.              

53
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,855
Not a chew toy.                 

54
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,924
I'm not ready.                  
I'm not ready.                  

55
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,826
Can't believe                   
this is happening.              

56
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,161
                 Ready for what?

57
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:50,102
    Being e-v-a-l-u-a-t-e-d.    

58
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,604
          E-v... Ooh!           
           Evaluated.           

59
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,507
Wait, why are we spelling words 
    instead of saying them?     

60
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,876
Yeah, that sounded              
kinda weird when                
it came out of my mouth.        

61
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,611
Anyway, my mom                  
is sending someone              

62
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,680
to see how far along            
in my magic training I am       

63
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,615
since I got to Earth.           
( nervous giggle )              

64
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,117
   That doesn't sound so bad.   

65
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,052
Oh, sweet, simple Marco.        

66
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,722
    - If I fail, I could get    
    sent back to Mewni.         
    - What?!                    

67
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,891
 Which is why I need to clean,  
     and you need to cook.      

68
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,960
                 Whoa!          

69
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,730
           It's her!            

70
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,904
            - Hello.            
         - BOTH: Awww.          

71
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:30,742
      I'm here to evaluate      
     a one Star Butterfly.      

72
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,811
           I'm a one            
        Star Butterfly.         

73
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,680
     And you must be Baby.      

74
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,248
           Oh. Food.            

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,850
  Yes, I prepared this spread   
      for you, Miss Baby.       

76
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,652
    Please help yourself...     

77
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,923
         More, please.          

78
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,258
That took me                    
all day to make.                

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,160
                      Please.   

80
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:52,364
I would love                    
to make you more.               

81
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,566
      So, Your Baby-ness,       

82
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,368
            how does            
     this evaluation work?      

83
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,704
        How do you think        
        it should work?         

84
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,205
       Uh, I don't know.        

85
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,941
   I could show you my room.    

86
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,743
             Okay.              

87
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,945
                     So, this   
                     is my room.

88
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,680
           Really?              

89
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,949
              Oh, yeah, and it's
              pretty much always
              this clean.       

90
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,217
            I'm super organized.

91
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,752
         - What's that?         
         - What's what?         

92
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,455
           Oh, that!            

93
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,856
   You were supposed to hide.   

94
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,958
        Oh, that's just Beanbag.

95
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,393
           Come say hi, Beanbag.

96
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,462
        Beanbag, say hi to Baby.

97
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,932
           Uh, crud.            

98
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,234
       Hmm. Interesting.        

99
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,737
       ( nervous laugh )        
       Uh, yeah. Totally.       

100
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,805
    Hey, maybe we should go     
 downstairs and check on Marco. 

101
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,575
       You know, see how        
     the snacks are coming.     

102
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,876
          What's that?          

103
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,312
          Oh, oh, that.         

104
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,748
      Oh, no. ( chuckles )      

105
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,651
             No, nothing.       
     That's my secret closet.   

106
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,152
            Boring.             

107
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,788
   For things that, you know,   

108
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,591
   I don't want people to...    

109
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,226
        No, wait! Don't!        

110
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,168
          Interesting.          

111
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,905
             You... you think   
             that's interesting?

112
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,907
    Oh, yes.                    

113
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,642
Very interesting.               

114
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,311
               Very interesting.

115
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,179
               Hey, Baby,       
           wanna see my wand?   

116
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:18,016
          Hm. It looks          
 so different from your mom's.  

117
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,918
Yeah, it's cool, right?         

118
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,820
Wait right there.               

119
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,022
I have something                
else to show you.               

120
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,326
You're gonna                    
love it.                        

121
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,861
    This is something I have    
   been working very hard on.   

122
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,431
       My own spell book.       

123
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:35,033
               Oh. That looks   
               interesting, too.

124
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,035
     Really?                    

125
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,704
I made it myself.               

126
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,174
             Huh. Interesting.  

127
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,109
     Yeah, isn't it pretty?     

128
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,877
       I only used, like,       
    five pounds of glitter.     

129
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,746
Who wants                       
refreshments?                   

130
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,816
How's it going?                 

131
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,651
              Interesting.      

132
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,186
What does that mean?            

133
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,854
           I don't know,        
           but go get more food.

134
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,522
Yeah, yeah, okay.               
More food.                      

135
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,025
      Now, Ms. Butterfly,       
   how is your spell casting?   

136
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,060
           My spells?           
       Oh, they're great.       

137
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,662
     My spells are awesome.     

138
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,564
Good.                           

139
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:09,034
Would you bring me              
that apple, please?             

140
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,169
          What apple?           

141
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,672
          - Oh, sure.           
             - No.              

142
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,743
I mean, bring me                
that apple, please,             
with magic.                     

143
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,911
   Oh, right. No, of course.    

144
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,947
      ( blows raspberry )       
             Star.              

145
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,149
         Narwhal blast.         

146
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,554
          - Not quite.          
           - Oh, no?            

147
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,256
     I want a whole apple,      

148
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,992
not an apple                    
with a hole.                    

149
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,927
Try again.                      

150
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:39,331
        Oh! Oh, oh, oh.         
            Gotcha.             

151
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,366
          Oh, totally.          

152
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,901
       No problem at all.       

153
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,936
    Totally. That is totally    
something I am capable of doing.

154
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,605
    Winter storm hyper blow.    

155
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,748
       Did you want that        
     damaged or undamaged?      

156
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,750
        Undamaged it is.        
       Right, of course.        

157
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,918
          Makes sense.          

158
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,988
      Mystic suck portal.       

159
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,767
    All right, that's enough    
           practice.            

160
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,003
         Here it comes.         

161
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,019
      This time for real.       

162
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,690
          Wet ceiling.          

163
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,697
   ( speaking indistinctly )    

164
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,576
        Okay, seriously.        
            I swear.            

165
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:58,977
         I can do this.         

166
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,150
       It just does that        
           sometimes.           

167
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,755
Let me try again.               

168
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,024
       No need. I've seen       
       everything I need to see.

169
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,693
                  Thank you.    

170
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,994
         B-b-but, hey.          

171
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,096
                   How'd I do?  

172
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,031
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.                 
Mm-hmm.                         

173
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,701
Uh, you failed.                 
Good-bye.                       

174
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,804
         What? Failed?          

175
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,940
        So this was all         
     just a waste of time?      

176
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,678
  Princess, would you like me   
          to read you           

177
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,213
         the results of         
         my evaluation?         

178
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,449
 Let's see.                     

179
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,185
Tells me you have               
a closet full of secrets.       

180
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,120
              But what does that
              have to do with...

181
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,956
          While under your care,
          your wand,            

182
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,058
       the single most important
       heirloom of the          
       Butterfly dynasty,       

183
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,194
                     was broken.

184
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,864
      You lost the sacred       
        book of spells,         

185
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,066
      and replaced it with      
   a college-ruled notebook.    

186
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,202
              And lastly,       
              your spell casting

187
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,237
             is so undisciplined
             and unstructured,  

188
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,207
        that you're incapable of
        performing basic magic. 

189
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,009
              You can't even    
              bring me an apple.

190
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,511
     Who wants sandwiches?      

191
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,046
            Get out!            

192
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,150
                  Your Highness,
                   you failed.  

193
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,052
          No, no, no.           

194
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:18,156
If I failed, that means         
I have to go home.              

195
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,325
     That's not my problem.     

196
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,247
             Good-bye, princess.

197
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,244
         It's perfect.          

198
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,313
               Does this mean   
               she gets to stay?

199
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,327
                 Ah! I knew     
                 you'd do great.

200
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,564
         Thanks, Marco.         

201
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,200
           ( sighs )            

202
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:40,338
         Well, she has          
   a closet full of secrets,    

203
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,840
         a broken wand,         

204
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,908
     a notebook containing      
        her own spells,         

205
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,644
      and she doesn't know      
          basic magic.          

206
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,346
    So she failed.              

207
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,148
                            Ow! 

208
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,651
         No, my queen.          

209
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,754
      Star is nowhere near      
  your skill level at her age.  

210
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,822
      She's far beyond it.      

211
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,360
       But I haven't seen       
     anything like this...      

212
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,329
      since Queen Eclipsa.      

213
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,364
         Monster love.          

214
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,400
           ( gasps )            

215
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,178
           ( yells )            

216
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,280
        Not now, puppy.         

217
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,515
           ( yells )            

218
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,052
        I should be safe        
          under here.           

219
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,420
          ( barking )           

220
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,524
             What?              

221
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,359
           ( growls )           

222
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,329
Whee!                           

223
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,365
           ( groans )           

224
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,233
   ( makes shooting noises )    

225
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,336
   I'll get you, tennis ball.   

226
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,372
     Hey, can I borrow your     
      dimensional scissors      
         for a second?          

227
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,574
    - Yeah, sure. Whatever.     
           - Thanks.            

228
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,209
        All right, guys.        

229
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,144
        Who's ready for         
            a walk?             

230
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,581
       Come on, puppies.        

231
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,316
     Whew. Problem solved.      

232
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,053
              Hmm.              

233
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,326
          Here you go.          

234
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,795
              Sir?              

235
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,135
          ( belches )           

236
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,909
      Ah, feels good, man.      

237
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,949
                   So far.      

238
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,687
                      What?     

239
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,125
                  Where did     
                  you get these?

240
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,796
   Seriously, fleshwad. Talk.   

241
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,698
Uh, well,                       

242
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,633
I'm borrowing them              
from a friend                   

243
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,201
who may or may not              
be Star Butterfly.              

244
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,569
                   Wrong answer.

245
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,772
       I'm the forger of        
       all dimensional scissors.

246
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:57,976
 Each pair is made specifically 
 for the entity who earns them. 

247
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,281
Lady, I can't read that.        

248
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,083
                 It's me.       
                 That's my name.

249
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,653
                      Hek-a-poo.
                      Hekapoo.  

250
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,422
             You humans are lame
             times a thousand.  

251
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,757
                      Boop.     

252
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,459
I don't care                    
whose name is on them.          

253
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,761
I borrowed them                 
from Star and I'm               
returning them.                 

254
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,098
     And how do you propose     
 you're going to get them back? 

255
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,434
      Well, I'll earn them      
        like you said...        

256
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,069
                  ( laughing )  

257
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,138
          That's rich.          

258
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,907
I'm serious.                    

259
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,309
I'll have you know              
I have a red belt in karate.    

260
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,111
    This should be amazing.     

261
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,748
    Okay. All you have to do    
    is blow out this flame.     

262
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,550
      Really? No problem.       

263
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,653
          What the...           

264
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,196
That's one.                     

265
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,597
              Hey.              

266
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:54,999
That's two.                     

267
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,434
( laughing )                    

268
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,615
            Bye-bye.            

269
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,728
   HEKAPOO: She doesn't have    
         the scissors,          

270
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,165
    and you're gonna have to    
 blow out a whole lotta flames  

271
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,566
         to find them.          

272
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,134
      Are you looking for       
        these, dum-dum?         

273
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,740
        ( all taunting )        

274
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,276
     Ow! You're burning me      
          a bald spot.          

275
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,859
  I don't have time for this.   

276
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,996
      HEKAPOO: It may take      
         days, months,          

277
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,931
        even lifetimes.         
           ( laughs )           

278
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,233
     I don't think you have     
      the goods to do it.       

279
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:06,704
     Go home to your stinky     
     dirt rock, little boy.     

280
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,439
          I don't care          
       how long it takes.       

281
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,508
  I'm getting those scissors.   

282
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,112
          Oh, dang it.          

283
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,613
       Good boy, Joffrey.       

284
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,548
       Whoa, whoa, whoa!        

285
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,784
     Rainbow diaper blast!      

286
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,219
         Not cool, bub.         

287
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,520
       Take it easy, man.       

288
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,589
       This new dog park        
      is really confusing.      

289
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,124
           Dog park?            

290
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,092
           Oh, Marco!           

291
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,361
         Why did you...         
            Oh, no.             

292
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,363
    He's gone scissor happy.    

293
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,799
        ( dogs barking,         
         girl yelling )         

294
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,235
         Okay, puppies,         
       time to come home.       

295
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:40,104
          ( barking )           

296
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,773
    Oh, Marco, Marco, Marco.    

297
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,408
              Oh!               

298
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,476
  Oh, this does not bode well.  

299
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,979
         ( vibrating )          

300
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,448
           Hey, girl,           
      I'm doing my cardio.      

301
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,418
    Okay, hold up. I'm gonna    
     put it on an incline.      

302
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,719
          Okay, girl,           
          what's good?          

303
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,621
     Okay, so Marco opened      
       a bunch of portals       

304
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,323
    with my scissors and one    
    of them looks like this.    

305
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,625
     <i> Oh, snap, that's bad!</i>     

306
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,926
  Yeah, that's what I thought.  

307
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,795
   <i> The red portal is Hekapoo.</i>  

308
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,497
 <i> You need to get away from it,</i> 
        <i> and if she asks,</i>       

309
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,633
  <i> you do not tell her you got</i>  
 <i> those scissors from me, okay?</i> 

310
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,169
    Wait. I thought Hekapoo     
    gave you those scissors.    

311
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,471
     <i> I mean, yeah, she left</i>    
  <i> the scissors in the bathroom</i> 

312
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,507
     <i> at the Bounce Lounge,</i>     
     <i> and what happened then</i>    

313
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,577
   <i> was I took them, so yeah,</i>   
    <i> basically, they're mine.</i>   

314
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,113
        What? No, Pony,         
        that's stealing.        

315
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:25,516
      <i> Uh, I'm pretty sure</i>      
     <i> that's called finding.</i>    

316
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,584
 Okay, so is Marco in trouble?  

317
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,487
         <i> You know what?</i>        
      <i> He's probably dead.</i>      

318
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,990
       <i> That Hekapoo chick</i>      
         <i> is crazy, man.</i>        

319
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,692
      Oh, boy. All right,       
 I'll talk to you later, girl.  

320
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,094
            Bye-eee!            

321
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,495
       I'm coming, Marco.       

322
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,733
       ( raucous squawk )       

323
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,114
                    ( sneezes ) 

324
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,915
       - Dude, watch it.        
            - Sorry.            

325
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,688
Oh, incoming!                   

326
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,798
       Oh, dude, it's on.       

327
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,701
            Hey-yah!            

328
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,638
             Ha ha!             

329
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,073
            Oh, man.            

330
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,421
  So it all comes down          
        to this.                

331
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,924
Sixteen years.                  

332
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,759
A lot of clones.                

333
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:45,763
Seemed to go by...              
( snaps fingers ) like that.    

334
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,599
I finally tracked               
you down, Hekapoo.              

335
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,568
          Yep, it's the real me.

336
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,903
           No more clones, so...

337
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,572
    Who's a little boy now?     

338
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,608
          This is the part where
          you blow out my flame?

339
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,712
       Ha. You barely escaped me
       on the exploding         
       plains of Flendar.       

340
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,016
   When I lost your trail in    
  the mist of the Never Zone,   

341
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,085
           I thought            
      I'd never find you.       

342
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:10,354
   After spending a few years   
    infiltrating a cloister     
           of monks,            

343
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,789
 I acquired some ancient texts  

344
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,891
        which led me to         
      dimensional scholars      

345
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,627
   who taught me to translate   
        their language.         

346
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,630
After that, it was              
a simple matter of surviving    

347
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:23,434
the Afflicted Forest            
and ending up right             
at your door.                   

348
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,874
            Not bad for a human.

349
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,709
    You truly earned these.     

350
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,744
           I underestimated you.

351
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,280
    Hekapoo, where's Marco?     

352
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,281
             Star!              

353
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,550
          ( groaning )          

354
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,420
               Unhand me,       
          beautiful stranger.   

355
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,654
        How do you know my name?

356
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,623
It's me, Marco.                 
See?                            

357
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,425
            Marco?!             

358
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,128
             Marco!             

359
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,830
        Oh, man, we have        
    so much to catch up on.     

360
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,832
        I've learned how        
       to sword fight...        

361
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,735
       ( Marco continues        
         indistinctly )         

362
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,105
        Then I jet-skied        
        off a waterfall.        

363
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,673
       - Isn't that cool?       
            - What?             

364
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,742
       Oh, check it out!        

365
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,177
      It took me 16 years,      

366
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,678
      but I totally earned      
        these scissors.         

367
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,847
        Wait, 16 years?         

368
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,116
  You've been gone from Earth   
   for, like, eight minutes.    

369
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,619
         Eight minutes?         

370
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,654
   Yeah, I forgot to tell you   
  that time passes differently  

371
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,423
       in this dimension.       
           Not sorry.           

372
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,958
                   No, no, no.  
                   This is good.

373
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,628
            It means you haven't
            missed anything     
            back on Earth.      

374
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,630
 Come on. Use your new scissors 
        to take us home.        

375
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,131
Yeah, about that.               

376
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,000
         I don't think          
        I'm coming back.        

377
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,369
    Turns out I really like     
       my new life here.        

378
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,504
        I got my sword,         
        my dragon cycle.        

379
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,306
  I get to ride around all day  
      and go on adventures      

380
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,774
        whenever I want.        

381
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,509
       It's the journey,        
           you know.            

382
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,878
    Yeah, that dragon cycle     
        is really dope.         

383
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,147
        No, wait, wait.         

384
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,682
    What about your parents,    

385
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,852
       or your friends...       
             or me?             

386
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,501
       Don't look at me.        

387
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,869
 Those scissors are yours now.  

388
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,471
     You can come back here     
       any time you want.       

389
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,877
  Please. Take care of Nachos   
        while I'm gone.         

390
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,345
She's in good hands.            

391
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,480
        Adios, boo-boo.         

392
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:20,151
  Well, old friend, you really  
  gave me a run for my money.   

393
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,352
           Likewise.            

394
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,887
You're pretty cool.             
( laughs )                      

395
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,488
            Thanks.             

396
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,924
             - Bye.             
        - Later, H-poo.         

397
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,059
Don't call me that!             

398
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,761
         ( yells ) Oh.          

399
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,598
No! My hot bod!                 

400
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,266
Where did it go?                

401
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,101
                 Squish.        

402
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,270
        Oh, I guess you're back 
        on Earth's timeline now.

403
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:41,072
                But look on     
                the bright side.

404
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,873
                 You still have 
                 your bald spot.

405
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,244
  Seriously?! That's the thing  
     that stayed the same?      

406
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,745
      ( Hekapoo laughing )      

407
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,747
You got the mark                
of Hekapoo, son!                

408
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,582
Okay, bye-bye.                  

409
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,885
               Hey, who cares if
               you're 14 again? 

410
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,555
         That just means we have
         more time to go on     
         adventures together.   

411
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,458
         Especially now that you
         have your own scissors.

412
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,127
Yeah, I guess                   
you're right.                   

413
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,696
            Of course I am.     
            Now I'm gonna go    
            make us some nachos.

414
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,542
          "Password"?           

415
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,679
        I don't remember        
          my password.          

416
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,016
           ( sighs )            

417
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,656
        Mmm. Still warm.        

418
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,924
           ( barking            
        and whimpering )        

419
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:37,662
           All right.           
      Let's go for a walk.
