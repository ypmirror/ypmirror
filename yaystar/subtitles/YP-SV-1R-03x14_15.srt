it's all right. It's just Marco.

42
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,931
            I'm not an intruder.
            King River said     
            I could be a knight.

43
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,867
  See?                          
  I got the cape and everything.

    - ( all laughing )          

46
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,653
           Ugh, River.          
           I'm so confused here.

47
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,789
           You told Marco       
           he could be a knight?

48
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,291
Well, uh, yeah.                 

49
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,128
I never actually thought        
we'd see him again. Ha ha!      

50
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,532
I'm sorry, Marco, but I'm afraid
that's not how it works.        

51
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,667
         But King River         
    gave me a knight's cape.    

52
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,269
          M for Mewni.          

53
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,272
No, my boy,                     
that's my meat blanket.         

54
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,274
        - Meat blanket?         
        - Yes.                  

55
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,677
 - I also have a cheese doily.  
 - ( sighs )                    

56
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,812
     But I wore this thing      
           every day.           

57
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,549
      For weeks. Weeks...       

58
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,150
               I'm sorry, Marco,

59
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,286
but becoming a knight           
is no easy task.                

60
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,556
      Yes. It takes years       
      of intense training, dear.

61
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,225
Yeah.                           
Years of intense training.      

62
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,662
 - He hasn't even been a squire.
 - A squire?                    

63
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,530
      Hey, I can do that.       

64
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,233
   River, are any of our knights
   in need of a squire?         

65
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,869
Wait, I've got it.              
How about we set him up         

66
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,537
with Sir Pop Lock and Dropeth?  
Hmm?                            

67
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,306
   That old scamp!              

68
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,876
  ( whispering ) Um, actually,  
  he "pop, locked, and dropped".

69
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,411
    You mean...?                

70
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,246
     Oh, my.                    

71
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,082
       Star, why don't you      
       have Marco stay with you?

72
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,517
            It will give you two
            a chance to catch up

73
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,586
       while we figure this out.

74
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,853
       Wait, wait, wait.        

75
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,855
        I know a knight         
       he can squire for.       

76
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,391
Man, Star. I'm sorry.           

77
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,894
I feel like I just              
crash landed into your life.    

78
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,330
        Well, we figured it out.

79
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,333
Yeah... um, cool.               

80
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:26,204
      Wow, heh. Check out       
      all these stairs.         
      Sure are a lot.           

81
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,341
So, what does Jackie            
think about all this?           

82
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:35,780
Oh, well, she wasn't            
really into it, but you know me.

83
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:40,352
Ain't nobody telling me         
what to do. ( chuckles )        

84
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,355
That-that was a joke.           

85
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,293
Actually, yeah,                 
she-she broke up with me.       

86
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,763
             Well,              
   I'm very sorry about that.   

87
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,799
So, are you and Tom--           

88
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,735
                         Yep!   

89
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,404
   Oh, look, here's that door   
      we were walking to.       

90
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,742
      ( Lavabo laughing )       

91
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,410
           Found you!           

92
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,414
Ah, here's our guy,             
Sir Lavabo. Hi!                 

93
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,883
         Ah, princess.          

94
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,285
     I will be with you shortly.

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,786
    I have a job to finish.     

96
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:19,457
There. Every sock in the kingdom
       now has its mate.        

97
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,593
        How may I be of service?

98
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,829
    Well, I...                  
    I got you a squire.         

99
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,830
           ( gasps )            

100
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,333
         My own squire?         

101
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,801
     What do you call him?      

102
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,470
         - Marco Diaz.          
         - What?                

103
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,773
I'm squiring                    
for the laundry guy?            

104
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:38,410
       Yeah. This is Sir Lavabo.
       He's super cool.         

105
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,945
But I'd be way down here        
in the basement.                

106
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,415
         Actually, sub-basement.

107
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,917
     So moody.                  
     You're gonna love it.      

108
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,620
Yeah, but, just the same,       

109
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,489
how about you princess me up    
something a little closer,      

110
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,459
           like, say,           
    something in the castle?    

111
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,828
       Marco, just 'cause       
         I'm a princess         

112
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,363
          doesn't mean          
   I can do anything I want.    

113
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,831
Yeah, but if I'm                
all the way down here,          

114
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,934
we're never even                
gonna see each other.           

115
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,469
                 ( growls )     

116
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,504
You don't appreciate            
anything I do!                  

117
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,475
    Star, wait. I didn't mean...

118
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,145
       Marco Diaz, are you ready
       for your first quest?    

119
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,648
    Yeah... sure.               

120
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,949
What are we doing?              

121
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,686
               You must empty   
               the lint catcher.

122
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,655
( mocking Marco )               
"Oh, hey Star!"                 

123
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,889
       "I just showed up        
       out of nowhere."         

124
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,291
     "Why don't you give me     
         a job to do?"          

125
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,892
   Okay, Marco, here's a job.   

126
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,761
       "No, not that job!       
   Another job--" ( groans )    

127
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,233
          Hello.                

128
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,469
            Eclypsa.            

129
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,670
              They're giving you
              some outdoor time.

130
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,971
                That's great.   

131
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,842
            I know.             
  And real dragon chains,too.   

132
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,878
   ( sighs ) They make a lady   
         feel so free.          

133
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,014
          Oh, yeah, that's, uh, 
          that's really awesome.

134
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,884
         Can I sit?             
         Sit, like, right there?

135
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,353
       ( grunts )               

136
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,055
             ( exhales )        
             Thanks.            

137
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,025
Here, take a load off.          
Feed the birds.                 

138
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,861
Always makes me feel better.    

139
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,929
     I don't get how some people
     think it's okay            

140
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,831
     to just drop into your life

141
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,334
                 without so much
                 as a head's up.

142
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,102
       You know what I'm saying?

143
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,904
                And then you try
                to help him out,

144
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,107
                no appreciation.

145
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,343
So, what's his name?            

146
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,944
                   Huh? What?   

147
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,513
             No, no, no, no, no,
             it's not like that.

148
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,947
        Well, well, not anymore.

149
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,950
       - It's just Marco.       
       - Well, Marco.           

150
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,018
   So, that's it.               

151
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,353
               Marco thinks that

152
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,188
                 just because   
                 I'm a princess,

153
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,057
          I can get him         
          whatever job he wants.

154
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,294
     Well, can't you?           

155
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,698
       No... yes.               
       But that's not the point.

156
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,569
Well, now that he's here,       
do you want him to stay?        

157
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,939
                 Uh, yeah... no.

158
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,609
          Ugh, I don't know.    
          Doesn't matter anyway.

159
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,712
              I already made him
              a laundry squire. 

160
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,982
He's squiring                   
for the knight of the wash?     

161
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,085
Well, then your problem         
will take care of itself, dear. 

162
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
   What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,656
No squire has ever survived     

164
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,558
more than a day                 
in the laundry room.            

165
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,160
It's the most dangerous place   
in the castle.                  

166
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,396
   ( gasps ) Marco! I got to go.

167
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,664
         Thanks for the popcorn.

168
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,166
 That wasn't popcorn.           

169
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,634
Lavabo, where's Marco?          

170
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,002
             On his first quest,

171
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,038
 cleaning out the lint catcher, 
           mi' lady.            

172
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,009
Oh, no.                         
Sparkle slushie juice blast!    

173
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,178
Wait, princess!                 

174
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,148
      Marco?                    

175
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,018
        Whoa!                   

176
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,221
      ( blows raspberry )       

177
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,058
        That was weird.         

178
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,797
Marco! There you are.           

179
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,666
        No, don't.              
        You're gonna wake it up.

180
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,102
         - What?                
         - No, I said.          

181
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,204
Don't. You're gonna wake it up. 

182
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,772
             What?              

183
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,876
       ( sighs ) I said,        
  you're going to wake it up.   

184
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,013
         ( slithering )         

185
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,020
         ( screeching )         

186
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,121
            - Whoa!             
             - Ugh!             

187
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,292
           Whoa! Aah!           

188
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,560
              Aah!              

189
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,229
Rolling thunder lightning blast!

190
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,831
              Aah!              

191
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,065
           ( grunts )           

192
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,834
          ( shrieks )           

193
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:23,835
              No!               

194
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,303
       ( Star screaming )       

195
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,704
           ( grunts )           

196
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,639
             Marco!             

197
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,040
          ( belches )           

198
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,476
              Huh?              

199
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,143
          ( belches )           

200
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,678
         ( both grunt )         

201
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,213
Marco, are you okay?            

202
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,848
                We gotta get    
                that fan moving.

203
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,150
      ( monster rumbling )      

204
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,685
       ( Marco grunting )       

205
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,689
             Hiya!              

206
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,890
           ( grunts )           

207
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,225
                 It won't budge!

208
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,593
     Wiggle harder!             

209
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,028
          ( rumbling )          

210
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,529
I'm coming, Marco.              

211
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,865
         - Ha, gotcha!          
            - Whoa!             

212
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,902
     ( monster screaming )      

213
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,375
            Fantastic exit beam!

214
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,110
             - Aah!             
             - Aah!             

215
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,512
         ( both grunt )         

216
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,714
                         LAVABO:
                         Bravo! 

217
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,115
                    Fantastique!

218
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,519
  Only one other squire         
  has survived the lint catcher.

219
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,753
                             Me!

220
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,123
   Marco Diaz, you will make    
         a fine squire          

221
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,925
  for the knights of the wash.  

222
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,193
( chuckles ) Great.             

223
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,095
   Thanks, I guess.             

224
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,797
             Uh, Lavabo, can you
             give us a sec?     

225
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,298
                 I need to talk 
                 to Marco alone.

226
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,300
     As you wish, Princess.     

227
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,303
             Long live the wash.

228
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,805
            ( sighs )           
            Okay, listen, Marco.

229
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,206
               Here's the thing.

230
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,242
      A lot has changed         
      in my life since you left.

231
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,412
       It's complicated,        
       but I finally figured out

232
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,749
    that I just need to be      
    the best princess I can now.

233
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,952
           And with you here    
           it's really hard to--

234
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,988
Yeah, yeah.                     
I totally get it.               

235
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,789
It was a crazy bad idea         
for me to do this               

236
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,324
without giving you              
a heads up.                     

237
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,560
I'll go back to Earth.          

238
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,662
        That's not what I meant.

239
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:02,133
Okay, can I, uh,                
take my hands                   
off my face, please?            

240
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,169
I feel like I'm gonna           
run into something.             

241
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,604
                     Okay, stop.

242
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,172
              This is the place.

243
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,508
    Sparkle glitter bomb expand.

244
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,512
         Okay, you can look now.

245
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,249
              Wow.              

246
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,351
            Is that... ( gasps )

247
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,120
             What?              

248
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,755
            No way!             

249
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,757
I can't believe it!             

250
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,691
     ( puppies whimpering )     

251
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,961
            My room!            

252
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,996
( gasps )                       
All my stuff!                   

253
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,164
My galactic kung fu doll.       

254
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,867
( gasps )                       
This is so great!               

255

              Marco, kneel.     

256
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,203

Uh, what?                       

257
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,305
          Marco, sit.           

258
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,342
What are-are you doing?         

259
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,177
              ( clears throat ) 
              Head down, please.

260
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,947
      I hereby declare that you,

261
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,817
              Marco Ubaldo Diaz,
              shall henceforth  

262
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,220
             be my royal squire,
             to stay by my side 

263
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,056
               in times of peace
               or danger,       

264
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:01,159
          as my most trusted    
          confidant and advisor.

265
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,295
       To go clubbing with me   
       even when he's too tired,

266
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,798
              to share his      
              late night nachos,

267
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:11,235
       but most importantly     
       to be my very best friend

268
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,404
              so long as we both
              shall live.       

269
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,373
                     Amen.      

270
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,207
                  Do you accept?

271
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,243
             I do.              

272
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,849
Wait, do princesses             
even have squires?              

273
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,185
           I'm a princess.      
           I can do what I want.

274
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,855
 <i> Attention, Quest Buy shoppers,</i>

275

278
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,765
         Marco, this is gonna be
         so much fun!           

279
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,567
    Just a squire and his knight

280
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:46,437
          shopping, pop-locking,
          shop-locking.         

281
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,839
               You know,        
               you feel me, bro.

282
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,373
I know that looked like it hurt.

283
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,943
            Oh, it did,         
            but I'll feel better

284
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,545
              as soon as we find
              this little beauty

285
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,748
     from the Quest Buy catalog.

286
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,216
         I've always wanted one!

287
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,419
Sorry, Star, but that's         
not on the list.                

288
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,723
       Boom!                    

289
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,892
       BABY-MAN:                
       Wow, that's so organized.

290
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,062
          Look, it's got coupons
          attached to it.       

291
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,263
            I like a coupon.    

292
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,465
( chuckles )                    
Hey, guys.                      

293
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,034
         Oh, hey, man.          
        I dig your list.        

294
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,470
Thanks.                         
It's every sale item            
of the Squire Blowout           

295
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,472
grouped together                
by aisle and availability.      

296
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,441
I called ahead to check         
the inventory on each item.     

297
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,709
       That's cool.             

298
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,811
    A great squire is           
    an organized squire.        

299
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,912
That's what I always say.       

300
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,148
           Uh, great.           

301
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,949
            Squire!             

302
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,651
           I'm Higgs.           
        That's Baby-Man.        

303
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,419

         - He's Marco.          

306
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,724
      This is his first blowout.

307
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,126
              Really? Huh.      
              I would've thought
              you a veteran

                 list of yours. 

309
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,463
Nope.                           
I don't know anything at all.   

310
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,497
                      Heh, nice.

311
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,933
            Well, welcome to the
            community, Marco.   

312
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,235

         - I'm honored.         

313
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,404
        Oh, uh, just a little   
        squire to squire advice,

            most important task.

            the good stuff fast.

317
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,745
              The shelves       
              clear out quickly.

318
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,146
I plan on it.                   

319
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,015
         So, where are          
       y'alls knights at?

         Oh, they're over there.

321
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,352
            That's Lady Whosits.
            Baby-Man's knight.  

322
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,355

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,660
       And Old Man's knight,

           Oh, cool.            

331
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,976
   Duty calls.                  
   See you at the starting line.

332
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,145
            - Nerd.             
            - Okay.             

333
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,447
Did she just                    
call me a nerd?                 

334
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,815
                    ( chuckles )
                    No.         

335
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,452
                  Endearing nerd
                  or something. 

336
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,620

                   I don't know.

               let's get a cart.

338
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,860
My lady, choose your steed.     

339
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:54,866
             No. No.            
             Oh, in your dreams.

340
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,869

             Item number one is,
             uh, a chest plate. 

369
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,864
          We need a chest plate.

370
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,032
               It's on aisle    
               eight point nine.

371
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,233
Eight point nine,               
got it.                         

372
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,135
Yee-haw!                        

373
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,104
Got mine!                       

374
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,641
( grunts )                      
I got mine.                     

375
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,476
I goo-goo got mine.             

376
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,078
          Hey, there's one left.

377
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,080
Almost forgot.                  

378
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,482
Have fun wearing my face.       

379
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,084
         Ha ha!                 

380
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,920
           That Baby-Man ruined 
           the last chest plate.

381
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,489
           I knew those squires 
           were up to something.

382
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,725
       They don't want me       
    to have the good stuff.     

383
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,494
       - Marco, I don't--       
      - Yes, I see it now.      

384
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,829
I think you're making them out--

385
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,131
          I've got it!          
      We'll outsmart them.      

386
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,900
  We'll just go out of order.   

387
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,335
   That way we can get ahead.   

388
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,736
      Marco, chill.             

389
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,138
I don't even wear chest plates. 

390
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,441
    I just wanna                
    salvage my plan, that's all.

391
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:46,878
         A great squire         
         is an organized squire.

392
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,318
Yes! We've beat                 
the other squires to it.        

393
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,554
                ( gasps )       
                I want that one!

394
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,490
Uh, oh, uh.                     

395
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,660
     Actually, Star, I did      
     the research on these guys,

396
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,328
 and it came down to these two. 

397
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,663
    They each ranked highest    
         in their class         

398
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,099
    on safety, growth rate,     
     a knight horse power.      

399
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,633
 This one comes with an airbag. 

400
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,868
       So either of these       
        should be good.         

401
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,970
           Oh, okay.            

402
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,307
 Well, I guess the airbag one.  

403
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,543
         - Good choice.         
      - ( horse squeaks )       

404
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,113
Okay, since we're right near    
the dragon repellant,           

405
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,581
I think we should--             

406
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,720
Hey, that's our                 
starter horse!                  

407
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,789
What?                           
I didn't take your horse.       

408
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,725
    I just saw you take it.     
       Now give it back.        

409
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,695
Higgs, did you take             
their starter horse?            

410
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,730
           No, siree.           
            Unh-unh.            

411
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,633
   Are you calling my squire    
            a liar?             

412
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,336
                   Uh, yes?     

413
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,304
If you're calling               
my squire a liar...             

414
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,374
          - Oh, whoa!           
- Then you're calling me a liar!

415
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,510
     Ugh, whatever, stabby dude.

416
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,711
               Take the horse.  
               We don't need it.

417
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,748
Very well.                      

418
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,551
      ( blows raspberry )       

419
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,585
Can you believe her?            

420
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,054
          It's all right, Marco.

421
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,656
              I'll just pick out
              another... one.   

422
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,226
       Ha ha!                   
       Peace!                   

423
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,761
Are you serious?                

424
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,930
               It's okay, Marco.

425
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,366
          Listen, let's just    
          get back to your list.

426
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,500
   Look, look, look, look, look.

427
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,668
   There's the dragon repellant.

428
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,203
            We need that, right?

429
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,305
    ( sighs )                   
    Yeah.                       

430
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,678
               Ugh, yep,        
               that's the stuff.

431
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,113
                        HIGGS:  
                        Yoo-hoo!

432
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,052
     - ( dragons growling )     
           - Oh, no.            

433
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,221
      ( dragons growling,       
       Marco screaming )        

434
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,590
 <i> Apparently, we've got dragons</i> 

435
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,794
    <i> on aisle 14.2... again.</i>    

436
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,730
          Shoo. Shoo.           

437
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,900
           ( sighs )            
   This is not my department.   

438
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,636
           ( coughs )           

439
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,238
      Uh, please get off.       

440
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,640
          ( coughing )          

441
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,942
         Uh, whoopsie.          

442
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,410
 Did you mean to get this one?  

443
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:03,414
         Easy mistake.          
     They look so similar.      

444
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,149
          ( growling )          

445
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,818
       You wanna tell me why    
       you're being such a jerk?

446
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,055
Listen, wannabe, you think      
it's easy being a squire?       

447
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,892
All of my waking hours          
I'm weaving chain mail,         
sharpening swords.              

448
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,627
I'm always at my knight's       
beck and call.                  

449
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,630
I've even learned how to        
polish armor in my sleep.       

450
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,632
But what did you do             
to earn this job?               

451
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,068
Oh, nothing.                    
It was handed to you            

452
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,903
because you're the              
princess' boyfriend.            

453
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,105
    What? I'm not her boyfriend.

454
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,740
Interesting.                    

455
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,344
Guess it was handed to you      
out of pity, then, huh?         

456
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,146
           ( growls )           
             Star!              

457
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,581
            - Marco!            
       - I'm here, Star.        

458
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,483
    - Under the dragon butt.    
             - Oh.              

459
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,652
                Scram, lizard.  
                Sk-Sk-Skidaddle!

460
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,522
               Well, I think    
               that's enough fun
               for one squire.  

461
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,123
             What say we call it
             a day, Marco?      

462
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,658
         The sale's almost over,
         anyway.                

463
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,828
No! There's still               
one thing left                  
on my list, Star.               

464
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,430
Armor wax.                      
There's just one bottle left.   

465
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,865
I called ahead to check.        

466
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,268
We have to get it               
before those other squires.     

467
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,003
          Uh, Marco, no offense,

468
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,704
              but you're looking
              kinda sweaty.     

469
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,206
       Like sweatier than usual.

470
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,774
          Hey, maybe let's just,
          you know--            

471
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,410
       - Mount the cart!        
            - Okay!             

472
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,014
  ( gasps )                     

473
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,017
    Don't let them get that!    

474
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,852
       ( both laughing )        

475
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,795
          ( shrieks )           
             Marco!             

476
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,064
              Aah!              
         Oh, that's it!         

477
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,699
              Aah!              

478
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,868
                            Aah!

479
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,509
           ( laughs )           
              Yes!              

480
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,011
          ( groaning )          

481
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,747
            - Marco!            
            - What?             

482
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,816
          ( groaning )          

483
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,519
Oh, I didn't trip her           
that hard.                      

484
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,721
What? She's faking it.          

485
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,756
                       ( sighs )
                       Here.    

486
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,091
Ha, ha-ha!                      

487
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,893
Thanks for the wax, losers!     

488
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,328
Let's check out.                

489
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,198
Dude, you have                  
got to chill.                   

490
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,766
                      What? Why?

491
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,369
      I'm just trying to get you
      the best stuff.           

492
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,873
              I'm sorry.        

493
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,709
            I just really wanted
            to show everyone    

494
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,278
         that I was truly worthy
         of being your squire.  

495
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,914
               But maybe I'm not
               cut out for this.

496
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,917
          Why did you appoint me
          as your squire        
          in the first place?   

497
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,385
             I'm terrible at it.

498
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,553
      I didn't get you any gear,

499
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,121
                and you're gonna
                look like a joke

500
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,923
              in front of all   
              the other knights.

501
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,795
Okay, first of all,             
I am a princess.                

502
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,797
So I'm gonna look great         
no matter what.                 

503
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,900
Second, I knew how excited you  
were about coming back to Mewni 

504
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,702
so I bent the rules a little.   

505
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,738
I'm a princess,                 
not a knight.                   

506
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,773
I don't need the stuff          
actual knights need.            

507
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,742
I've got, like,                 
a magic wand.                   

508
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,610
The whole point                 
of making you my squire         

509
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,811
was so we could                 
hang out again                  

510
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,313
and just do silly stuff.        

511
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,949
 <i> Attention, Quest Buy shoppers,</i>

512
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,584
    <i> only one minute remains</i>    

513
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,587

514
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,289
             All right, come on.

515
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,923
   Huh? But wait, wait, wait.   

516
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,892
     Marco, I just told you     
       I don't need the--       

517
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,127
        I know, I know.         

518
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,728
            Come on.            

519
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,829
     ( indistinct chatter )     

520
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:10,467
Got you this                    
really shiny shield.            

521
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,470
               Not shiny enough.

522
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,776
    ( gasps )                   
    It's beautiful!             

523
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,912
  Hey, Marco, I challenge you   
          to a duel...          

524
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,847
      A duel of silliness!      

525
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,983
    I accept your challenge!    

526
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,286
      ( both exclaiming )       

527
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,655
    Hey, what do they think     
         they're doing?         

528
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,990
    That's not knight gear.     

529
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,426
       That's just silly,       
       random, fun stuff.       

530
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,429
             - Ugh.             
        - Clever squire.        

531
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,165
      Salami.                   
      I'd never see that coming.

532
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,533
           ( groans )           

533
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,968
Uh, did you really mean to grab 

534
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,639
     two of these defective     
         happy gnomes?
