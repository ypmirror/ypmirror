Oh, yeah, I got you, girl.      
Watch this.                     

127
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,265
           Excuse me!           
 Some last-minute announcement! 

128
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,601
    So, as all of you know,     
       fall is coming up.       

129
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,938
   Okay, so let's take a vote   
    on our new spooky robes.    

130
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,941
        The first color         
 we're gonna vote on is maroon. 

131
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,343
          Yea or nay?           

132
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,012
          All for yea,          
        show your hands.        

133
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,683
         O-Okay, so we          
     just not a hot ticket.     

134
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,386
          That's fine.          
We just have one for yea. Okay. 

135
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,623
All right, Tom, just what       
do you think you're do--?       

136
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,893
    -Oh, you look so nice!      
    -What are you doing here?   

137
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,030
I'm here to stop you from making
a terrible, terrible mistake!   

138
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,032
If this is just another way     
to get my attention, you--      

139
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,033
        Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. 

140
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,501
        I don't know            
        what Pony told you,     

141
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,002
        but it's                
        not what you think.     

142
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,071
        I genuinely want this.  

143
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,039
        What?                   

144

            I need to change.   

145
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,244
            You're here being   
            the best princess   
            you can be,         

146
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,079
            and it's            
            really inspiring.   

147
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,148
        It's time for me        
        to be a better prince.  

148
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,717
Yeah, but whatever's            
going on out there              

149
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,153
looks creepy                    
and dangerous.                  

150
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,088
        I'm the prince          
        of the underworld, okay?

151
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,691
        This is gonna be        
        an easy procedure       
        for a guy like me.      

152
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,925
               In and out!

        the skulls, the fire--  

155
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,897
            it's just for show. 

156
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,566
So, you're just gonna zap       
all your personality away       

157
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,068
so you can feel good            
about yourself?                 

158
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,937
        No! I have problems,    
        and this is the only way

159
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,174
        to get rid of them!     
        Ow! See? Problems!      

160
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,376
You don't have to be            
like this, Tom!                 

161
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,779
        Yeah, well, I've        
        already made up my mind,

162
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,180
            and you're not      
            gonna stop me.      

163
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,581
Fine, be that way!              

164
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,283
But I am not gonna stay here    

165
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,918
and watch you                   
do this to yourself.            

166
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,254
            I didn't invite     
            you, anyway, so...  

167

                Gah! Of course! 

169
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,927
     Also, who is bringing      
   what to the potluck, okay?   

170
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,762
   Because I don't wanna see    
       nothing but chips.       

171
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,364
            Come on,            
            we're outta here.   

172
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,566
All right, y'all, thank you     
so much for your time!

174

      Brethren, this world      
         is in danger.          

175
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,117
       There is a blight        
       that plagues it.         

176
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,919
      Of course, we dream       
        of a world pure         

177

00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,156

          is infected,          

179
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,892
    then the entire harvest     
          is at risk.           

180
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,028
      Bring forth the son       
         of the blight.

           Wow. Hard to believe 
           that one little demon

243
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,410
            was the source      
            of so much rage!    

244
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,946
    What? No, no.               
    No, no, no.                 

245
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,349
You still got thousands         
of these little guys inside.    

246
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,519
We're gonna have to start you   
     on a 13-year plan.         

247
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,521
             -What?             
  -Yeah, this is all gonna be   

248
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,290
   a long and painful process   
         for all of us,         

249
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,126
          but you were          
     such a good boy today,     

250
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,695
     you can help yourself      
        to just one toy         

251
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,331
      from the toy chest.       

252
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,767
                Oh, no. No!     
                No, no!         

253
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,169
        I'm gonna be            
        an evil demon forever!  

254
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,706
The important thing is that     
you want to improve yourself!   

255
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,910
You can still do that           
with a bunch of those           
little guys inside of you.      

256
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,715
     So, should we go again     
         next weekend?          

257
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,186
       No. This is not worth it.

258
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,854
Well, if you're                 
not coming back,                

259
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,358
you'd better make               
that one toy count.             

260
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,727
So, still up                    
for that corn shake?            

261
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,829
        Yeah, that'd be cool.   

262
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,166
    [gasps] You two have got    
       to be kidding me.        

263
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,578
            Oh, no.             

264
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,846
Hey, there, big guy.            

265
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,314
                Hey, Mama!      

266
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,217
So, you're ready                
for the new school year?        

267
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,586
        Yep. Still getting used 
        to Earth life, though.  

268
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,154
                    [slurps ]   

269
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,191
Hmm. I see you're still         
wearing your cape.              

270
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,359
                Of course.      
                I'm a knight!   

271
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,662
Did I ever tell you             
about my friend                 

272
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,430
who spent a summer              
in France?                      

273
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,934
In France,                      
everything was better--         

274
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,403
the arthouse films,             
the fashion, the croissants.    

275
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,438
She said it just like that--    
"croissant."                    

276
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,740
Who does that?                  

277
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,608
            Wow, your friend    
            sounds annoying.    

278
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,344
It was me, Marco.               
"Croissant."                    

279
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,447
            Oh! [chuckles]      
            But... come on!     

280
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,950
            I'm not annoying.   
            I just wear a cape. 

281
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,386
Look, I'm sure everybody        
on Moony wore a cape.           

282
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,389
       Mewni.                   
       It's pronounced "Mew-ni."

283
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,391
Marco,                          
I'm just trying to help.        

284
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,394
    And I'm just trying to help 
    you properly say "Mewni."   

285
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:14,432
Croissant! Croissant!           
It's pronounced "croissant!"    

286
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,701
                Hey, no!        
                No, no, no!     

287
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,402
     I'm not the croissant girl!

288
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,704
            I earned this cape, 

289
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,940
            and by golly,       
            I'm gonna wear it!  

290
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,109
Good for you, Marco.            
The cape looks cool.            

291
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,744
                Thanks, Dad.    

292
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,114
You are chained to the wall     
of Azgorth's dungeon            

293
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,883
surrounded by his feral imps,   

294
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,719
and only one holds the key      
to your freedom.                

295
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,721
  -What's in our surroundings?  
           -Nothing.            

296
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,322
    I try and break the chains. 

297
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,291
The imps eat your hands.        

298
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,659
        Aah!                    

299
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,127
         I cast a healing spell!

300
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,130
      -The imps eat your hands. 
               -Marco!          

301
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,065
            Oh, um...           
            use the butter.     

302
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,600
        What? There's no butter!

303
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,002
        Didn't you hear         
      what she just said?       

304
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,470
        There's nothing         
      in our surroundings!      

305
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,671
     Put it on the chains,      

306
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,306
      slide your hands out,     
        hide in the vents!      

307
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:59,110
        This isn't Mewni, Marco!
        It's not going to work. 

308
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,945
It worked.                      
You're free.                    

309
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,114
       Oh! Oh! Next we go       
           find Ludo,           

310
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,350
      say the Whispering Spell, 
           destroy Toffee!      

311
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,653
  No! This                      
isn't Mewni!                    

312
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,588
Yeah, you destroy Toffee,       
save Mewni.                     

313
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,524
Congratulations!                

314
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,193
Oh, no, no, no, no,             
    no, no, no!                 

315
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,328
            It's okay, Ferguson!
            It's just a game!   

316
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,931
         No. On Mewni,          
    this actually happened!     

317
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,933
     They made me a knight!     

318
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,301
          [door slams]          

319
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,170
    Where-- Where did Ferguson  
    and Alfonso go?             

320
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,171
They left.                      

321
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,306
                    What? Why?  

322
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,473
Oh, they just get annoyed       

323
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,975
when you talk                   
about Mewni all the time.       

324
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,410
It's no big deal.               

325
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,712
            What?               

326
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,347
       All right, sensei,       

327
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,449
 just be straight with me, man. 

328
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,384
Am I annoying when I talk       
about Mewni?                    

329
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,986
           Of course not, Marco.

330
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,355
        You had a life-changing 
        experience on Mewni,    

331
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,790
             and it changed you.

332
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,658
Yeah,  that's right.            

333
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,727
          And it changed me too.

334
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,562
                     [chortling]
                     Look at it!

335
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,464
               Look at it, yeah!

336
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,500
Ohh, ohh, it's a--              
it's a cape.                    

337
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,169
      We're cape bros now, dude.

338
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,171
Oh, that's--                    
that's great.                   

339
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,373
           Marco,               
           you're making a face.

340
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,976
What face? This face?           
It's just my face.              

341
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,545
      Hey, hey, hey. No secrets.

342
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,046
            We're cape bros now.

343
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,382
Oh, well, it's no big deal,     

344
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,252
but I-I earned my cape.         

345
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,521
             Earned? Is that... 
             a word you made up?

346
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,523
I just went through a lot       
to get my cape.                 

347
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,193
I mean, I helped                
save Mewni, you know?           

348
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,862
            Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

349
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,198
        I keep forgetting,      
        you have to earn things.

350
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,866
                 [laughter]     

351
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,837
                   [sobbing]    

352
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,206
            [sniffling]         
            You're right, Marco.

353
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,842
     I guess I didn't earn this.

354
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,410
No, sensei.                     

355
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,280
            I mean, did I really
            earn my red belt?   

356
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,415
               [grunts]         
               Or my green belt?

357
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,450
           I guess I didn't earn
           any belts.           

358
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,052
            [chortles] You know,

359
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,754
                 I expected this
                 from my mother 

360
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,255
       and my probation officer,

361
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,258
        but I didn't expect this
        from you.               

362
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,928
[Marco] You know,               
first Ferguson                  

363
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:00,865
and Alfonso were weird,         
and then sensei was weird.      

364
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,434
[sighs]                         
I-I hate to say this,           

365
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,537
but it's like                   
my best friends                 

366
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,606
are jealous of all              
that I've accomplished.         

367
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,142
                 [sighs]        
                 Look, I get it.

368
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,377
          Earth and Mewni       
          are totally different.

369
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,479
    It must be hard to readjust.

370
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,648
No, Jackie,                     
you don't get it.               

371
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,551
This isn't about me,            
this is about them              

372
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,421
not being able to accept        
what this means.                

373
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,991
   How long has it been         
   since you took off your cape?

374
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,293
Pshh.                           
That's not relevant.            

375
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,928
       But it kind of feels like
       you went to Mewni        

376
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,798
            and you never really
            came back.          

377
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,466
           I'm not trying       
           to make you feel bad,

378
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,302
      but you haven't even asked
      about my summer.          

379
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,805
        You've just been talking
        about yours.            

380
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,475
Oh, no.                         
I'm the Croissant Girl.         

381
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,644
             -What?             
   -Oh, Jackie, I'm so sorry.   

382
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,946
                Wha-what are you
                talking about?  

383
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,449
    -Jackie, I'm going          
     to make this up to you.    
    -Make what up?              

384
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,652
You're never going to hear me   
say "croissant" again.          

385
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,861
[laughing]                      

386
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,297
             -What?             
     -You look so... fancy.     

387
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,699
                Okay, okay.     

388
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,668
              [clears throat]   

389
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,336
             Jackie Lynn Thomas,

390
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,139
           I'm here to take you 
           on the ultimate date.

391
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,775
Wait, seriously?                

392
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,878
       I'm done with Mewni, see?
       No cape.                 

393
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,780
           I'm back,            
           and I'm here for you.

394
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,315
    Me, huh?                    

395
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,985
Well, can you guess             
what I want to do right now?    

396
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,521
      Oh, Jackie, you know      
      I'm not good at this game.

397
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,157
Read my mind, Marco.            

398
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,158
                     Uh...      

399
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,160
                           Okay.

400
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,364
            You want to go to   
            Seashell...ville...?

401
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,066
         Shell Town? Shellville?

402
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,302
                  Necklace Land.
                  Necklace Land?
                  Necklace Land!

403
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,337
                  Shells?       

404
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,372
                   Seashell?    

405
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,507
                  Seashell Land?

406
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,676
Shelly.                         
Mike and Shelly.                

407
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,378
You want to go to               
Mike and Shelly's house.        

408
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,747
           No, dude, we're here.

409
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,382
            Ohh, the pier!      

410
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,552
        Okay, see, I-I never    
        would have gotten that  
        from a seashell.        

411
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,587
        So, what exactly are you
        supposed to do          

412
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,222
           on the ultimate date?

413
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,024
    Ohh!                        
    How about...                

414
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,827
           I win you            
      this cute dog thing.      

415
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,930
Ha! Yeah, these guys            
kind of look like you.          

416
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,033
One dozen balls, please.        

417
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,637
What?                           

418
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,442
[grunts]                        
This thing is rigged.           

419
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,077
              Let me try.       

420
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,847
         [bell ringing]         

421
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,882
            -Sweet!             
     -How did you do that?      

422
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,684
                   Grand prize  
                   for the lady.

423
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,019
      This is the best day      
          of my life.           

424
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,220
Marco.                          

425
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,855
         [bird squawks]         

426
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,025
Can you believe                 
this is almost our              
three month-a-versary?          

427
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,127
        Yeah, we're like        
     an old married couple.     

428
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,629
But we were doing long distance 
   for, like, half the time.    

429
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,232
  Don't think I wasn't jealous  
    of that cute lady mime.     

430
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,234
       Hey! Oh, n-- Aww.        

431
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,602
Here,                           
have some of mine.              

432
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,871
                     Aw, thanks.

433
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,739
          That's amazing of you,

434
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,242
      but I could actually go   
      for some real people food.

435
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,810
             How much cash      
             do you have on you?

436
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,646
I don't know--                  
$650?                           

437
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,117
        [both laughing]         
Whew, okay.                     

438
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,652
Is there                        
anything on the menu            
we haven't ordered yet?         

439
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,087
               There's that guy.

440
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,490
           [gurgling]           

441
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:16,827
No, I can't eat him--           
he looks so sad.                

442
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,562
        [comical accent]        
    Hey! What do you a-think    

443
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,832
       you are doing-ah?        

444
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,300
              Run!              

445
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,668
        [both laughing]         

446
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,304
      Hey! Give it back here-ah!

447
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,572
                            Ohh!

448
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,108
         [both panting]         

449
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,512
Wow, he didn't even             
say goodbye.                    

450
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,914
Not even a little               
claw wave or something.         

451
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,516
           Dude, it's a lobster.

452
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,717
    Oh.                         

453
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,191
 -What are you thinking about?  
           -Lobsters.           

454
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,426
We saved one, but we            
could have saved them all.      

455
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,828
            Do you want         
            to go back for them?

456
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,863
I kind of do, though.           

457
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,532
            Freedom to lobsters!

458
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,667
           Death                
           to fancy restaurants!

459
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,936
Oh ho ho! Yeah!                 
Whoo!                           

460
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,671
                 [laughing]     

461
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,307
             I finally feel like
             I'm back on Earth. 

462
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,142
Is that a good thing?           

463
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,977
             It's a great thing.

464
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,213
    [soft grunt]                

465
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,648
                There's no place
                I'd rather be.  

466
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,819
Take off your shirt.            

467
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,354
             -Huh?              
       -What? Just do it.       

468
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,156
               [nervous chuckle]
               But now? Why?    

469
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,424
                   It's just a--

470
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
    Huh.                        

471
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,961
                     What?      

472
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,029
                   How did that 
                   get in there?

473
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,434
    Let's talk.                 

474
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,174
                 Okay, I know   
                 this looks bad,
                 but I'm fine.  

475
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,909
               I can take it off
               anytime I want.  

476
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,745
    [sighs]                     

477
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,814
Look, today was awesome,        

478
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,183
and it's really sweet           
that you're trying,             

479
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,352
but if you're forcing           
yourself to stay in Echo Creek  

480
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,920
just so I'll be happy,          

481
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,922
then we'll both end up          
miserable.                      

482
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,091
You do see that, right?         

483
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:58,095
So, I figure                    
now's a good time               
to give you an out.             

484
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,864
       I want to make this work.

485
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,234
          You're my best friend,
          Jackie.               

486
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,502
    Mmm.                        

487
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,338
    Oh, Marco.                  

488
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,539
        [kiss]                  

489
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,742
    We both know                
    that's not true.            

490
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,980
      Stay amazing, okay?       

491
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:28,092
Well, I now release you         
from the bonds of academia.     

492
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,929
Be free. Uh... uh...            
something like that.            

493
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,932
We've never sent a kid          
to another dimension before.    

494
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,301
         Sure you have.         
  It's just like what started   

495
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,069
        when she did her        
       exchange program--       

496
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,772
        just, you know,         
   in the opposite direction.   

497
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,475
Well, I hope                    
I'm not sending you             
off to your death.              

498
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,377
        Marco, hold on!         
     You can't leave  yet!      

499
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,780
We want to say sorry for        
how we acted the other day.     

500
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,616
No, guys, I'm the one           
who needs to say sorry.         

501
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,386
I-I really haven't              
been around much, and...        

502
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,955
            Dude, it's okay.    

503
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,990
          Look, we-we           
          brought you something.

504
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,392
             It's our lucky die.

505
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,961
                It'll grant you 
                good fortune    
                on your travels.

506
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,929
             Aw.                
      Thanks, you guys.         

507
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,432
For the record,                 
I'm still mad at you.           

508
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,668
        I know.                 
        But I got you something.

509
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,339
[weeping] I'm gonna             
miss you so much!               

510
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,441
      [chuckles] I'm gonna      
       miss you too, man.       

511
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,944
              I also got        
              something for you.

512
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,347
Wha-- what?!?!                  
How long have you had this?     

513
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,450
   Don't ask questions          
   you don't want the answer to.

514
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,019
            [sighs]             
         What a creep.          

515
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,923
     Well, I guess this is      
         goodbye, guys.         

516
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,926
             I don't understand.
             We're just letting 
             Marco leave school?

517
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,361
             Is this even legal?

518
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,364
Shh. Marco needs to have        
his own French summer.          

519
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,733
        What? What is happening?

520
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,638
        -Bye-bye, Marc!         
          -Bye, Marco!          

521
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,973
             -Bye!              
           -Bye-bye!
