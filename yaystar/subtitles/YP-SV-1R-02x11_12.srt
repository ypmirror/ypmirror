   Then this will be a nap      
   they will never forget!

Katrina is delicate

95
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,350
                    They sleep, 
             then we feed them.

  Oh, come on.                  
  Where's the fun in that?      

101
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,730
 It's not just about            
 having fun, Star.              

102
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,066

 ( clears throat )              

132
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,107
      To stop croaking,         
      feed babies lunch.        

133
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,010
 Ah, that's easy.

139
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,994
You can't feed babies cake!     

140
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,863
              What? Fun, Marco. 
                      Remember?

   Oh, wait. Don't do that.     
    We gotta call Buffrog.      

145
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,044
Whoa there, Diaz.               

146
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,646
       I told Buffrog           

147
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:50,015
  I was the Crowned Princess    
       of Babysittonia.         

148
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,516
       We're doing this         
      by the book then.         

149

151
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,854
   It says they need a bath.    

152
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,523
   Okay. You corral the babies. 
                I got the bath. 

153
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,226

159

       ( phone ringing )

        What do I do?           

163
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,950

  I don't want to answer it.

to the music.

       Last time he got         
       his hands dirty          

335
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,986
      he was changing diapers.  
      Heh-heh.                  

336
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,588
                    You want me 
       to change <i> your </i> diaper? 

337
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,356
( gasps )                       
( growls angrily )              

338
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,791
    Guys! Guys, guys, guys.     

339
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,092
         We're all on           
     the same team here.        

340
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,360
      We have work to do.       

341
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,164
    ( country music plays )     

342
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,336
                  ( tap tap )   

343
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,210
            Cooorrn!            

344
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,644
          Coorrrrrrnn!          

345
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,547
Wait. Only Mewmans              
have corn.                      

346
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,217
How rats have corn              
when monsters are starving?     

347
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,618
         That's what we're here 
                   to find out. 

348
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,955
In that case,                   
let's get show on road.         

349
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,356
            BOTH:               
       Thumpie-bumpies!         

350
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,858
           Okay, here is plan.  

351
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,392
            A) We capture rat.  

352
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,361
     B) Make him tell us        
      where he got corn.        

353
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,863
         Well, great.           
    I'll just go grab him!      

354
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,632
                        No, no. 
         Give your abs a break. 

355
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,567
        We must do this quietly.

356
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,404
         Let me teach you about 
       the element of surprise. 

357
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,173
     ( grunts and shouts )      

358
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:39,577
           BOOFLY:              
  Aw, yeah! Buffrog's back!     

359
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,213
       ( rat squeaks )          
          ( softly )            
          Surprise!             

360
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,382
   ( cackles triumphantly )     

361
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,017
       Okay, little guy.        

362
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,419
          You and me            
    will have little talk.      

363
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,358
    ( shouts in surprise )      
            Wait!               

364
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,525
           DOGBULL:             
        What was that?          

365
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,861
  Baby oil on your fingers?     
          ( laughs )            

366
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,196
BOOFLY:                         
Umm, Buffrog?                   

367
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,731
Did that just happen?           

368
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,032
               Uhhh...          

369
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,500
Look what was in                
the Lost and Found.             

370
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,602
                         He-he. 
       Yeah, 'cause he lost it. 

371
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,204
         And we found it! Right?

372
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,606
           ( laughs )           

373
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,708
                       Uuuhh... 
                 Hey Buff Frog! 

374
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,846
             Why don't you show 
         the team your patented 
       interrogation technique. 

375
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,181
     This guy's the best!       
    ( chuckles nervously )      

376
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,524
 We will do this the easy way   
     <i> and </i> the hard way.        

377
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,626
      Easy for me,              

378
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,095
 and hard for you.              

379
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,298
        This is amazing!        

380
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,966
                        He-heh. 
          Told you he was good. 

381
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,369
Where did you get the corn?     

382
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,877
            Uuhhh!              
          ( groans )            

383
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,446
     This rat is tougher        
       than I thought.          

384
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,581
        You're not going        
        to want to see this.    

385
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,583
       Uuh, yeah I do!          
         No, no, no.            

386
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,585
Lets, uh, leave the master      
to his work.                    

387
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,955
 You know how artists are.      
 ( chuckles )                   

388
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,625
         ( whimpers )           
           ( thud )             

389
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,894
 Ooh! What is happening to me?  

390
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,097
         ( squeaks )            
   I can't do this to you.      

391
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,732
 Wait. What am I doing?         

392
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,636
 I know what you're thinking.   

393
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,740
  You think I'm soft because    
 I have children, don't you?    

394
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,775
          ( growls )            
        I'll show you!          

395
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,777
          ( Rat squeals loudly )

396
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,580
       ( Rat screeching )       

397
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,615
Oh, and can you believe         
Nadia here?                     

398
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,485
Seriously. There ought          
to be a law against             
something that cute.            

399
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,521
Oooh! We should do              
live chat with them.            

400
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,689
 I call Star right now.         

401
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,291
         ( beeping )            
      ( Rat screeching )        

402
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,492
     It's ringing!              

403
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,593
BOOFLY:                         
I'm telling you,                

404
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,829
              He probably found 
           all the corn by now. 

405
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,132
        What did you just do?!  

406
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,602
       You let him go?!         
          Umm, yes.             

407
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,305
        But it's uhh--          
      It's all according        
         to the plan.           

408
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,974
I've seen him do this           
a hundred times.                
It's a classic.                 

409
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,510
Buffrog interrogates            
the prisoner,                   
then lets him go,               

410
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,946
'cause he's so freaked out that 
he'll lead us right to where    
the corn came from...           

411
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,347
  technique.                    

412
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,983
        Am I right, B?          
           Oh, yes.             

413
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,551
             Yes, never fails.  

414
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,389
           ( sniffs )           

415
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,958
Well, I guess I can track       
his scent from here.            

416
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,926
 ( continues sniffing )         

417
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,064
       Hey, Bruh, are you good? 
                  'Cause, um... 

418
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,366
    that didn't look good.      
       I know. I know!          

419
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,569
This should be easy...          
but nothing is feeling right.   

420
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,039
           You blow this again, 
          I'm not gonna be able 
              to cover for you! 

421
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,774
           No, no.              
         I got this.            

422
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,846
         ( footsteps            
    in marching cadence )       

423
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,281
          Jackpot.              

424
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,487
        Yes, but this           
      is not the source.        

425
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,022
     Is only supply route.      

426
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,224
Hey, Buff-Daddy.                
You with us, or what?           

427
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,560
   Yes. One hundred percent.    

428
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,162
         Okay, guys...          

429
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,763
          ( softly )            
           quiet...             

430
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,667
  ( soft metallic whooshing )   

431
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,004
   ( loud baby music plays )    

432
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,405
  ( Buffrog gaps and fumbles )  

433
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,773
        ( rats squeak )         

434
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,942
         Uuh... Umm...          

435
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,043
            Shh!                

436
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,244
       ( grunting )             

437
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,779
         ( hoarsely )           
           Stop it!             

438
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,549
( music slows down )            
( Buffrog grunts )              

439
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,919
   ( Rats squeak and squeal )   

440
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,688
         ( baby music           
    fades into distance )       

441
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,723
         That was...            
     Katrina's favorite--       

442
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,859
    ( growls menacingly )       
      Guys, guys, guys!
