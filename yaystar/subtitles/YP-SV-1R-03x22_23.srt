I'm at your service,            
milady.                         

126
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,079
        Ha ha ha.               
        Don't ever call me that.

127
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,415
      Now get some sleep.       

128
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,550
    Tomorrow, we're gonna be    
  waist deep in sewer sludge.   

129
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,454
                     Can't wait.

130
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,297
          Let's ride.           

131
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,601
           [snoring]            

132
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,772
         Okay, this is          
       just for tonight.        

133
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,909
       [blows raspberry]        

134
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,378
  Don't look at me like that.   

135
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,947
Hey, sorry.                     
I'm late again.                 

136
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,516
Where are we                    
riding today?                   

137
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,184
        This next job's         
          pretty big,           

138
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,586
  so I hired Talon Raventalon   
     for some extra muscle.     

139
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,622
    Who's Talon Raventalon?     

140
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,090
           I'm Talon Raventalon!

141
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:39,197
        [electric guitar        
          riff plays]           

142
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,768
      One glass of worms.       
         Extra wiggly.          

143
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,770
Hekapoo, we don't               
need this bro.                  

144
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,372
          Actually, we kinda do.

145
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,108
            You've been so busy,
            I wasn't sure you   
            were gonna show,    

146
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,709
                 and I can't do 
                 this job alone.

147
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,945
I guess that's fair...          

148
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,980
but him?                        

149
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,149
        ( loud chewing )        

150
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,751
So what's the job,              
anyway?                         

151
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,486
         Dragon cyclers         
      don't ask questions.      

152
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,321
      Dragon cyclers ride!      

153
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,961
       - Follow us, okay?       
           - [yells]            

154
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,966
So what are we                  
doing today?                    

155
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,802
       - Something fun.         
       - Ooh, like what?        

156
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,672
        Like closing up         
    these portals for good.     

157
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,843
Wait, so... what?               

158
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,812
   There's a pattern to where   
these portals have been opening.

159
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,982
    And the next one should     
     open right over there.     

160
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,018
   Whatever comes out of it,    
     we're takin' it down!      

161
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,021
           Oh, yeah!            
           With this!           

162
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,157
Doesn't this seem               
like overkill?                  

163
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,992
          Talon likes           
           overkill.            

164
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,760
        [electric guitar        
          riff plays]           

165
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,763
             H-Poo, can we chat?

166
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,266
So it's just that               
closing these portals           
with you                        

167
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,602
has been the highlight          
of my time on Mewni.            

168
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,337
Do we really                    
have to stop?                   

169
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,372
       Marco, this has been fun,

170
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,040
       but I've got a job to do.

171
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,775
Yeah, just                      
don't do it.                    

172
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,179
   My job is to stop whatever   
   comes out of that portal.    

173
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,514
       [Talon] Incoming!        

174
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,017
        There it is!            

175
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,952
           Oh, yeah!            

176
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,521
             Stop!              

177
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,891
   Marco, what are you doing?   

178
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,693
I'm not sure,                   
but you need to stop.           

179
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,130
 Oh, I'm just gettin' started.  

180
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,999
            Ba-kaw!             

181
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,070
      Marco, it's my job.       

182
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,176
             Star?              

183
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,512
      Oh, I love harpoons.      

184
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,214
         No! You idiot!         

185
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,917
                       Ha ha!   

186
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,562
             Star!              

187
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,468
        [relieved sigh]         

188
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,839
      That was some great       
        riding, Hekapoo.        

189
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,508
You knew?                       

190
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,210
You knew that Star              
was the one opening             
these portals,                  

191
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,912
and you didn't                  
tell me?!                       

192
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,715
                    Okay, okay, 
                    hear me out.

193
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,518
I'm reporting this              
to the high commission.         

194
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,387
              Okay, yeah, I lied
              to you about Star,

195
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,189
                   but not about
                  anything else.

196
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,291
        Working with you        
      has been incredible,      

197
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,727
      and I don't want it       
            to end.             

198
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,296
        Please don't report this
        to the high commission. 

199
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,800
    Star needs to figure out    
   her new powers on her own.   

200
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,536
      Do you have any idea      
     how dangerous that is?     

201
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,405
        I'm her squire;         
  I can make sure she's safe.   

202
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,041
        Haven't I earned        
       your trust by now?       

203
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,042
              No!!              

204
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,911
            [sighs]             

205
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,312
         [adult voice]          
     Pretty please, H-Poo.      

206
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:45,249
      Oh, you know I can't      
    resist your adult voice.    

207
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,619
Fine. I won't report            
this, for your sake,            

208
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,322
but us working                  
together is over.               

209
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,291
           - Hekapoo.           
           - Here.              

210
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,326
You're gonna                    
need this.                      

211
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,495
      Star's lucky to have      
       a squire like you.       

212
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,498
              Yah!              

213
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,305
             You wanna hang out?

214
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,211
        [electric guitar        
          riff plays]           

215
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,216
          Uh... hello?          

216
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,153
   - [screams] Creepy blast!    
        - [Marco yells]         

217
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,522
        [Marco groaning]        

218
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,524
Marco?                          

219
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,760
      What are you doing?       

220
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,295
     And what are you doing     
      with your scissors?       

221
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,531
                  Okay, okay,   
                  I can explain.

222
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,867
      First you're lying,       
    and now you're stealing.    

223
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,303
     - What are you doing?      
     - I've been closing        
     your portals.              

224
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:43,307
  Uh, you've been opening them  
    in different dimensions,    

225
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,344
  and I've been closing them,   
         with Hekapoo.          

226
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,346
         Wha-wha-what?          

227
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,481
   Does Hekapoo know about...   

228
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,551
     Yeah. Yeah, she knows.     
   She's not happy about it.    

229
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,688
                 Oh, no. Oh, no,
                 oh, no!        

230
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,223
Star, I like                    
adventures,                     

231
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,325
but I like keeping              
you safe more,                  

232
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,295
so I can stop                   
doing this.                     

233
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,631
Can you stop                    
doing that?                     

234
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,232
               Whoa, what is it?

235
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,902
I think it's                    
what you've been                
looking for.                    

236
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,207
     Okay, I thought it was     
            a dream,            

237
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,042
     but then, it was like,     
        "Oh, no, you ate        

238
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,378
    all these goblin dogs,"     
    but it was not a dream.     

239
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,647
     And then I brought         
     the goblin dogs truck      
     into my bedroom,           

240
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,982
and then, I crushed             
my bed with it,                 

241
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,751
and I had to turn my bed        
back into a bed,                

242
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,053
and then I told                 
my mom about it,                

243
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,756
and then my mom                 
was, like, "That                
shouldn't be happening."        

244
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,725
And I was like...               
Jenna.                          

245
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,326
        Stop blowing in         
         Marco's hair.          

246
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,028
That was you?                   

247
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,164
   Sorry. Got a little bored.   
          No offense.           

248
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,601
Yeah, Star, can you just        
get to the point, please?       

249
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,870
[sighs]                         

250
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,438
Okay, I'm sleep-portaling.      

251
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:51,409
In my sleep, every night,       
I hear this sound.              

252
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,179
It's like...                    
[high-pitched screeching]       

253
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,381
No, no, that's not it.          

254
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:01,052
     [high-pitched whining]     

255
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,424
          Okay, Star, we get it.
          Can we just get to    
          the point, please?    

256
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,426
I've been following             
this sound                      

257
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,928
to the same location            
every night,                    

258
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,463
but I never make it there,      

259
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,266
because I wake up,              
and that's where you            
come in, Janna.                 

260
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,802
   You've gotta hypnotize me    
     so I can stay asleep.      

261
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,804
What? Hypnotize you?            

262
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,073
Star, shouldn't you leave       
that to a trained professional? 

263
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,407
            You doubt my skills?

264
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,942
Yeah, actually,                 
I do.                           

265
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,444
                  Chickenbutt.  

266
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,479
What the heck?                  
What happened?                  

267
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,615
     You guys, stop messing     
   around and get over here.    

268
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,483
Hey, check it out.              

269
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,485
   I linked my compact phone    
         to my mirror,          

270
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,420
    so you'll be able to see    
        whatever I see.         

271
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,790
Marco, you've got               
the scissors.                   

272
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,292
If anything goes wrong          
out there, you come get me.     

273
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,660
You're my lifeline.             

274
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,395
     What if you get lost,      

275
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,731
        or go so far out        
    that we can't find you?     

276
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,901
    Marco, we've dealt with     
  much worse stuff than this.   

277
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,337
         Yeah, I guess.         

278
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,476
        Okay, Star, take        
      a nice, deep breath.      

279
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,981
    Now, focus on my watch.     

280
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,983
                     Hey, that's
                     my watch.  

281
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,586
  - Dude, this is about Star.   
  Get over yourself.            
  - [grunts]                    

282
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,988
                  Keep your eyes
                  on the watch. 

283
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,024
            You're feeling light
            as a feather.       

284
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,164
                And now we wait.

285
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,134
So what exactly                 
does it look like               
when she portals?               

286
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,037
                   Like that.   

287
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,045
               We have lift-off.

288
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,502
       I'm here for you.        

289
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,538
         Your lifeline.         

290
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,574
Uh, what's all that?            

291
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,377
    Spiritual chromatograph,    

292
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,313
       magic wave scope,        
      energy oscillotron,       

293
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,582
      and a jigsaw puzzle       
   for when things get slow.    

294
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,519
But most importantly,           
the map.                        

295
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,355
              Uh... uh...       
              where is she?!    

296
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,489
                   Here she is, 
                   she's here.  

297
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,424
                  No, no, maybe 
                   she's here.  

298
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,494
                   Or here. No. 
                   Forget this. 
                   I'm goin' in.

299
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,197
Dude, relax. She's got          
a long way to go.               

300
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,602
                   Yeah, I guess
                   you're right.

301
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,874
                        So...   

302
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,576
                        Janna.  

303
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,212
         Been a while since     
         we hung out one-on-one.

304
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,614
      - We never really--       
         - Chickenbutt.         

305
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,650
[snoring]                       

306
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,393
  [high-pitched whining noise]  

307
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,702
          What the...           

308
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,370
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.           

309
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,472
                    Huh... what?

310
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,807
                  Janna?        
                  What did you--

311
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,476
Shut up and look.               

312
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,613
             Wait. Where is that
             on the map?        

313
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,649
I don't know.                   
She's off the map.              

314
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:23,087
         [Marco] Star.          
      No, no, no, no, no.       

315
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,522
              Don't go in there.

316
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,639
         No! That's it.         
         I'm goin' in.          

317
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,645
                  What happened?
                   Where is she?

318
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,513
       I can't get to her       
       with the scissors        

319
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,482
        if I don't know         
         where she is.          

320
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,442
          You're here.          

321
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,145
           I'm here.            

322
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,550
       Stop it, stop it,        
            stop it.            

323
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,185
                [soft whinnying]

324
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,521
                    You're here!

325
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,490
          Okay, okay,           
           I'm here.            

326
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,393
       But where is here?       

327
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,194
        You don't know?         

328
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,764
      You're in the realm       
           of magic.            

329
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,639
              Wow!              

330
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,609
        It's like Toffee        
      was never even here.      

331
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,212
     It's been reborn-ded.      

332
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,848
       That's not a word.       

333
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,984
          That sound.           

334
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,553
   The song of the firstborn.   

335
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,822
   She's been calling to you.   

336
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,859
      [high-pitched whine       
           continues]

[high-pitched whining]          

338
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,867
             Okay, stop, please.

339
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,036
                  And thank you.

340
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,705
                 So who are you?

341
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,642
Do you not recognize            
your own creation?              

342
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,013
          [loud gasp]           

343
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,549
                 I made you?!   

344
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,619
                   I did good.  

345
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,188
            So you're the one   
            that called me here?

346
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,357
I can only call one             
who wishes to be called.        

347
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,393
      I don't understand.       

348
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,928
        Why would I wish        
         to be called?          

349
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,363
I don't know.                   

350
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,366
Perhaps the answer              
rests here,                     

351
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,702
     in the realm of magic.     

352
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,771
               Oh, I can't stay.

353
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,240
      - I have to go home.      
           - Do you?            

354
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,276
                     [whinnying]

355
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,483
     I guess I could stay.

             Magic.

00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,648
     Oh, that's a bad idea.     

368
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,484
   And that's coming from me.   

369
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,524
    - Oh, you're gonna die!

370
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,227
              Huh.              

371
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,796
       Nothing happened.

   Whoa. The All-Seeing Eye.    

377
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,155
    Spying leads to crying?     

378
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,191
            Just hold it up     
           so I can read it.

Okay.

        - [Marco] Star!
