30
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:24,383
   I'm just really excited

00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,118
              How do you do it?

00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,891
Nope. Just normal               
guidance counselor stuff.       

34
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,427
 Have you given much thought    
       to your future?

00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,229
                  Totally.

00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,132
                When I grow up, 
      I wanna raise warnicorns.

         a fun hobby.           

39
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,305
      But you might not         
  have much time for hobbies    

40
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,739
     as the queen of Mewni.     

41
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,675
             Queen?             

42
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,745
        I may not know          
        your fortune,           

43
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,316
       but your future          
       is set in stone.         

44
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,451
             Stone?             

45
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,420
 Are you dating anyone?         

46
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,255
                   What? Uh, no.

47
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,790
 What about that Marco boy?     

48
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,758
 Got a secret crush on him?     

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,427
              He's my roommate. 
            We're just friends. 

50
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,496
      Yeah, that's weird        
    to date your roommate.      

51
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,798
   Maybe someone else then.     
It's never too early to start   

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,833
   searching for the future     
        king of Mewni.          

53
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,101
             Maybe.             

54
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,237
Cheer up, Star.                 

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,672
Or should I say                 
Your Majesty.                   

56
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,674
              Hmm.              

57
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,912
So how'd it go?                 

58
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:30,249
   Or we can catch up later.    

59
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,417
           Mr. Diaz.            

60
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,520
I've been very anxious          
to speak to you.                

61
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,755
     Seen my test scores,       
          have you?             

62
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,423
            Indeed.             

63
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,459
        Garbage Island?!        

64
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,594
What's the use of taking        
honors classes                  

65
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,863
if it gets you sent             
to the middle of nowhere?       

66
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,833
                   So don't go. 
    At least you have a choice. 

67
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,102
           Apparently, the only 
             thing in my future 

68
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,304
                 is being queen.

69
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,873
Oh, man, I'd love               
to be queen.                    

70
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,643
You never have to               
think about what to wear.       

71
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,311
You have somebody               
do that for you.                

72
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:00,779
                ( groans )      

73
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,814
People would just love you      
because they have to,           

74
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,683
no matter how weird             
you are.                        

75
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,717
                 ( groans )     

76
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,553
You never have                  
to bathe alone.                 

77
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,421
      Marco, please stop        
           talking.             

78
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,894
                  Head janitor, 
                Garbage Island.

80
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,233
       ( plopping sound )       

81
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,035
     I'll come back later.      

82
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,146
                All right, sir, 
         phase one is complete. 

83
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,480
                    What's next?

84
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,982
             Sir, are you there?

85
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,718
           You idiot!           

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,987
          You forgot            
 the most important part. Me!   

87
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,989
             I got confirmation.

88
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,758
         - Starco is            
     completely platonic.       
       - MARCO: Starco?         

89
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,328
      Make sure there's         
    no possibility of them      

90
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,896
      ever being a thing.       

91
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,764
 Absolutely, sir.               

92
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,067
     Also, stop offering        
       everyone candy.          

93
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,169
      You're gonna blow         
          my cover.             

94
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,870
        I want her back.        

95
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,906
        - I gotta go.           
       - I'm not done.          

96
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,508
       No. You don't understand.

97
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,845
        - I gotta go.           
      - Flush me first!         

98
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,414
         ( whistling )          

99
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,583
                Hey, Mr. Candle.

100
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,952
 Oh, hello, Marco.              

101
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,887
         I appreciate           
      all your guidance         

102
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,556
     with Garbage Island        
           and all,             

103
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,625
      but I'm gonna pass.       

104
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,730
Actually, I was just thinking   
        I might be...           

105
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,431
         king of Mewni.         

106
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,966
        ( sputtering )          
            What?!              

107
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,635
        The thing is,           
          Star and I            

108
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,937
     have recently become       
       smooch buddies.          

109
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,539
          On the lips.          

110
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,875
  Even if that's true, kid,     
you shouldn't say that out loud.

111
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,777
        Yeah, we've been trying 
                    all styles. 

112
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,413
              German, Italian...

113
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,048
                 Polynesian.    

114
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,884
       My tonsils are so tired, 
         I can't feel my teeth. 

115
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,955
      ( ferocious growl )       

116
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,892
Busted. I knew you weren't      
a guidance counselor.           

117
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,999
       Oh. These women          
      look so miserable.

00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,102
       ( sighs heavily )

00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,472
     MIRROR: <i> Calling Mom.</i>

00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,007
   <i> What did you do?</i>            

121
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,976
        What... nothing!        

122
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,811
              Yet.              

123
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,813
         I'd like to            
      ask you something.        

124
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,948
         Are you happy?         

125
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,118
   <i> Happy? What difference</i>      
       <i> does that make?</i>         

126
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,688
     I mean, I don't know.      

127
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,690
         Do you have            
       any warnicorns?          

128
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,794

       <i> any warnicorns?</i>

00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,632
      <i> - Oh. Apparently,</i>        
         <i> I have 19.</i>            
         - Oh, sweet.           

131
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,301
 <i> But when you are queen, you</i>   
<i>don't have time for warnicorns.</i> 

132
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,004
    <i> Everything I'm saying</i>      
   <i> is in your guide book.</i>      

133
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,006
 <i> Incidentally, you may want</i>    
    <i> to review the chapter</i>      

134
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,974
         <i> on hair care.</i>         

135
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:46,011
<i>If you're going to be queen,</i>    
 <i> you have to look the part.</i>    

136
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,013
     <i> Don't worry so much</i>

       <i> Love you. Bye.</i>

          ( buzzing )           

139
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,002
         Stop! I knew           
     you were listening.        

140
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,571
  I never made out with Star.   

141
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,974
I just said that                
to get your goat.               

142
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,576
             What?              

143
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,144
                 You lied to me.

144
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,546
Well, you lied to Star.         

145
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,883
You made her think              
all she's good for              
is being queen.                 

146
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,222
        Dude, just take me home.

147
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,892
        I can't do that.        

148
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,761
       You know too much.       

149
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,729
    Now I gotta destroy you.    

150
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,898
            What?!              
       That's not fair.         

151
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,333
 All right, fine.               

152
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,235
Battle to the death.            
I win, you die.                 

153
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,103
        What do I get           
          if I win?             

154
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,572
 It's not gonna happen.         

155
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,075
So, yeah, ask for               
whatever you want.              

156
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,911
     If I win, you gotta        
        take me home.           

157
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,347
   And you gotta tell Star      
          the truth.            

158
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:58,283
Fine.                           
Pick your weapon.               

159
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,685
 Dueling battle axes?           

160
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,454
 Rhino fiend joust?             

161
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,890
Pear grenades                   
of anguish?                     

162
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:05,924
         ( shrieking )          

163
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,595
           What about ping-pong?

164
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,030
          That's cool.          

165
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,933
         Your weapon of choice, 
                      my liege. 

166
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,768
       I oughta warn you,       

167
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,303
 I'm not only a karate master.  

168
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,872
       I'm also good at         
         ball sports.           

169
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,543
              Ow!               

170
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:28,046
       Point, Master Tom.       

171
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,550
         Okay, so I'm           
       a little rusty.          

172
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,552
       Wait till you...         
           hi-yah!              

173
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:37,155
             Owww!              

174
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,042
          Game point.           

175
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,780
                   In your face!

176
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,915
            Ow! Ugh!            

177
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,917
Since when do ping-pong balls   
        hurt so much?           

178
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,086
       These balls are          
      guided by demons.         

179
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,957
       Okay. Let's play         
     for real this time.        

180
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,325
       Double or nothing.       

181
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,694
                   Dude, you're 
                out of paddles. 

182
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,362
                   Just give up.

183
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,499
        No, it's fine.          
   Here, you can have mine.     

184
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,767
        I don't need it.        

185
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:28,106
       Hey! Isn't this          
      kind of cheating?         

186
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,674
        You think this          
         is cheating?           

187
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,643
    You should try playing      
      Star at ping-pong.        

188
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,311
      Well, Star doesn't        
        really cheat.           

189
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,113
      She just makes up         
        her own rules.          

190
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,817
And then she changes the rules  
again halfway through the game. 

191
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,620
      Oh, so that's why         
         I never win.           

192
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,222
        She just does           
     whatever she wants.        

193
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,690
       Yeah, that's Star.       

194
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,159
             Yeah.              

195
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,195
     She is kinda awesome.      

196
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,630
       You know you're          
   never gonna win, right?      

197
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:55,200
         I know, but            
      you're not either.        

198
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,669
     It doesn't matter if       
   you beat me at ping-pong     

199
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,838
   or pull out all my organs.   

200
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,206
     You can't make Star        
      be your girlfriend        

201
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,375
      unless she wants to.      

202
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,618
    Star, I have something      
          to tell...            

203
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,388
             Whoa.              

204
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,056
        Oh, hey, Marco.         

205
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,091
   Did you know that if you     
  cut off a mermaid's tail,     

206
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,594
   you can never be queen?      
 It's all in the guide book.    

207
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,063
       Star, you don't          
       have to do that.         

208
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,698
      Oh, thank goodness.       

209
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
     I'm so sorry, Tiffany.     

210
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,268
  I never wanted to hurt you.   

211
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,504
                Shameful.       

212
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,506
     Tom! What's going on?      

213
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,508
I have something                
I need to confess.              

214
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,744
I used Mr. Candle               
to try to get                   
back together with you.         

215
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,681
It took me destroying           
Marco 58 games to zero          

216
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,883
to realize I was wrong.         

217
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,352
 Like, I slaughtered him.       

218
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,188
I mean, beating him             
was so easy.                    

219
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,357
       Okay, she gets it.       

220
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,926
All I wanted                    
was to get you back.            

221
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,295
     But I never stopped        
 to consider what you wanted.   

222
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,297
           I'm sorry.           

223
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,102
    Ow!                         

224
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,137
        You tricked me.         

225
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,105
But it doesn't even             
make a difference.              

226
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,941
I'm still gonna                 
be queen.                       

227
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,577
    Yeah, but that doesn't      
   sound like a bad thing,      

228
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,713
     because you're gonna       
     run Mewni your way.        

229
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:17,382
      No matter how destructive.

230
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,218
          That's true.          

231
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,461
         Point, Marco.          

232
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,665
       Well, I should go.       

233
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,834
         By the way,            
      I like your hair.         

234
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,809
STAR: So you guys               
were hangin' out?               

235
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,746
           Uh, yeah.            

236
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,115
Is he still                     
dark and broody?                

237
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,583
                       Oh, yeah.

238
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,818
            But he's not so bad.

239
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,489
No, Brittany,                   
I don't believe                 

240
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,691
your life has peaked            
at such a young age.            

241
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,093
    Dude, abort the mission.    

242
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,328
           I'm done.            

243
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,330
          ( whistles )          

244
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,844
( growling noises )             

245
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,284
             Star?              

246
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,458
         I don't know           
       my combination!          

247
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,572
          ( gasps )             
        I'm... I'm...           

248
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,341
      I'm wearing a suit!       

249
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,411
     What are your plans        
  for the future, Mr. Diaz?     

250
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,512
          Mr. Candle?           

251
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,515
    GIRL: We're moving on       
       with our lives.          

252
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,418
    But I haven't made up       
       my balloon yet.          

253
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,656
          My red belt.          

254
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,725
      I've been looking         
      all over for you.         

255
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,827
             Wait!              

256
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,261
           Come back.           

257
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,230
      Marco. Marco, Marco!      

258
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,399
    - Marco, Marco, Marco.      
       - ( screaming )          

259
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,700
           - Star?              
         - You okay?            

260
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,502
  Sounded like you were having  

261
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,204
 one of those "stuck in life"   
        dreams again.           

262
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,207
     Yeah. Wait. What are       
      you doing in here?        

263
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,243
     I'm hanging my first       
    Love Sentence poster.       

264
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,512
          You can be            
     my prisoner of love,       

265
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,848
         Justin Towers.         

266
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,250
       Uh... that's not         
        what I meant.           

267
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,852
                 I was sleeping.

268
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:37,522
          Oh! Right.            
      You have a hammer?        

269
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,924
 I'm putting this bad boy up    
      Earth girl style.         

270
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,227
           No majack!           

271
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,596
    Yeah, all I'm saying is,    

272
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,265
      you could've tried        
     knocking on my door,       
      Earth girl style.         

273
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,701
     Why would I do that        
  when I have dimensional...    

274
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,402
              Oh!               

275
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:55,406
     How can I be so "duh"?     

276
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,642
   Nothing's easy on Earth!     
          ( laughs )            

277
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,412
   I'm gonna find a hammer      
        the hard way.           

278
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,382
        Scavenger hunt!         

279
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,018
   Do we even have a hammer?    

280
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,725
      Sensei, I need to         
      talk to you about         

281
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,994
   - graduating to a red--      
          - Silence!            

282
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,630
           I'm about to achieve 
     oneness with the universe. 

283
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,935
              ( inhales loudly )

284
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:27,639
  ( unintelligible muttering    
        and grunting )          

285
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,142
    Now, bow to your sensei.    

286
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,513
      Master, I've been         
 a green belt for five years.   

287
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,182
       It's time for me         
         to level up.           

288
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,484
          ( laughter )          

289
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,952
     Five years, and you        
     think you're ready?        

290
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,520
   Go get an ice cream cone     
        or something,           

291
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,289
               and quit wasting 
                   my Saturday. 

292
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,523
 Sensei, I'm serious.           

293
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,325
             Are you sure?      

294
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,527
   The training you desire      
  has broken many a student.    

295
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,463
I'm ready to do                 
whatever it takes.              

296
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,465
                 Fine.          

297
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,101
       We start... <i> now!</i>        

298
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,404
     - Clip the toenail.        
         - Seriously?           
     - Clip the toenail!!       

299
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,008
     - Plunge the toilet.       
            - Ugh.              

300
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,410
             Take the deduction.

301
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,549
  Is your moment of failure     
      at hand, Mr. Diaz?        

302
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,251
          No, sensei.           

303
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,357
    Hey, guys!                  

304
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,492
        Just ignore me.         

305
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,028
Why exactly are we              
ignoring you?                   

306
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,998
   I'm scavenging the house     
        for a hammer.           

307
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,334
         Just pretend           
        I'm not here.           

308
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,903
               Okey-dokey.      

309
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,205
         - Do we even           
        have a hammer?          
            - No.               

310
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,040
          ( groaning )          

311
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,743
      If I was a hammer...      

312
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,579
      - I'd be up there!        
      - ( dogs barking )        

313
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,148
 We have to do something.       

314
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,817
    That's right, Mr. Diaz.     

315
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,353
      Feel the squeegee         
      deep in your soul.        

316
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,388
             Preparation is key.

317
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,390
    - You never know when       
     trouble will arrive.       
       - ( horn honks )         

318
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,559
        - Hello, dear.          
            - Mom!              

319
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,829
   How nice to have you...      
  visit me at my own house.     

320
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,531
   It's nice to see you finally 
      getting to those windows. 

321
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,500
         And you have           
 a little friend helping you.   

322
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,702
Maybe I'll fix you              
a big helper's snack.           

323
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,271
 Your mom seems nice.           

324
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,072
             Oh, yes, she often 
               comes to see me. 

325
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,440
              But not too often,

326
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,609
              on account of her 
           having her own home. 

327
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,578
      I'm glad you made         
      that distinction,         

328
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,513
   because it almost seemed     
   like this was her house.     

329
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,448
 Here you go, boys.             

330
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,584
If you need me,                 
I'll be taking a nap            
in my room.                     

331
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,885
Okay?                           

332
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,787
             Okay.              

333
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,622
       It's clear that          
      you live at home,         

334
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:28,526
      in a room that is         
unsettlingly similar to mine.   

335
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,894
          Uh... great.          

336
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,896
       Then you'll have         
   no problem cleaning it.      

337
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,631
         Wait a minute.         

338
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,600
     Are you training me        
       for a red belt,          

339
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,201
   or are you making me do      
       all your chores?         

340
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,903
         No, no, we're training.

341
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,772
            Ha! Cut the toenail.

342
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,875
Ugh! I think I've               
more than earned my red belt.   

343
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,611
    Uh, you can't because...    

344
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,880
            I, uh...            

345
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,482
          ( sobbing )           

346
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,118
      - Because I'm also        
      only a green belt.        
           - What?!             

347
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,421
      I didn't know what        
 I wanted to do with my life    

348
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,923
      so I rented a dojo        
      and ordered these         
  instructional videotapes.     

349
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,726
Each tape told me what to learn 
   to get each color belt.      

350
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,429
                   It was going 
          pretty well at first, 

351
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,497
 - but I only watched as far    
   as the green belt tape.      
   - Why'd you stop there?      

352
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,634
  Because the red belt tape     
  got stuck in the machine.     

353
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,570
     Now it just holds up       
       the short leg on         
      my computer table.        

354
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,673
Couldn't you just try           
to get the tape out             
and untangle it?                

355
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,510
     I did, but that tape       
got stuck in another machine!   

356
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,347
     What kind of sensei        
    can't even work a VCR?      

357
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,751
      ( breathes deeply )       

358
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:30,188
     Well, we can totally       
       find it online.          

359
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,624
        Except we can't.        

360
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:37,428
    It seems like this is       
  one of the rarest sets of     
   videotapes in existence.     

361
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,697
      I guess we'll just        
     have to find it IRL.       

362
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,299
No way.                         

363
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,701
I owe those guys                
too much in back taxes.         

364
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,670
          IRL means             
        in real life.           

365
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,172
           We just have to find 
    a copy somewhere out there. 

366
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,341
 I see. In that case,           

367
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,909
 we'll need wheels.             

368
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,779
              ( Marco laughing )

369
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,281
       - To adventure!          
       - Feel the wind          
        in my tassels!          

370
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,649
        ( dog barking )         

371
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,619
Mom, call Rocket.               
He's being weird.               

372
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,122
   ( loud clattering noises )   

373
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,860
          ( groaning )          

374
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:13,731
        Find... hammer.         

375
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,003
What is this place?             

376
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,538
          It's cool.            
       You'll love it.          

377
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,242
Yuck. Come on.                  
It's like a yard sale,          
but inside.                     

378
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,977
     These are the only         
        kind of places          

379
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,745
         you can find           
   old videotapes anymore.      

380
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,480
        - Is that it?           
            - No.               

381
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,215
        - Is that it?           
            - No.               

382
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,051
        - Is that it?           
           - Nope.              

383
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,986
          - Is that?            
           - Nope.              

384
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,487
           Got it. Never mind.  

385
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,389
         This is how to karaoke.

386
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,991
This is impossible!             

387
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,592
We're never                     
gonna find it.                  

388
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,594
           Come on,             
      we just got here.         

389
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,997
    Why don't you go check      
one of those other bookcases?   

390
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,899
                Sensei?         

391
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,370
 How about grape and cherry?    
     Ooh, you know what?        

392
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,573
   Just squirt every flavor     
 you got on it zombie style.    

393
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,176
         - Ooh, yeah.           
      - Why'd you leave?        

394
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,745
    Got some cash? I don't      
get my allowance till Friday.   

395
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,780
        Oh, uh... here.         

396
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,118
      Fifty-one, 52, 53...      

397
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,920
                        Sensei? 
            What are you doing? 

398
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,255
      Dude, these chicks        
     totally dig my bike.       

399
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,257
     - Are you for real?        
           - What?              

400
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,560
    You don't really wanna      
 earn your red belt, do you?    

401
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,728
        Look, we tried          
        and we failed.          

402
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,564
        And that's okay.        

403
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,099
         It's not okay.         

404
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,234
      I actually wanted         
       to be like you,          

405
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,969
    but you're just like me,    

406
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,804
 except I'm not gonna end up    
         38 years old           

407
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,639
       and still living         
       with my parents.         

408
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,976
     - I'll see ya later.       
      - Where you going?        

409
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,979
 I'm going to find that tape    
     and get my red belt.       

410
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,215
Uh, bow to                      
your sensei.                    

411
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,817
                   I don't have 
              a sensei anymore. 

412
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,487
     So where am I gonna        
          look next?            

413
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,988
        I could check           
     more thrift stores,        

414
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,223
but what are the odds I'll...   
             oh!                

415
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,725
         Bump into it?          

416
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,096
           You are no cinephile.

417
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,798
                Next.           

418
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,168
I'm looking for a rare set of   
karate instructional tapes.     

419
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,837
   Finally. A customer who      
knows what he's talking about.  

420
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,006
 It's the How To Karate series. 

421
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,741
 The red belt tape.             

422
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:07,678
     Behold, the coveted        
 volume 8 red belt cassette.    

423
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,280
               Viewed only once.

424
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,817
      I've been looking         
      all over for you.         

425
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,185
                    Not without 
                gloves, please. 

426
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,953
     Okay. How much is it?      

427
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,956
       I will give you          
 the aficionado price. 2,400.   

428
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,491
           Dollars?!            

429
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,293
      I can't afford that.      

430
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:25,163
 Well, there is another way.    
       Fight me for it.         

431
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,032
    Really? Yeah, okay.         

432
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,908
       I'm not leaving          
      without that tape.        

433
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,944
         Hey, Marco.            
I'm still your sensei, right?   

434
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,751
    Sensei, he has the tape.    

435
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,763
          Mr. Diaz,             
      clip the toenail!         

436
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,172
      You... defeated me.       

437
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:44,141
       The tape is yours.       

438
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,913
  Can you ask him if he has     
     the How To Untangle        

439
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,349
      Multiple VHS Tapes        
          VHS tape.             

440
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,050
       No. Do you have          
     a pair of scissors?        

441
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,952
 Actually, we--                 

442
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,520
             Not the critically 
                      acclaimed 

443
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,888
                  award-winning 
                romantic comedy 

444
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,523
            <i> A Pair of Scissors.</i>

445
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,926
          An actual             
      pair of scissors.         

446
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,461
    No.                         

447
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,929
        It's okay, guys.        

448
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,964
           I'm done.            

449
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,432
       Go on without me.        

450
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,035
       - ( clattering )         
         - A hammer!            

451
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,803
        ( both sighing )        

452
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,573
       Now I just need          
     to find some nails.        

453
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,775
 Back to the store.
