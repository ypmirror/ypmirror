            GEMINI: Are you sure
            it's not locked?

00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,830

        There's my baby         
         bounty hunter.         

32
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:34,927
      You're growing back       
     so fast, yes, you are.     

33
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,929
         Yes, you are.          

34
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,599
      Now we are prepared       
     to wreak recrimination

          on our foes.

  Yes. Recrim-mim-mim-ination!  

37
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,044
             Hello?             

38
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,180
      Now are you convinced that
      parking meters aren't     
      filled with candy?        

39
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,216
It's all just                   
a big tease.                    

40
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:00,219
How was I supposed              
to know... oh.                  

41
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,288
       Okay, that was not       
       like that before.        

42
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,260
Okay, here's the plan.          

43
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,062
I'll cover the back door,       
and on my mark,                 

44
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:12,297
        - you bum rush          
        the front door.         
        - Got it.

             One...

47
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,643
          - Three.              
          - ( yells )           

48
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,645

49
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,180
            - Marco?            
            - You!              

50
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,115
              <i> You!</i>             

51
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,384
           - Get her.           
        - Narwhal blast.        

52
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,025
    Yeah! Get him, get him!     

53
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,227
What did you do                 
to my parents?                  

54
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,762
         Unhand me, you little--

55
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:47,166
Stop! Marco, let go             
of that poor old woman.         

56
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,767
    Wait. You're mad at us?     

57
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,335
          We're trying          
       to save you guys.        

58
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,004
We let her in.                  

59
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,273
You are both                    
being very rude.                

60
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,941
             Star, put away     
             your magical whale.

61
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,709
        It's a Narwhal.         

62
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,281
You, too, Marco.                
Let Miss Heinous go.            

63
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,016
But she's evil.                 

64
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,784
            - Now!              
            - Aahh!             

65
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,021
      This is the princess      
      who ruined my life.       

66
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,024
                That's right,   
                Princess Marco. 
                I recognize you.

67
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:15,127
       Even with your super-cute
       new haircut.             

68
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,728
What is going on here?          

69
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,897
This lady tied me               
to a chair,                     

70
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,133
and tried to                    
brainwash me.                   

71
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,701
                  That's a gross
                  exaggeration. 

72
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,237
Your child has                  
terribly wronged me,            

73
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,173
and I'm not going               
anywhere until justice          
is served.                      

74
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,375
But if she                      
doesn't leave...                

75
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,377
     Then how are we gonna      
      have dinner with...       

76
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,213
      BOTH: The Morrisons?      

77
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,715
             - Who?             
  - The Morrisons are so cool.  

78
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,717
  We've been on the wait list   
 to have them over for months.  

79
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,887
This dinner                     
needs to be perfect.            
We can't mess it up.            

80
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,823
        Wow. That sounds        
      really tough, guys.       

81
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:49,494
      You're gonna resolve      
    whatever issue you have     
  with Miss Heinous right now!  

82
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,063
       ( evil chuckling )       

83
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,231
          Here you go.          

84
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,499
           Thank you,           
         Your Highness.         

85
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,802
        What exactly is         
     your issue with Marco?     

86
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,971
                Gemini.         

87
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:02,307
          Once, I was           
the headmistress of St. Olga's, 

88
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:06,078
   the most esteemed princess   
   school in the multiverse.    

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,747
    It was a wonderful place    
  where delinquent princesses   

90
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,450
      were taught manners       
          and respect.          

91
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:14,920
         Until one day,         
an insolent princess showed up, 

92
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,090
 and inspired all the students  
 to rebel against their elders, 

93
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,858
        who knew better.        

94
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,793
      Princess Marco left,      

95
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,929
         but the school         
      was never the same.       

96
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,964
         They made her          
   the face of a revolution,    

97
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,966
  even inspiring merchandise,   

98
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,202
influencing the next generation 
      of young princesses       

99
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,937
     with her devious ways.     

100
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,405
           Wait a minute.       
           You have merchandise?

101
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,974
Yeah. I get a $650              
royalty check every month.      

102
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,542
        As I was saying,        

103
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,946
        my students lost        
   all respect for authority.   

104
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,248
Soon, they were cutting classes 
         just to party,         

105
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,284
     even inviting the boys     

106
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,819
       from a neighboring       
     prince reform school.      

107
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,289
       They threw me out.       

108
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,557
            And now,            
        I live in a car.        

109
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,926
          - BOTH: Oh!           
             - Oh!              

110
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,395
        Don't touch me.         

111
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,196
     And it's all thanks to     
        Princess Marco,         

112
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,098
    and her little sidekick,    
      Princess Butterfly.       

113
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,868
         Marco, is this         
           all true?            

114
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,504
   Well, yeah, but that place   
         was a prison.          

115
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,139
     Those princesses were      
        being oppressed.        

116
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,274
    They're way happier now.    

117
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,877
        And they blew up        
         my bodyguard.          

118
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,813
         Yeah, we were wondering
         what that was.         

119
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,816
 He's my dear, sweet Rasticore. 

120
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,951
     This is just his arm,      
     but he's part lizard,      

121
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,454
       so his whole body        
      will grow back soon.      

122
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,991
       And then he'll be        
 a big boy, won't you, sweetie? 

123
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,492
           ( groans )           

124
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,861
       So how shall we proceed, 
            Miss Heinous?       

125
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,164
       With a punishment        
  commensurate with the crime.  

126
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:37,035
  How about we annihilate her   
    and display her skeleton    

127
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,372
      as a warning against      
   any further insurrection?    

128
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,973
         Agreed? Good.          

129
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:45,243
    Now, Rasticore, bring me    
    Princess Marco's bones.     

130
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,384
           - Gemini.            
      - Yes. Yes, milady.       

131
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,319
        ( angry growls )        

132
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,322
     Okay, enough of this.      
        ( karate yell )         

133
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,491
   Gemini, Rasticore, attack!   

134
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,993
       Get ready to feel        
   the painous, Miss Heinous.   

135
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,595
                       No, Star.

136
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,898
           Excuse me.           
 Is this 4815 Avocado Terrace?  

137
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,500
          The police!           

138
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,969
          Yes, it is.           
   You're here just in time.    

139
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,872
      That lady is trying       
         to destroy me.         

140
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,943
   And that trollish-looking    
    guy-man-thing is totally    
          helping her.          

141
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,379
    Uh, just ignore the girl    
      waving a magic wand.      

142
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,514
       And it's probably        
        a lesser charge,        

143
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,183
  but this severed lizard arm   
       is complicit, too.       

144
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,452
         Well, that's something,
         all right.             

145
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,621
       Now if you'll all        
           stay calm,           

146
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,391
        I'm sure we can         
    clear this up right now.    

147
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,627
    Okay, I got a call about    
      a car double parked,      

148
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,596
   but, uh, since the wheels    
         of the top car         

149
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,599
      ain't on the ground,      
  that's not my jurisdiction.   

150
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,034
What? That's it?                
You're gonna ignore             

151
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,970
all the evil going on?          

152
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,206
       Evil. Evil. Evil!        

153
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,375
      Ho-ho, that doesn't       
        look dangerous.         

154
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,177
       It's one of those        
       animations, right?       

155
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,346
     You mean animatronics.     

156
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,115
          Listen, kid,          
   once there's a real crime,   

157
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,984
                 give me a call.

158
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,218
          ( growling )          

159
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,554
All right,                      
let the bargaining begin.       

160
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,957
 I leave if you let me rip out  
     Princess Marco's spine     

161
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,360
         and wear it as         
         a fancy scarf.         

162
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,929
Okay, that seems                
a little extreme.               

163
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,931
          Honey, we really don't
          have time for this.   

164
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,332
         The Morrisons are gonna
         be here soon,          

165
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,067
       and we haven't ' even    
       picked out the placemats.

166
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,171
 Um... what if we ground Marco  
          for a week?           

167
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:22,574
         Or you let me          
  grind her bones into a pulp.  

168
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,477
      - ( stammering )          
      - We won't let Marco      
      play video games.         

169
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,946
        Do you even know        
     how bargaining works?      

170
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,414
             No meat on Fridays.

171
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,450
Or even let me                  
disembowel her.                 

172
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,984
           He can do the dishes.

173
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,953
   What if I just apologize?    

174
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,289
                    An apology. 

175
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,990
                    Yes.        

176
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,626
   An apology will suffice...   

177
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,662
   under certain conditions.    

178
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,497
  ( relieved sigh )             

179
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,132
              Marco, you can't  
              give up that easy.

180
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,967
I'll do anything to get         
Heinous out of here.            

181
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,403
Whatever you want,              
Miss Heinous.                   
Just name it.                   

182
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,007
         Why did I day          
       whatever you want?       

183
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,309
       ( evil cackling )        

184
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,411
    It's finally happening.     

185
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,646
Let's see what those princesses 
    think of their idol now.    

186
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,083
I can't believe our son         
led a revolution                
and we didn't even know.        

187
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,486
       I'm not sure if          
       I should be mad or proud.

188
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,221
       Hang on, hang on.        

189
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:12,157
 A princess can't go on camera  
         without blush.         

190
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,059
Dude, don't do this.            

191
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,661
All those princesses,           
like, really look up to you.    

192
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,031
   I know. If I know a thing    
    or two about princesses,    

193
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,200
      it's gonna take a lot more
      than some dumb video      

194
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,169
         to break their spirits.

195
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,036
             Marco.             

196
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,172
       So how do I look?        

197
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,007
Super pretty.                   

198
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,475
     Enough dilly-dallying.     
     Let's get on with it.      

199
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:34,079
Just be careful.                

200
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,181
                 Gemini, are you
                 ready yet?     

201
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,382
    Yes, milady.                

202
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,684
And we're rolling.              

203
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,522
      Uh, hey, princesses       
       of the multiverse.       

204
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,423
     It's your girl Marco.      

205
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,725
        - What up?              
        - MOTHER: Psst.         

206
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,393
                      Morrisons.

207
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:52,030
   Anyway, last time I was at   
       St. Olga's school,       

208
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,034
   I said and did some stuff    
     that I shouldn't have.     

209
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,203
      And that was... bad.      

210
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,740
     And, um, I just wanted     
         to say, um...          

211
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,480
      I just wanted to say      
        that I'm, like,         

212
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,149
          super sorry           
      that I told you guys      

213
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,051
   to resist your oppressors    
           and stuff.           

214
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:17,088
    As princesses, we should    
   never think for ourselves,   

215
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,791
      and just, you know,       
     give up on our dreams      

216
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,760
   and our own individuality.   

217
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,461
      Oh, I mean all this       
  from the bottom of my heart.  

218
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,298
  And I'm definitely not just   
      saying that because       

219
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,767
 Miss Heinous is threatening me 
         and my family.         

220
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,268
      Okay, was that good?      

221
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,438
     Milady, I have notes.      

222
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,541
          ( laughing )          
     It's perfect. Perfect!     

223
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,244
Miss Heinous, we just           
want to apologize again         

224
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,313
for Marco's behavior.           

225
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,215
    Yes. We hope this can be    
  a fresh start for all of us.  

226
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,218
       Hm. We shall see.        

227
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,121
     Maybe this will inspire you
     to take a more active role 

228
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,790
           in your child's life.

229
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,792
FATHER:                         
Good-bye, Miss Heinous.         

230
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,493
                   Safe travels.

231
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,366
         Well, this was         
       a real eye-opener.       

232
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,235
       What else have you       
      been hiding from us?      

233
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,706
       Now is the time to       
      own up to any other       
  inter-dimensional chicanery.  

234
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,240
      Oh, no, no, no, no.       
       No chicanery here.       

235
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,209
All good.                       
Nothing to report.              

236
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,546
             I think we have    
             some responsibility
             to accept, too.    

237
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,282
            Maybe we haven't    
            been around enough  
            for the two of them.

238
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,651
                 We can start   
                fresh tonight.  

239
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,153
        I say we cancel         
   dinner with the Morrisons,   

240
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,289
          and instead,          
   have a family game night.    

241
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,157
        ( all cheering )        

242
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,629
     Who needs to hang out      
   with the Morrisons anyway?   

243
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,298
    The Diazes are so cool.     

244
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,368
          There you are, milady.

245
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,437
       Pillow's fluffed         
       just the way you like it.

246
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,140
Sweet dreams, milady.           

247
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,715
    And sweet dreams to you,    
      too, Princess Marco.      

248
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,884
    The fairest in the land.    

249
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,720
      Soon, the multiverse      
      will shiver in fear       

250
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,889
         once I destroy         
         Princess Marco         

251
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,824
    and Princess Butterfly.     

252
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,327
      With you at my side,      
          Rasticore...          

253
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,663
        Why, Rasticore.         

254
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,765
     You've grown an elbow.     

255
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,434
      You'll be a big boy       
          again soon.           

256
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,470
         So very soon.          

257
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,376
   Karate brings the essence    

258
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,713
       of ka, ra, and te        

259
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:25,383
 together in a circular balance 
        of the elements.        

260
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,952
       It is time for you       
         to demonstrate         

261
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:33,358
   all that you have learned    
  about the "DUH's" of karate.  

262
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,194
          Discipline.           

263
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,697
          Ed-U-cation.          

264
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,701
     And most importantly,      
             Honor.             

265
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,439
             Honor.             

266
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:53,344
       I, Grandmaster of        
the How To Karate video series, 

267
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:57,215
     am coming to your dojo     
       in your town of...       

268
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,953
   to watch your top student    
            perform.            

269
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,456
         If Grandmaster         
       deems them worthy,       

270
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,860
       your dojo will be        
           How To...            

271
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,296
     This is a great honor      
         for our dojo.          

272
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,598
       With Grandmaster's       
         certification,         

273
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,834
        we won't just be        
   a mini-mall dojo anymore.    

274
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,270
      We'll be a certified      
        mini-mall dojo.         

275
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:22,774
   The student I will choose    
    to represent the school     

276
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,877
    will be someone who has     
    constantly impressed me     

277
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,279
     with their dedication      
        and commitment.         

278
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,850
  Someone who has contributed   
      so much to the dojo,      

279
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:36,287
    who really puts the "ra"    
           in karate.           

280
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,724
I will let you know my decision 
    by the end of the week.     

281
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,893
Uh, sensei, it's Friday.        

282
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,027
     Oh. Then it's Jeremy.      

283
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,295
             What?!             

284
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,766
     ( nervous stammering )     

285
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,001
Anyway, great class today.      

286
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,770
You're all dismissed.           

287
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,005
               ( evil laughter )

288
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,940
        How does it feel, Marco?

289
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,043
     He actually chose          
     an eight-year-old over you.

290
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,379
                      L-o-s-e-r.

291
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,414
              Marco lost to who?

292
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,918
                    J-e-r-e-m-y.

293
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,319
             That spells winner.

294
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,455
                     That's me. 
                      Jeremy.   

295
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,592
    Yay! This is going to be    
       the best trip yet!       

296
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,294
Ready to board?                 

297
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,595
              You bet, Sir Acha.

298
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,532
        <i> Let's sail away</i>        
      <i> on our friend ship.</i>      

299
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,070
Hey, little buddy.              
What are you doing              
in my room?                     

300
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,007
    ( New Age music plays )     

301
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,411
                  <i> Hajime.</i>      

302
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,466
    Whoa. That was amazing.     

303
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,937
             So is Jeremy still 
             your choice to     
             represent the dojo?

304
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,438
    Yeah, for sure, Jeremy.     

305
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,508
     What?! I broke, like,      
         three boards.          

306
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,345
  Marco, I didn't pick Jeremy   
 because he's better at karate. 

307
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,347
   I picked him because of...   

308
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,515
      you know, who he is       
          as a person.          

309
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,518
   Who Jeremy is as a person    
           is a jerk.           

310
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,654
   ( muttering ) As a person?   
 Who do you think is a person?  

311
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,822
         Marco, listen.         

312
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,490
        No, you listen.         

313
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,426
    I'm ten times the person    
           Jeremy is.           

314
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,361
         You're making          
        a huge mistake.         

315
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,431
       <i> Let's sail away on</i>      
        <i> our friend ship.</i>       

316
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,566
           ( gasps )            

317
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:32,804
      You still have a lot      
     to learn about honor.      

318
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,139
             Fine.              

319
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,876
     Mom, next time you cut     
        the crusts off,         

320
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,844
     leave 'em in the bag.      

321
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,379
      Just 'cause I don't       
    want 'em on my sandwich     

322
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,047
      doesn't mean I don't      
         eat 'em later.         

323
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,816
       MOTHER: I'm sorry,       
       my little cherub.        

324
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,455
           Is that...           

325
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,156
That's a hundred-dollar bill.   

326
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,392
                   Really?      

327
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,561
Yeah.                           
That's a Benjamin.              

328
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,496
    That's my favorite one.     

329
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,832
          But it's got          
     all that stuff on it.      

330
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,901
Yeah, it's                      
a lot of stuff.                 

331
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,436
        You know how many vinyls
        I could buy with that?  

332
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,039
                       Three.   

333
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,974
                   I'm going in.

334
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,744
           Ew. Why does it smell
           like that?           

335
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,512
Pretty rank, huh?               

336
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,581
             Well, maybe if I...

337
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,983
I'd start with                  
the corner.                     

338
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,089
       Man. Somebody glued this 
            to the ground.      

339
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,891
Glue?                           

340
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,093
       What kind of a sick joke 
               is this?         

341
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,495
Try the other corner.           

342
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,435
           My glasses.          
           And it's my birthday!

343
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,608
      Uh, butler, refill.       

344
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,519
         - Shameful.            
         - Hey, Marco,          
         whatcha doing?         

345
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,087
                    Do you mind?

346
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,822
                  I'm collecting
                  evidence here.

347
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,624
( gasps )                       
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.     

348
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,492
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.     

349
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,061
      Keep it up, Jeremy.       

350
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,063
        You're giving me        
       everything I need.       

351
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,232
          ( rustling )          
  - Star? What are you doing?   

352
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,168
      I'm just helping you out  
      at the scene of the crime,

353
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,805
            collecting evidence.

354
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,808
Uh, it's not really             
a crime scene.                  

355
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,578
I'm hiding in the bushes        
and recording all of Jeremy's   
bad behavior.                   

356
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,847
         Oh, so you're like a...
         like a...              

357
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,515
                   like a creep.

358
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,951
What? No.                       
I'm not a creep.                

359
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,554
I've got lots                   
of proof here, Star.            

360
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,489
               It's okay, Marco.

361
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,957
           Wave that creep flag.

362
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,493
This isn't creepy.              
This is justice.                

363
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,695
I'm gonna show                  
all this bad stuff to sensei,   

364
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,564
             and then he'll have
             to change his mind 

365
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,632
            about letting Jeremy
            represent the dojo. 

366
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,041
              Huh?              

367
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,616
( karate yells )                

368
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,852
 Hey, sensei.                   

369
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,687
                   Mr. Diaz.    

370
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,655
       There's something        
      I need to show you.       

371
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,558
   If it's those pictures of    
 the dog playing the harmonica, 

372
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,795
          I've seen them,       
          and they're excellent.

373
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,864
No, no,                         
this is not that.               

374
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,866
It's about Jeremy.              

375
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,300
               Okay. What is it?

376
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,269
      I wanna show you...       

377
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,305
             how...             

378
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,641
             Well?              

379
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,878
             How...             
          sorry I am.           

380
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,781
I shouldn't have                
overreacted the other day.      

381
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,716
You have every right            
to choose who you want          

382
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,584
to represent the dojo.          

383
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,686
And if you really think         
Jeremy is the best choice,      

384
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,189
then I can accept that.         

385
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,924
                   I appreciate 
                   your apology.

386
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,893
                   It shows your
                   noble spirit.

387
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,729
     You're like a lion,        
     or a really cool bird-lion.

388
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,764
      - ( watch beeping )       
           - Oh, man!           

389
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,133
             Grandmaster's gonna
             be here any minute.

390
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:53,838
       Or is Grandmaster        
         already here?          

391
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,173
        ( all gasping )         

392
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,709
           Grandmaster.         
           Thank you for coming.

393
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,012
   Do not thank Grandmaster.    

394
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:04,582
       It is by the will        
           of karate            

395
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,818
   that Grandmaster is here.    

396
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,187
  That's the coolest sentence   
        I've ever heard.        

397
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,325
      Who have you chosen       
    to represent your dojo?     

398
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,862
          Me! Jeremy!           

399
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,765
          Yay. We love you, son.

400
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,739
    I would like to express     
    what a huge honor it is     

401
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:32,243
         for all of you         
      to watch me perform.

        - Yes, sweetie.         

409

What a jerk!                    

410
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,001
I cannot stand                  
that boy.                       

411
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,070
Why'd you bring me here         
  for our anniversary           

412
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,877
No, I'm not done.               

413
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,779
        Okay, that's it.        

414
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,748
I'm sorry, sensei.              

415
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,016
I just can't                    
accept this.                    

416
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,985
Why did you pick Jeremy?        

417
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,854
   Because he brings so much    
          to the dojo.          

418
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,189
         So much what?          

419
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,057
                 Money, dude.   

420
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,692
                    His family's
                    filthy rich.

421
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,394
              They give the dojo
              tons of cash.     

422
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,929
              That's how I keep 
              this place afloat.

423
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,732
           I really shouldn't be
           running a business.  

424
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,700
So, wait.                       

425
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,702
You don't think                 
he's a better person than me?   

426
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,838
              No. Of course not.
              He's a toilet.    

427
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,339
       Jeremy, Jeremy...        

428
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,775
Why didn't you tell me          
this in the first place?        

429
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,211
              Because you and I 
                 are friends,   

430
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,079
     and that's what friends do.

431
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,715
          They do hurtful things
          to each other,        

432
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,217
         without explaining why,

433
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,187
   because they know            
   their friend will understand.

434
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,856
    That's not how... wait.     
         We're friends?         

435
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,058
        Duh. You're my dojo bro.

436
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,260
      Why else would I keep     
      texting you to grab tacos?

437
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,062
You don't text me.              

438
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,764
      Whose number is this then?

439
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,733
  For the record, friends are   
   up front with each other.    

440
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,169
      Really? I gotta stop      
     learning life lessons      

441
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,737
     from children's shows.     

442
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,707
         I'm so ignorant in     
         the ways of friendship.

443
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,710
           Perhaps you could be 
           my friendship sensei.

444
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,213
I'd be honored.                 

445
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,117
        ( loud snoring )        

446
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,889
        Yes. Uh... yes.         

447
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,891
          Yes, indeed,          
          yes, indeed.          

448
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,727
     Wonderful performance.     
Just wow. Wow all across the... 

449
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,861
         But I wasn't even done.

450
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,763
                Yes, Grandmaster
                gets the gist.  

451
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,865
             Punch, punch,      
             kick, kick.        
             Very good, William.

452
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,734
          It's Jeremy.          

453
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,736
           This dojo            
       has proven itself        

454
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,807
           worthy of            
  Grandmaster's certification.  

455
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:54,852
       The wind of karate       
      beckons once again.       

456
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,054
      Grandmaster must go.      

457
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,892
How did he do that?             

458
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,928
             Huh. Grandmaster   
            is like the wind.   

459
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,931
        He is not bound         
        by physical constraints.

460
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,532
                You can't leave 
                the Grandmaster!

461
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,336
Looks good.                     

462
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,971
                     Sure does. 

463
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,942
        ( phone buzzes )        

464
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,944
"Let's go grab some tacos."     

465
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:23,247
Someone invited me              
to get tacos.                   
Wanna come, too?                

466
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,116
                           Sure.

467
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,287
                You wanna go get
                some ice cream? 

468
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,456
       No? You wanna go glue    
       some hundred-dollar bills

469
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,959
                  to the ground?

470
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,461
              Yeah? Okay.
