      Math, is a symphony...

00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,693
  It's the poetry of logic.     

23
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,996
    The magic behind nature.

  The beauty of sea shells.

                    Hey, Star.

Uh-huh.

I don't know.                   

30
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,607

Miss Skullnick, get this.       

34
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,617
She said                        
"to get to the other side."     

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,952

Get it?                         

36
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,021
Ah, you expect                  
the punch line                  
to be one thing,                

37
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,789
but what you                    
end up with                     
is just logic.                  

38
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,357
Classic anti-humor.

  Hey, stop messing around.     

40
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,761
     I need to know this        
     for tomorrow's test.       

41
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,329
     OK, Miss Butterfly,        

42
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,598
    if you are so enamored      
         with logic,            

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,167
  why don't you get up here     
      and solve for "c"?        

44
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,235
              Ooh!              

45
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,771
   Oh, relax, people. Mmm.

00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,208
       ( humming a tune )       

47
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,843
 Thank you.                     

48
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,045
 OK...ahem!                     

49
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,048
      And "c" equals...         

50
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,182
cat face!                       

51
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,851
 ( gasp ) Cat face!             

52
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,786
 I walk back to desk.           

53
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,788
                What? No, Star, 

54
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,189
             "c" equals         
             the circumference. 

55
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,858
            You just drew a cat!

56
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,093
Yeah, but I don't               
just draw cats.                 

57
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,696
I draw rainbows,                
lightning bolts,                

58
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:11,797
   hamburgers.                  

59
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,699
I don't know where              
this stuff comes from.          

60
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,801
            Star.               
 Might draw a chicken later.    

61
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,802
            Star!               

62
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,070
Depends on how bored I get.     

63
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,638
             Get up here        
             and solve for "c." 

64
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,806
 I got nothin'!                 

65
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,075
( growl )                       
I'm so bad at math.             

66
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,410
  No one is going anywhere,     

67
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,746
    until you come up here      
 and solve this math problem.   

68
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,682
         ( mocking )            
   Solve this math problem.     

69
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,251
        ( groans ) Fine.        

70
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,355
       ( humming a tune )       

71
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,657
             Ta-da!             

72
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,092
          ( sighs )             

73
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,961
            Uh...               

74
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,763
      ( clock ticking )         

75
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,768
     Star, what's going on?     

76
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,836
             Ah!                

77
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,241
                     Huh?       

78
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,976
            Uh...               

79
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,278
      ( exasperated sigh )      

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,846
        OK, let's just          
     get this over with.        

81
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,982
                    Hey, Star.  

82
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,384
            Why did the chicken 
            cross the road?     

83
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,385
What?                           

84
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,687
        To ask out the rooster. 

85
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,356
Uh, didn't we                   
just go through this?           

86
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,025
            What?               
        Uh, that joke.          

87
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,793
You just told me                
it a minute ago.                

88
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,695
 But it was a little different. 

89
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,796
    What are you talking about? 

90
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:18,997
And where                       
did you get that hat?           

91
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,867
           Is there something   
           you want to tell us? 

92
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,901
 Yes, there is.                 

93
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,203
What the heck is going on here? 

94
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,071
Hey, stop messing around.       

95
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,073
I need to know this             
for tomorrow's exam.            

96
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,342
 I'll tell you what the heck    
      is going on, Star.        

97
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,212
 You're going to get up here    
      and solve for "c."        

98
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,379
              Ooh!              

99
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,048
Miss Skullnick,                 
I already told you.             

100
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,749
 I don't know how to do it.     

101
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,851
         ( angrily )            
     Get up here and try!       

102
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,853
            Are you feeling OK? 

103
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,422
          ( coughing )          

104
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,327
But, Skullzy,                   
I don't know the answer.        

105
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,728
          ( rumbling )          

106
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,364
     Because that's where       
     she parked the car.        

107
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,367
Hey, are you guys all           
messing with me or something?   

108
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,236
    What are you talking about? 

109
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,971
  Hey, stop messing around.     

110
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,039
     I need to know this        
   for my homework tonight.     

111
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,041
I thought you said              
it was for tomorrow's exam.     

112
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,409
              Huh?              

113
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,312
      Get up here now           
      and solve for "c."        

114
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,413
              Ooh!              

115
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,315
Knock it off                    
with the "oohs."                

116
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,750
Miss Skullnick,                 
I already told you,             

117
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,751
I have no idea                  
what the answer is.             

118
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,885
           ( rumbling )         

119
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,822
     Because she flew the coop. 
     ( laughs )                 

120
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,090
 What is happening?             

121
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,458
And why do you keep             
wearing these terrible hats?!   

122
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,926
                      Hey!      

123
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,894
            How dare you        
            interrupt my class! 

124
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,197
     Stop messing around.       
  I need to know this for--     

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,398
Oh, just can it, Marco.         

126
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,934
       Get up here now          
      and solve for "c."        

127
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,836
This is no time for math.       

128
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,404
I need to find a way out        
of this nightmare.              

129
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,872
         ( rumbling )           
         Oh, come on!           

130
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,541
         Because it wanted      
         to lead by egg-zample. 

131
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,876
        Solve for "c."          
            Never!              

132
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,278
           ( thud )             
         ( rumbling )           

133
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,047
             Just 'beak-cause'. 
             You know, beaks.   

134
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,949
        Solve for "c."          
             No!                
         ( rumbling )           

135
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,884
            Because she         
            didn't chicken out. 

136
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,853
        Solve for "c."          
             No!                
         ( rumbling )           

137
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,055
        Because she was chicken 
        out the other side.     

138
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,923
        Solve for "c"!          
             No!                
         ( rumbling )           

139
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,058
             Because she needed 
             the exercise.      

140
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,893
                  Solve for "c."

141
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,094
           ( rumbling )         

142
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,963
          ( speaking            
      foreign language )        

143
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,531
        Solve for "c."          
             No!                
         ( rumbling )           

144
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,433
  ( speaking indistinctly )     
        Solve for "c."          

145
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,434
             No!                
         ( rumbling )           

146
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,869
          ( clucking )          

147
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,103
        Solve for "c."          
           No way!              

148
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,104
  To get away from the farmer.  

149
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,539
( screaming )                   

150
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,441
Stop it with the chicken jokes. 
They're not funny.              

151
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:09,441
                  Star!         

152
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,544
      What in the world         
   is going on back there?      

153
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,980
     Stop messing around.       
  I need to know this for--     

154
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,281
      The test tomorrow! I know!

155
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,282
Oh, no. There's a test?         

156
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,817
                  Get up here...

157
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,319
         ( together )           
    ...and solve for "c."       

158
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,120
Oh, Miss Skullnick.             

159
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,823
( laughs nervously )            
OK, gotta go.                   

160
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,058
 I gotta figure this thing out. 

161
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,262
      Hey, Father Time!         

162
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,264
          Father Time?          

163
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,199
           Father?              

164
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,101
       Father... Ooh!           

165
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:40,005
 ( humming a tune )             

166
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,206
                      STAR: Hey!

167
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,975
          Father Time!          

168
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,877
  You're stuck in my wheel.     

169
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,112
 Can you help me?               

170
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,482
                I ran over you. 

171
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,884
I'm stuck in some kind          
of weird time loop,             

172
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,152
and I can't figure              
a way out of it!                

173
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,187
             OK!                

174
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,555
           Ya-haw!              

175
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,457
       Wait, I can't figure out 
       what's happening!        

176
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,192
        I need your--           
        ( screaming )           

177
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,027
        ( grunts )              

178
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,894
            Help!               

179
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,899
           ( groans )           

180
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,035
       I gotta find way         
         to end this!           

181
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:10,035
              MAN:              
             <i> What do you need?</i> 

182
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,038
        Who said that?          
       MAN: <i> I said it.</i>         

183
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,209
      What do you need?         

184
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,944
     I need Father Time.        

185
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,245
  I'm stuck in a time loop.     

186
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,981
 OK, now, you don't need him.   
       He's time-time.          

187
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,449
       I'm space-time.          

188
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,884
          Who are you?          

189
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,919
    I'm Omnitraxus Prime.       

190
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,021
   I'm the space-time guy.      

191
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,557
        The time loop,          
     that's my territory.       

192
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,359
   It's a space-time problem.   

193
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,395
         Father Time problem is 
         like,                  

194
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:39,398
   "I burnt this toast that     
   I really wanted to eat."     

195
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,665
            Look.               
        "Oh, dang" it.          

196
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,267
            I burnt this toast. 

197
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,569
 I wish I could go back         
 in time before it was burnt.   

198
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,037
           I need--             
      That kinda thing.         

199
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,406
      I need some answers.      

200
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:48,540
          I am stuck            
  in a nightmare math class     

201
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,075
    that's repeating itself,    

202
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,977
           but now              
     it's changing, too.        

203
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,245
 Like, super weird changing.    

204
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,580
             OK. What's it keep 
             returning to?      

205
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,082
The same stupid math problem.   

206
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,383
                    Oh, well... 

207
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,985
              why don't you     
              just do the math? 

208
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,053
  Omnitraxus Prime has spoken.  

209
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,288
W-w-w-w-w-w-wait.               

210
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,356
 I did do the math.             

211
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,690
              Hmm?              

212
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,093
Miss Skullnick wants me         
to do the work.                 

213
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,629
     OK, so do the work.        

214
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,632
  Omnitraxus Prime has spoken.  

215
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,167
 I can't.                       

216
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,302
   ( groans ) I have a ton      
    of things to do today.      

217
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,670
      I can't do the work.      

218
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,472
    I never paid attention      
          in class.             

219
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,973
    I tried to use my wand      
         to solve it,           

220
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,475
        but I ended up          
 right back where I started.    

221
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,177
          Oof. Look...          

222
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,611
         I can see              
         what's happening here. 

223
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,979
          I can show you        
          how to sort this out. 

224
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,348
           But there's gonna be 
           some tummy-time.     

225
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa.               
Hold on a second.               

226
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,350
              Get up in my guts.

227
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,418
 Nice.                          

228
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,189
    Whoa, it's neat in here.    

229
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,659
Mm-hmm. So...                   

230
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,528
all time and space are          
considered as one.              

231
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,965
And within it, infinite         
parallel universes exist--      

232
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,233
             Bored!             

233
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,634
           I'm bored.           

234
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,970
I can't believe                 
this is happening.              

235
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,072
Let me explain this             
another way. Hmm.               

236
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:58,143
In the crystal fields           
of interwoven continuum.        

237
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,144
           ( gasps )            

238
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,445
           So pretty.           

239
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,113
 Ah, you see?                   

240
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,052
Here is infinite                
versions of you                 

241
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,521
 in infinite parallel timelines 

242
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:13,091
in infinite parallel            
math classes.                   

243
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,026
       Ohh! I'm adorable.       

244
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,528
OMNITRAXUS: And all             
those versions of you           

245
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,530
managed to work                 
through that problem.           

246
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:23,468
You're the only version         
of you that didn't do it.       

247
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,337
          ( rumbling )          

248
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,038
          That sound!           
          That's the same sound 
          from the classroom!   

249
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,642
That's your parallel timelines  
colliding with each other.      

250
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,378
If you don't figure out         
that math problem soon,         

251
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,315
they're all gonna shatter       
and forever be lost within      
the fabric of time-space.       

252
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,017
Uh, space-time.                 

253
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,719
         Oh, I know.            

254
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,488
    I bet you're great at math. 
    You can solve it for me!    

255
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,358
Did-- Are you even              
listening to me?                

256
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,094
There's no short cuts           
to this.                        

257
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,395
 Answer the math problem,       

258
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,464
or your world's                 
gonna fall apart.               

259
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,633
Just do the work, Star.         

260
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,067
          Do the work?          

261
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,075
     Why did the chicken        
     cross the road?            

262
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,644
           Who cares?           

263
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,046
 There are infinite chickens    
 crossing infinite roads, OK?   

264
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,415
         So why don't           
      you just ask them?        

265
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,550
           ( groans )           

266
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,752
 ( gasps ) Hold on. That's it.  

267
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:17,255
 If all the infinite versions   
 of me know how to solve        
 that math problem,             

268
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,158
       then I must know         
 how to solve it, too, right?   

269
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,060
           Uh, it's just a joke 
           about a chicken.     

270
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,229
Miss Skullnick,                 
I would like to solve for "c."  

271
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,399
    Star, are you feeling well? 

272
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,200
Perfectly fine,                 
( baby voice) Miss Skullnick.   

273
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,402
( old woman's voice )           
I have a math problem...        

274
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,469
( normal voice )                
to solve.                       

275
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,771
 Come on, Star.                 

276
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,606
You can do this.                
( growls )                      

277
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,710
  ( rumbling and crashing )     

278
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,249
     OK, infinite me's in       
infinite parallel dimensions,   

279
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,717
         let's do this.         

280
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,486
I already know how to do this   
   in the other dimensions,     

281
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,556
        so I just need          
    to channel those me's.      

282
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,461
        OK, lets see.           

283
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,330
         Solve for "c."         

284
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,631
          Well, first,          

285
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,867
        16 minus 7.0.           

286
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,270
          ( shouting )          

287
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,106
  ( speaking indistinctly )     

288
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,708
  ..which means that "c"...     

289
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,810
     ( continues speaking       
        indistinctly )          

290
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,820
  ( speaking indistinctly )     

291
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,890
  Meow meow meow meow meow.     

292
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,793
  ...to the fourth power...     

293
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,329
    divided by root of "c"      
           over 12,             

294
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,466
 and therefore "c" equals...    

295
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,302
        Seven. Seven?           

296
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,503
          Yeah, seven.          

297
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,908
 Yes, I did it!                 

298
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,144
                  Hmm, wow!     

299
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,313
          Yep,                  
          you did it all right. 

300
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,315
I know!                         
I solved the problem!           

301
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,484
            Well, no, I mean,   
            it's totally wrong. 

302
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,720
               But you tried,   
               so it's a start. 

303
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,556
                Nice job, Star. 

304
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,325
            Now take your seat, 
            please.             

305
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,162
            MARCO:              
  Star, don't feel too bad.     

306
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,864
  It's pretty complicated stuff.

307
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,332
           Oh, Marco,           

308
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,167
      You have no idea.         

309
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,337
         Mr. Diaz, get up here. 
         It's your turn.        

310
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,273
         ( wailing )            

311
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,277
                  Uh, Pony Head?

312
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,247
           What's wrong?        

313
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,217
Oh, no!                         

314
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,353
          Pony, use your words. 

315
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,522
          Hyah-cha!             
      I heard screaming.        

316
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,691
            Oh, it's Pony Head. 

317
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,559
   What, did she run out of     
  rainbow toothpaste again?     

318
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,327
      Yeah, probably.           

319
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,530
       Whatever it is,          
we'll go through it together.   

320
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,465
( sobbing )                     

321
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,568
OK, I'll tell you.              
I am ready to reveal.           

322
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,873
The Bounce Lounge is closing.   

323
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,375
         ( wailing )            

324
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,980
    ( wailing continues )       

325
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,215
      ( glasses break )         

326
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,452
      ( Star coughing )         

327
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:03,588
         ( sobbing )            

328
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:09,260
      The Bounce Lounge         
      is cl-cl-closing?!        

329
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,395
                        No! No! 

330
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,298
        Hey, let's not          
   get ahead of ourselves.      

331
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,834
        It's probably           
 not even closing. I mean...    

332
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,503
  since when has Pony Head      
  been right about anything?    

333
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,605
 ( gasp ) Oh, yeah.             

334
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,240
      MARCO: It's closing.      

335
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,576
I just...                       
I can't believe it.             

336
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,910
                   WOMAN:       
                   <i> Believe it.</i> 

337
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,281
       ( dance music )          

338
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,753
PONY HEAD: ( gasps )            
Oh, my goodness!                

339
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,355
    It's Millie Sparkles.       

340
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,857
          My liege.             

341
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,559
    Marco, it is the owner      
    of the Bounce Lounge.       

342
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,395
      The Bounce Lounge         
      is indeed closing.        

343
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,264
              The party is over.

344
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,266
        But why, Millie?        

345
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,703
Because business has been slow. 

346
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,304
           ( cawing )           

347
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,373
       <i> No one comes to</i>         
     <i> party here anymore.</i>       

348
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,276
Fare thee well, loyal partiers. 

349
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,845
  And may the Bounce Lounge     
        be with you...          

350
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,781
           always.              

351
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,317
     Wow, you girls used        
     to party here a lot.       

352
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,353
   ( gasps ) Hey, Pony, look!   

353
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,687
 It's us!                       

354
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,790
       STAR: Oh, besties!       

355
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,860
Mmm, and there's                
our junior prom night.          

356
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,529
              Uh, yeah.         

357
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,497
            I'm actually trying 
            to forget that.     

358
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,300
O.M.G. That is a classic!       

359
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,602
'Cause that is                  
the old Bounce Crew, girl!      

360
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,437
We used                         
to rule this place.             

361
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,339
Nobody partied harder           
than we did.                    

362
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,308
    Man, where did the time go? 

363
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,410
Actually, time doesn't          
go anywhere.                    

364
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,945
 Sometimes things just end,     

365
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,513
and there's nothing             
we can do but accept it.        

366
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,448
        Please be quiet.        

367
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,450
    Because Star and I are      
trying to have a life moment.   

368
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,820
           We haven't been here 
           for so long.         

369
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,422
        I can't help but feel   
        like this is our fault. 

370
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,391
And now a part of our life      
has gone forever.               

371
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,859
( muffled sob )                 

372
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,360
                  Unless...     

373
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:53,631
     we get the old Bounce Crew 
     back together.             

374
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, girl!                       

375
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,636
              STAR: Hey, Kelly. 

376
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,006
              Uh... where's Ted?

377
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,509
     Ted and I broke up.        

378
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:09,347
There's a bald spot on my head  
  where my heart used to be.    

379
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,350
                Oof, that's,    
                like, real sad! 

380
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,520
             And worse news,    
             they are closing   
             the Bounce Lounge! 

381
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,922
  And we're getting the crew    
  back together to save it.     

382
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,725
              Puh!              

383
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,361
     Why not? I can be          
     despondent anywhere.       

384
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,495
               All right,       
               let's go, Kelly! 

385
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,064
                    Who's next? 

386
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:30,535
Johnny Blowhole,                
the party dare extraordinaire.  

387
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,137
  JOHNNY: I don't know, guys.   

388
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,672
          ( claps )             
   I have a lot of partying     

389
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,408
   that I have to do here.      

390
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,877
OK, you do not look like        
you're the one partying.        

391
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,145
     No, I'm pretty sure        
     this is partying.          

392
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,515
              When you're done, 
              grab your mop.    

393
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,518
      The commode could use     
      some heavy duty partying. 

394
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,553
        ( both gasp )           

395
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,488
              He's forgotten    
              what partying is. 

396
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,156
             They're using you, 
             Johnny.            

397
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,826
Yeah, ditch these nerds         
and you need to come with us.   

398
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,394
         Sorry, ladies.         

399
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,463
     Johnny stays with me.      

400
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,533
        ( nervously )           
    Uh... uh... uh... Hey!      

401
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,601
        ( crunching )           
        ( screaming )           

402
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,069
      This is my life now.      

403
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,739
         I'm not good           
 at partying anymore anyways.   

404
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,507
 I guess, you're right, Johnny. 

405
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,643
        You have lost           
    your partying powers.       

406
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,745
   You probably never even      
 had them in the first place.   

407
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:17,582
Oh, you lost them,              
Johnny Blowhole! That's weak!   

408
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,951
   You guys are wrong, OK?      
      I have my moments.        

409
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:23,788
Prove it. I dare you to         
save the Bounce Lounge.         

410
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,124
     I dare you to stop me!     

411
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,425
          ( laughing )          

412
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,127
 Whoo! Johnny's back!           

413
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,797
         PONY: Headphone Jones? 
         Lady Scarfs-a-lot?     

414
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:32,797
                    Yo, wake up!

415
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,503
      What do you want?         
      And make it quick.        

416
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,737
      You're harshing the cool. 

417
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,573
They're closing                 
the Bounce Lounge.              

418
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,875
     Good.                      

419
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,743
        Yeah, that place hasn't 
        been cool in months.    

420
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,546
           We were getting      
           the crew back        
           together to save it. 

421
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,082
     This is a way cooler       
     place to party.            

422
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,717
This is partying?               

423
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,019
       HEADPHONE: Yeah,         
    look how cool we look.      

424
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,989
             You thinking       
             what I'm thinking? 

425
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,057
 Uh-huh.                        

426
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,793
          ( siren )             

427
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:05,029
What?! I thought that was       
what you were thinking!         

428
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,532
         Ah, Millie!            
   Millie, Millie, Millie!      

429
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,200
              The Bounce Crew   
              is back together. 

430
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,603
                  Wassup, Mills?

431
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,973
  I'm afraid that's not enough. 

432
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,508
  You see, the only thing       
  that will save the lounge     

433
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,644
 is paying off the mortgage.    

434
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:24,015
And I can't do that with only   
 one, two, three, four, five,   

435
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:27,552
         six customers.         

436
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,686
           Well,                
           how much do you owe? 

437
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,722
   Like, a bajillion dollars.   

438
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,223
 That's a lot of bacon.         

439
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,524
            Is that             
            even a real number? 

440
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,159
      Let it go, darlings.      

441
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,861
   Sometimes things just end.   

442
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,664
     And there's nothing        
   we can do but accept it.     

443
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,132
 That is so deep,               

444
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,067
so new, so unique.              
Nobody ever said that before.   

445
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,803
             Seriously?         
             That's the exact   
             same thing I said. 

446
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,572
No, no, sorry.                  
I don't remember                
you saying that.                

447
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:51,175
  So, goodbye and thank you     
     for your patronage.        

448
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,278
                ( sighs )       

449
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,881
          It's no wonder        
          the place lost money. 

450
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,218
                    What a dump!

451
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,986
              It always         
              looked like this. 

452
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,589
    Our partying gave           
    the Bounce Lounge its life. 

453
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,691
       And our partying         
      is gonna save it.         

454
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,593
 Save it? What?                 

455
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,128
         No, no, no,            
         she's right.           

456
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,929
The Bounce Lounge can't go down 

457
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,264
  with the Bounce Crew around.  

458
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,532
        Hit it, Pony.           

459
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,002
   ( electronic party music )   

460
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,773
Let's get this party started!   

461
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,592
  Come on, Bounce Crew,         
  what are you waiting for?     

462
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,598
 Hey, I heard some dance music. 

463
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,599
  Is there a party in here?     

464
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,802
 Yes, admission is $25.         

465
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,204
         Oh, no, I just need to 
         use your bathroom.     

466
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
              How many is that? 

467
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,341
    None!                       

468
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,110
             Looks like we need 
             to dance harder.   

469
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,316
       WOMAN:                   
       Let's get our groove on! 

470
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:07,618
      Oh! It's working!         

471
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,989
  Whoo! Move to the groove!     
             Yes!               

472
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,926
    How many is that now?       

473
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,728
Almost a bajillion              
less than a bajillion.          

474
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,930
                        Harder! 

475
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,132
           JOHNNY:              
You heard Star, dance harder!   

476
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,166
      PONY: That's what         
      I'm talking about!        

477
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,267
            Whoo!               

478
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,635
              Now?              

479
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,104
We're gonna need                
a lot more partiers.            

480
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,072
              You are so right. 

481
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,774
 Get in there, Marco!           

482
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,809
 Just move your body!           

483
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,711
 Be yourself.                   

484
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,646
           Myself?              

485
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,652
           Hi-yah!              

486
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:45,123
      ( karate sounds )         

487
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,727
   This goes out to all you     
desert dimensioners out there!  

488
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,399
         Whoo! Yeah!            

489
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,403
      How about, MC Money?      

490
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,043
       Let's hear it!           
       Make some noise!         

491
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,848
     We still need more!        

492
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,384
Johnny,                         
use your blow hole!             

493
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,789
  We were passing by outside    
       and got sprayed.         

494
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,924
   The Bounce Lounge is back!   

495
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,827
                            Now?

496
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,096
  We need one more partier.     

497
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,832
         One more?              
         Think that's everyone. 

498
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,369
             Ted?               
             Ted?               

499
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,804
               Oh, hey, guys.   
               Where's my girl? 

500
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,909
              Ted.              

501
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,978
 What are you doing here?       

502
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,780
      Don't you remember, baby? 

503
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,982
        This is the first place 
        we ever broke up.       

504
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,684
        Wanna get back together?

505
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,754
Yeah!                           

506
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,824
         BOTH: Whoa!            

507
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,027
Did we make enough?             

508
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,896
           One, three, fifteen, 
           eleventy, thirty,    

509
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,999
              Mmm, nope.        
              We're short 6.50. 

510
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,367
 But I thought we had--         

511
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,036
    ( giggling ) Wait! Oh...    

512
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,405
   I've never had more fun      
      in my entire life!        

513
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,707
          ( cheering )          

514
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,742
Yes, we did it!                 

515
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:15,012
The Bounce Lounge lives forever!
Now let's party!                

516
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,348
            MILLIE: Star, wait. 

517
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,884
    Thank you, all of you,      
    for what you've done.       

518
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:24,155
    But I've been partying      
    for over 5,000 years.       

519
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,990
 ( gasps and shocked cries )    

520
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,858
It was never about the mortgage.

521
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,762
          I'm closing the lounge

522
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,333
    because I just really       
    need to stop partying.      

523
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,801
                Like, right now.

524
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,202
              Aww!              

525
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,837
  If this is the last night     
    of the Bounce Lounge,       

526
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,740
        let's make it           
     the best night ever!       

527
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,841
       ( excited whoops )       

528
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,309
             No!                

529
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,744
       The party is over.       

530
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,083
        ( screaming )           

531
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,788
        But we saved the lounge.

532
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,024
Nothing lasts                   
forever, princess.              

533
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,126
 But thank you for the party.   

534
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,304
           ( sighs )            

535
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,039
 The Bounce Lounge is gone.     

536
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,173
            ( dolphin chatter ) 

537
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,377
    Uh, at least I have you,    

538
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,846
         piece of gum           
    I scraped off a table       

539
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,215
      to remember it by.        
           ( kiss )             

540
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,917
      Yeah. I got a chip        
     of the dance floor.        

541
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,219
            Or someone's tooth. 

542
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,888
  PONY: Aw, you guys are lucky. 

543
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,958
 All I got is this photo booth! 

544
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,926
STAR:                           
Photo booth! Photo booth!
