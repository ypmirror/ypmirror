that you let me write           
in you this instant,

It's just that you have         
something I want,               

167
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,019

I did or I said, I-I...

to come right out and say it.

   Yes. She'll never make it

     Oh, no. Now I lock you     
        on the balcony.

It's okay.                      

367
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,903
Just unlock the door.

              together, man!

00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,351
Moon should never               
have left me in charge.         

373
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,153
"The people love you,"          
she said.                       

374
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,722
"Keep them happy

And now, because of me,         
the kingdom is defenseless!

              [party horn toots]

377
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,764
Moon didn't even tell me        
where she was taking Star.      

378
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,199
What if something               
happened to them?               

379
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,234
No wonder I want                
to party all the time.

I'm worried sick!

               I'm worried, too.

            Do you have any idea
            when she'll be back?

384
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,744
It's funny                      
you should ask, Marco.

00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,212
Let me show you something.      

386
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,580
    Whenever Moon goes away,    

387
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,216
    she always puts together    
     a few outfits for me,      

388
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,351
     so I know what to wear     
       while she's gone.        

389
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,953
    But-- But look at this!     

390
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,456
                  She's got them
                  piled up

00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,624
          all the way           
    to the top of the room.

00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,394
           [chuckles]           
        So it's probably        

393
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:20,031
     she's not coming back

I see what you're saying.

         to go lead your people.

They've                         
never hated me before.

              It doesn't matter.

     Okay, I deserved that.

 Look, if the Queen were here,  

415

       she'd fix all this

    we should cower in fear.

   We still have each other,
