20
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,156
   Huh.                         

21
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,725
Authentic Mexican horchata      
isn't supposed to have          
dairy in it.                    

22
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,360
                        So what?

23
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,429
               It isn't illegal 
              to make horchatas 
                     with milk. 

24
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,597
       Are you sugaring         
        your burrito?           

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,232
          Food is anarchy, dude.

26
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,935
         Live by your own rules.

   Ugh.

          Want some?            

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,407
Keep your sacrilege             
off my taco.                    

30
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,776
                         Mmm.

00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,016
          Whoo! Do I feel alive!

32
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:26,218
             You sure you don't 
                   want a bite? 

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,786
        Definitely sure.        

34
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,621
    Who's up for fireworks?     

35
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,924
  I can't see how that'd be     
         a good idea.           

36
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,592
       'Cause I totally         
    wanna make fireworks.

    tone it down a notch.       

41
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,437

00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,611
What the heck                   
was that?!                      

46
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,713
I thought rainbows              
were made of light.             

47
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,748
                My rainbows are 
           made of stuff, okay? 

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,250
       Okay, okay, okay.        

49
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,818
               You just smashed 
                  a police car. 

50
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,987
           Oh, man.             
 This is fine, this is fine.    

51
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,622
What's the big                  
deal, Marco?                    

52
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,891
I've done this                  
a thousand times.               

53
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,826
I'll just have my dad           
give them some crowns.          

54
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,628
Call it even.                   

55
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,263
              Things don't work 
            like that on Earth. 

56
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,065
         Here, you'll           
        go to prison.           

57
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,167
  - You mean like Saint O's?    
 - It's worse than Saint O's.   

58
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,902
        They give you           
       one bar of soap,         

59
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,770
   and you have to make it      
      last a whole year.        

60
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,607
       You gotta get up         
    every day at 4:00 a.m.      

61
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,642
and make hash browns            
you're not allowed to eat.      

62
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,677
And they force you              
to wear orange jumpsuits        

63
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,714
     - every single day.        
          - Orange?!            

64
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,651
              Ai. I don't know. 
                   You tell me. 

65
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,420
They noticed                    
the dent.                       

66
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,756
                I guess I could 
            visit you in prison 

67
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,358
                    or whatever.

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,593
    There's only one thing      
      left for me to do.        

69
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,829
         I'm gonna run away.    

70
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,264
Wait, wait, wait.               

71
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,466
No, that's not...               
Running is worse.               

72
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,169
             You can't stop me, 
                      rule boy. 

73
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,770
          Star, wait.           

74
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,274
          I'll contact you when 
     I find a place to lay low. 

75
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,779
Look, if you can't read,        
you can't do a crossword.       

76
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,685
             Whoa!!             

77
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,792
              Oh!               

78
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,728
    No one'll find me here.     

79
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,897
   Okay, first day in hiding.   

80
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,732
        Where to start?         

81
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,568
            Shelter.            

82
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,041
    Okay, maybe something       
      less conspicuous.         

83
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,749
       Not too shabby,          
    if I do say so myself.      

84
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,757
          Good enough.          

85
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,627
         ( shivering )          

86
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,935
          ( squawks )           

87
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,338
       ( all squawking )        

88
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,373
   Well, what are you doing     
     down here, sunshine?       

89
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,576
         Uh, nothin'.           
    Just takin' a stroll.       

90
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,578
      ( stomach growling )      

91
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,580
              Well, sounds like 
              someone's hungry. 

92
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,682
              I'm about to make 
                 some pancakes, 

93
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,750
          if you'd like to join.

94
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,019
I do like pancakes.             

95
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,389
     Well, then, my house       
    is right through hair.      

96
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,757
         Wait a second.         

97
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,426
 Did you just say hair?         

98
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,762
        Of course not,          
           my dear.             

99
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,697
        ( bird squawks )        

100
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,602
             Okay. Mm, pancakes.

101
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:36,308
  Welcome to 80 square feet     
 of my own personal paradise.   

102
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,578
        Oh, your home           
         is so cozy.            

103
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,313
      A radical tapestry.       

104
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,415
                 Would you like 
            one pancake or two? 

105
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,816
Five, please.                   

106
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,985
              Wow!              

107
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:50,522
       - Cool loft bed.         
    - Pancakes are ready.       

108
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,727
           So you gonna tell me 
                  what you did? 

109
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,229
       What do you mean?        

110
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,164
               Oh, hon, come on.

111
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,932
          Folks don't come down 
                   to the river 

112
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,968
      unless they broke         
      some of the rules.        

113
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,503
                  Your secret's 
                  safe with me. 

114
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,905
         Well... okay.          

115
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,841
  So, like, I was with Marco    
      at Britta's Tacos,        

116
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,010
     and we were eating,        
    and he was all, like,       

117
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,945
     "Star, you can't put       
   sugar on your burrito."      

118
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,248
    But what does he care,      
           ya know?             

119
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,117
  So then I ate the burrito     
       and I wanted to          
     see some fireworks.        

120
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,820
  Again, he's, like, "Star,     
don't fireworks your burrito,"  

121
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,822
     - and it's all like,       
don't do this, don't do that.   
        - ( humming )           

122
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,259
  Hey. My eyes are down here.   

123
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,928
            Oh. I'm sorry, dear.

124
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,464
               Go on and finish 
                    your story. 

125
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,000
    So anyway, my rainbow       
      smashed a cop car.        

126
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,936
Jumped a fence and fell asleep  
in some garbage by the river,   

127
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,438
       and now I'm here.        

128
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,273
     So... what did you do?     

129
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,041
                   Oh, you know.

130
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,810
                   I steal hair.

131
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,279
   Oh, why would you do that?   

132
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,047
       Oh, no, no, no,          
           sweetie.             

133
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,849
      It's not like that.       

134
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,484
      I don't take hair         
         from people.           

135
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,985
                     No, no, no.

136
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,055
              It's more of like 
    a back-alley kind of thing. 

137
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,358
     You know, dumpsters,       
     behind hair salons,        

138
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,793
                  dog kennels-- 
                discarded hair. 

139
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,796
So you do, like, witchy stuff   
    with the hair, right?       

140
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,132
    Is that what this is?       
   You some kind of witch?      

141
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,534
     Oh, goodness no, dear.     

142
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,070
          You can do            
  lots of things with hair.     

143
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,806
   I wove it into that tapestry 
              you like so much. 

144
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,675
         Stuff your bed with it.

145
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,910
        Heck, you can even make 
        pancake batter from it. 

146
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,980
          ( laughs )            
  I'm just playin' with you.    

147
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,482
        But seriously,          
      my favorite thing         

148
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,751
      to do with the hair       

149
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:30,655
is to weave it into nests for   
all my wounded forest friends.  

150
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,059
              Aww!              

151
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,329
                   You can make 
            anything from hair. 

152
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,098
               Well, anything...

153
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,734
           but love.            

154
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,106
      Star, your family         
          loves you.            

155
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,042
                Let's call them 
     and tell them you're okay. 

156
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,878
No, no, no.                     
You don't have to do that.      

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,713
Just let me stay                
here with you.                  

158
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,382
I can sleep anywhere.           
Look. ( snoring )               

159
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,284
     But this is no life        
      for a little girl.        

160
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,052

161
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,855
       - No, thank you.         
           - Star!

172
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,795
               What is going on?

- WOMAN: Are those footprints?  

230
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,628
       Okay, I surrender.       

231
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,230
Just lock me up                 
and put me in orange.           

232
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,132
Seeing Marco once a month       
is better than never again.     

233
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,568
                          Marco.

234
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,937
         You mean him?          

235
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,141
       Star? You're okay!       

236
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,577
            We were so worried. 
            How'd you find her? 

237
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,046
               We have our ways.

238
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,216
        You know, you shouldn't 
            run away like that. 

239
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,985
      You really worried        
      your friend here.         

240
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,654
 Lucky for you, we were gonna   
smash that old squad car anyway.

241
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,322
     What? We were?             

242
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,825
   At the annual police car     
      demolition derby.         

243
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,461
           I was really looking 
        forward to smashing it. 

244
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,064
Phew! Well, if you              
won't be needing me....         

245
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,266
I'll just see myself out.       

246
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,768
         Just a moment.         

247
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,570
    You're not getting off      
          that easy.            

248
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,006
             Uh...              

249
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,080
        You really can pull off 
               jumpsuit orange. 

250
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,982
         I know, right?         

251
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,951
        But enough of           
      this manual labor.        

252
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,120
        It's magic time.        

253
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,589
          Star, isn't that what 
         got you into this mess 
            in the first place? 

254
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,324
     No, Marco. That was        
     the rainbow glitter,       

255
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,260
unicorn gnome hat, kitty bacon, 
  Hawaiian nightmare spell.     

256
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,396
    Super geyser windstorm!     

257
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,934
        Yeah, that was          
         totally me.            

258
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,404
My bad.                         
Nobody panic.                   
I'll put it back.               

259
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,004
     I'm glad you're open.      

260
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,139
         I'm starving.          

261
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,709
        I'd like some           
      porridge, please.         

262
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,477
       ( snaps fingers )        

263
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,414
                No!             

264
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,156
          This is mud.          

265
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,633
       That's not funny.        

266
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,078
       You messed with          
     the wrong bird, rat.       

267
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,781
    Face-melting death ray!     

268
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,287
              Huh?              

269
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,356
          ( shrieks )           

270
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,429
              Ow!               

271
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,297
           ( growls )           

272
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:52,470
          ( humming )           

273
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,974
Star!                           

274
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,445
It's your turn                  
to take out the garbage.        

275
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,380
     Marco, you've ruined       
     my Mewni battleship.       

276
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,482
Don't you think you have        
enough ships in a bottle?       

277
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,152
       Enough? I don't          
        even know you.          

278
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,088
Come on. We told Mom            
and Dad we'd have               
the place cleaned up            

279
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,324
before they got home,           
and garbage is all yours.       

280
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,293
           Oh, fine!            

281
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,497
    Summoning cloudy charm.     

282
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,466
      Cloudy, could you         
     take out the gar...        

283
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,568
 ( wheezing )                   

284
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,303
Cloudy?                         

285
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,638
          ( wheezing )          

286
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,274
          ( rattles )           

287
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,675
Cloudy?                         

288
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,844
         Oh, hey, Star.         

289
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,646
Uh, are you okay?               

290
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,282
     Yeah. Perfectly fine.      

291
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,918
Okay.                           

292
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,519
Could you take out              
the garbage?                    

293
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,921
           Sure can.            

294
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:46,024
    I guess princess hands      
       are too delicate         

295
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,859
       to touch garbage.        

296
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,527
           - What?              
        - Oh, nothing.          

297
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,632
          Excuse me.            
          Pardon me.            

298
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,434
       I got a mouthful         
         of garbage.            

299
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,773
 I don't know, girls.           

300
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,042
Maybe this isn't                
what it looks like.             

301
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,544
        It looks like           
        a magic wand.           

302
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,479
        What did I say?         

303
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,815
      Follow three feet         
          behind me.            

304
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,717
             Three!             

305
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,653
 Yeah, anyway, I don't know,    
maybe it's just a baby rattle.  

306
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,222
      What are you doing?       

307
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,890
      No. No, put it down.      

308
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,893
      Let go, you nasty,        
         nasty thing.           

309
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:25,396
    You let go of my thing!     

310
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,403
           ( gasps )            

311
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,138
             What?!             

312
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,707
   Do it again.                 

313
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,244
    Not you, you stupid...      
         ( shrieks )            

314
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,982
     I said not you, bird!      

315
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,393
          Do it again.          

316
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,034
              ( evil laughter ) 
           It's working, girls. 

317
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:05,036
     Oh, no, no. No, no!        
        I was kidding.          

318
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,238
      Please, let me go.        
          Let me go!            

319
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,508
Don't let me go!                
( screams )                     

320
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,478
          ( groaning )          

321
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:16,581
Oh, no.                         

322
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,016
 What happened?                 

323
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,118
          ( groaning )          

324
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,287
       I had an accident.       

325
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,621
( loudly ) Glossaryk!           

326
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,424
   - Inside voices, please.     
      - Oh, sorry. Yeah.        

327
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,194
Uh, Glossaryk, there's          
something funky happening       
with my wand.                   

328
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,263
   Oh. What's wrong with it?    

329
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,565
      It's acting weird.        
     It's not doing what        
      it's supposed to.         

330
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:38,102
     Star, maybe there's        
  something wrong with you.     

331
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,871
   You ever think about that?   

332
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,472
     What's that supposed       
           to mean?             

333
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,408
     Uh, I'm not 100% sure.     

334
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,977
       I guess it means         
  there's something wrong...    

335
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,046
         with everyone.         

336
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,314
      I mean, look at me.       

337
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,649
         I did magic            
       on my own face.          

338
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,285
         - You know?            
     - No help as usual.        

339
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,488
      It hurts everywhere!      

340
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,892
  MARCO: Star, you're taking    
 care of the garbage, right?    

341
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,593
  Yeah. I got Cloudy to do it.  

342
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,395
Uh, about that...               

343
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,030
          ( giggling )          

344
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,336
       I don't know why         
 I have so much energy today.   

345
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,538
   Must be all that iced tea.   

346
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,153
          No, girls,            
     it's gonna get ugly.       

347
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,356
       ( mice squeaking )       

348
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,257
        ( Ludo humming )        

349
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,242
        A bowl of your          
       finest mud, sir.         

350
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,280
  Mm, I can taste it already.   

351
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,615
       ( snaps fingers )        

352
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,394
              Ah!               

353
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,731
           All done.            

354
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,703
         Do your worst!         

355
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,744
          ( laughing )          

356
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,479
         Ah! Whoopsie!          

357
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,847
 What's with him?               

358
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,016
    Cloudy, you stop this       
          right now.            

359
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,351
Giddy-up!                       

360
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,620
  - Are you listening to me?    
           - Whee!              

361
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,191
            Stop playing around 
         and clean all this up. 

362
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:44,262
              Uh-oh. Looks like 
             someone's allergic 
                 to good vibes. 

363
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,766
       ( Cloudy laughs )        

364
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,835
     Okay, that's enough.       
     Sunshine friendship.       

365
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,603
         ( mocking )            
     Sunshine friendship.       

366
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,938
            Oopsie.             

367
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,907
     My Mewni battleships!      

368
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,542
          ( growling )          

369
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,444
   Sunshine friendship spell!   

370
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:05,416
   Hey! That was sooooo rude!   

371
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,837
          No, girls.            
          I'm fine.             

372
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,842
       Come on, hit me          
      like you mean it!         

373
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,716
      Now you're really         
   starting to tick me off.     

374
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,335
              Run.              

375
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,152
       ( evil cackling )        

376
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,389
        Cloudy, you're          
       out of control!          

377
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,503
           That's it!           

378
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,005
            Enough!             

379
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,578
        Hey! You poked          
         my fluffies!           

380
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,852
        I think you're          
      making him worse.         

381
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,458
       You gotta stop!          
            Star!               

382
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,360
             Marco!             

383
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,734
    Raspberry ribbon lasso!     

384
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,043
   Sunshine friendship spell!   

385
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,815
        Oh! ( giggles )         

386
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,189
         - You okay?            
    - Yeah, thanks to you.      

387
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,924
( Cloudy giggling )             

388
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,260
       Whoa! What a mess!       

389
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,329
         What happened?         

390
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,531
              Yeah, what was up 
                with your wand? 

391
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:37,034
I have no idea.                 

392
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,605
  Kids, we got you ice cream    
   for cleaning the house.      

393
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,114
    Oh, Star, it is always      
  exciting with you around.     

394
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,717
                This'll take us 
          all weekend to clean. 

395
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,919
               Oh, no, no.      
               I've got this.   

396
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,021
     Tidying up tidal wa...     

397
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,525
                  You know what?

398
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,828
             Give me that thing.

399
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,035
          Oh, that's way better!

400
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,945
             Now...             

401
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,648
     give me some porridge.
