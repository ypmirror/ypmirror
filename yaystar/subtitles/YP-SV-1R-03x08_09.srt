21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,363
                    We're gonna 
                miss you, dude. 

22
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,032
Come on, Marco,                 
can't you stay                  
a little longer?                

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,067
           Love to,             
     but Earth's calling.       

24
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,269
                All right then, 
                      see ya on 
               the flip, Marco. 

25
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,505
             Whoa!!             

26
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,711
Uh, well, I guess               
this is good-bye.               

27
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,147
     And what a pleasure        
          it's been.            

28
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,649
     This place won't be        
the same without you, my lad.   

29
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,284
       But before you go,       

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,719
      there's something         
      I want to give you        

31
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,654
     for all you've done        
       for our kingdom.         

32
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,557
           Squire!              
            Ahem.               

33
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,826
             Ta-da!             

34
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,229
Whoa! Cool.                     

35
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,131
      Ha ha, you're like        
   a real live knight now.      

36
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,832
      Look at you, my boy.      

37
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,901
     In fact, if you ever       
 want to be a knight one day,   

38
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,669
        give me a call.         

39
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,271
Wow, thanks,                    
River.                          

40
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,274
          Take care of yourself 
                 back on Earth. 

41
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,043
       Thanks.                  

42
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,815
I guess this is it.             

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,851
                 Well, bye.     

44
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,957
                    Wait, Marco.

45
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,592
I need a longer                 
good-bye than that.             

46
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,528
                    Me, too.    

47
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,505
 Well, bye.                     

48
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,140
       Again.                   

49
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,441
                        Bye.    

50
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,644
What... oh, you're              
going to the portal.            

51
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,012
 That's this way.               

52
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,580
           - Uh...              
           - Oh...              

53
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,723
     ( nervous chuckling )      

54
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,025
 Well, bye.                     

55
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,992
                   Bye.         

56
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,160
 Bye.                           

57
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,663
        - Okay, Marco.          
           - Right.             

58
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,668
Oh, and can you let me know     
if you see my hoodie anywhere?  

59
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,636
                     I told you 
             I haven't seen it, 

60
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,972
              but if I find it, 
         I will send it to you. 

61
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,740
Okay, cool.                     

62
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,809
Thanks. Okay.                   

63
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,411
 Bye.                           

64
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,181
I'm... going                    
to my room.                     

65
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,584
               But sweetie pie, 
          your room's this way. 

66
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,120
   Uh, yeah, it's wherever      
    I want it to be, Dad.       

67
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,257
       Sparkle glitter          
         bomb expand.           

68
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,767
           ( sighs )            

69
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,249
       ( sniffs deeply )        

70
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,451
          ( coughs )            
        Gross, Marco.           

71
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,052
     Smells like that time      

72
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,188
 we went on that dimensional    
      school field trip!        

73
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,056
           ( sniffs )           

74
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,092
       Ugh. Gonna vomit.        

75
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,027
 And that smells like the one   
   time we got Chinese food     

76
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,863
   after the double feature     
        karate movie!           

77
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,231
        ( coughs, gags )        

78
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,799
 And that smells like the time  

79
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,802
       we tried to save         
      the bounce lounge.        

80
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,971
         - Hey, girl!           
         - Pony Head!           

81
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,773
I heard what went down          
in your kingdom,                

82
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,875
and so I rushed                 
right over as soon              
as my hair was done.            

83
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,144
You know I need                 
to do that. Wait.               

84
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,712
Are you hiding                  
something from me?              

85
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,648
        No. This is me.         

86
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,716
         Totes normal.          

87
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,752
      You better not be         
   keeping secrets from me.     

88
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,888
         Okay, fine.            
  It's Marco's hoodie, okay?    

89
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,290
       Are you happy now?       

90
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,325
 Oooh!!                         

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,761
Darn it, that thing             
smells like feet.               

92
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,096
    I know, but it smells       
         like Marco.            

93
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,432
  I know I should return it,    
    but I really miss him,      

94
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,934
   and it's the only thing...   

95
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,836
         What the...            
   hey, what are you doing?     

96
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,838
I'm washing                     
this stinky thing.              

97
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,507
                    No!         

98
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,679
Hey, girl, you need             
to get a grip.                  

99
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,746
                       No.      

100
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,014
      Where are you going?      

101
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,316
             To get that hoodie.

102
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,792
           Yes? Ah,             
     Princess Butterfly.        

103
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,793
Hi, Lavabo.                     

104
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,695
       I must apologize         
     for your blue dress.       

105
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,030
     It will not be ready       
        till Tuesday.           

106
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,465
I don't care.                   
I'm looking for                 
a red hoodie.                   

107
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,534
                      A hoodie? 
                  Date and time 
            you dropped it off. 

108
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,203
Just now,                       
but it was a total accident.    

109
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,772
It's perfectly clean.           
I just need it back             
before it gets washed.          

110
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,141
       A clean hoodie?          
        Not to worry.           

111
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,210
                       You need 
            the pick-up window. 

112
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,012
                     Welcome to 
            the pick-up window. 

113
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,814
                   How may I be 
                 of assistance? 

114
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,315
          Red hoodie.           

115
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,217
           - Size?              
       - Medium maybe.          

116
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,952
          Chain mail            
       or metal plate?          

117
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,554
           Cotton.              
        It's a hoodie.          

118
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,825
       - Thread count?          
       - I don't know.          
        I don't count.          

119
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,860
         There it is,           
      right behind you.         

120
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,895
                  Double stitch 
                     or single? 

121
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,397
 It's right behind you.         

122
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,965
                 That should be 
            enough information. 

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,402
    I'll file this and get      
 back to you within 48 hours.   

124
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,970
             What?!             

125
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,739
     ( frustrated groan )       
   This is all your fault.      

126
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,307
You're gonna thank              
me later,                       

127
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,808
once you come                   
to your senses.                 

128
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,510
       I am to my senses.       

129
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,712
              Good news. I have 
           located your hoodie. 

130
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,082
 Unfortunately, it's filthy,    
and must be washed immediately. 

131
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,717
     What? No, no, no, no.      

132
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,819
    I told you, it doesn't      
      need to be washed.        

133
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,321
     Don't bother yourself.     

134
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,156
           I'm sorry, princess, 
      but I must bother myself. 

135
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,758
                  It is my duty.

136
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,560
     I will never forget        
 the moment, as a young boy,    

137
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,764
      and I saw my papi         
   meticulously making sure     

138
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,033
   the royals' linen stayed     
     pure, noble, clean,        

139
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,169
         - and fresh!           
           - Uh...              

140
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,771
  And I swore at that very day  

141
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,507
    that I would never let      
    a garment go unwashed,      

142
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,276
 and I have kept that promise   
      for over 40 years.        

143
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,512
  Therefore, I will make it     
      my utmost priority        

144
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,915
  that this extremely soiled    
      hoodie be washed!         

145
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,586
       Okay, well, that         
       is unfortunate,          

146
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,022
but now, let me                 
tell you about                  
this club I went to.            

147
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,924
        Glitter whale           
        battering ram!          

148
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,928
Girl, what are                  
you doing?                      

149
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,564
                  Trying to get 
                 my hoodie back 
       before Lavabo washes it. 

150
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,933
Are you for real                
right now?                      

151
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,069
  Piled river panda explosion!  

152
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,807
    Through muddled scent       
   and stained shirt piles,     

153
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,377
the dirt of yesterday shall not 
  be the enemy of tomorrow.     

154
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,878
   By the order of the Wash,    

155
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,281
      this is my promise        
     to my true kingdom.        

156
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,917
           Seriously?           

157
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,718
You know,                       
I'm surprised to say it,        

158
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,421
      - but personally,         
   I really do admire this.     
         - Seriously?           

159
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,324
 Star, just let this old dad    
         do his job.            

160
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,293
                    Yes, I must 
                follow my duty. 

161
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,595
            Order and rules are 
         always to be followed, 
                  without fail. 

162
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,330
Okay, calm down though.         

163
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,932
           Everyone must always 
               follow the rules 

164
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,100
                  all the time, 
               always, forever. 

165
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:20,071
What? Okay, did you just        
tell my friend what to          
do forever?                     

166
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,073
     We are getting back        
 your weird red stink hoodie.   

167
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,842
     - We're getting it.        
     - Wait, wait, wait.        

168
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,443
      - Two seconds ago,        
       you were like--          
  - I'm aware of my actions,    

169
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,079
     and I'm so sorry for       
 not always having your back,   

170
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,948
      and I hope we can move on 
      and grow as the beautiful 
             princesses we are. 

171
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,450
          I must uphold my oath.

172
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,553
No, no, no.                     
He can't wash the hoodie!       

173
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,155
          Get back here, Lavabo.

174
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,925
            - Oh!               
    - Can't see anything!       

175
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,261
                        I know. 
                Let's split up. 

176
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,930
       MARCO: <i> Good-bye</i>         
       <i> forever, Star.</i>          

177
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,865
No, no, no, no.                 

178
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,633
No! Don't go!                   

179
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,035
I won't let you go.             

180
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,571
                Ay!             

181
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,273
Lavabo!                         

182
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,041
         No. Give me            
         that hoodie!           

183
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,943
Your Highness, I can't          
stress enough how badly         

184
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,812
I am not                        
going to do that.               

185
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,484
   Huppa!                       

186
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,556
        Kitten Pegasus          
        battle barrel!          

187
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,761
       Stop! You're not         
     washing that hoodie!       

188
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,698
         Just give up.          

189
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,535
 As long as this body of mine   
    is capable of moving,       

190
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,837
     I shall always move        
       towards my duty.         

191
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,542
  Shimmer soap tentacle wave!   

192
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,220
You're not moving towards       
anything anymore.               

193
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,022
This is                         
your last chance.               

194
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:48,159
    My entire life I have       
dedicated to my knight's oath.  

195
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,228
         This is something that 
      cannot be bent or broken. 

196
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,530
        My brothers and sisters 
                taught me that. 

197
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,566
          I cherish the moments 
               we had together, 

198
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,167
             and hold onto them 
                     every day. 

199
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,602
        It has made me who I am,

200
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,737
              and soon, I shall 
                see them again. 

201
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,339
          Wait, what?           

202
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,775
You thought I was               
gonna kill you over a hoodie?   

203
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,944
            Is that not what is 
                 going on here? 

204
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,447
No. I was gonna maybe           
turn you into a duck,           

205
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,783
or, like, boop you              
on the nose real hard.          

206
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,085
        But your eyes,          
   they had the blood lust.     

207
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,854
That's just 'cause...           

208
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,456
 Pony Head was right.           

209
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,225
I really am messed up           
about Marco.                    

210
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,796
   I mean, I spent all day      
    chasing down a knight       

211
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,065
      who was just doing        
        his weird job.          

212
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,601
  All because I thought that    
if I didn't have Marco's hoodie,

213
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,036
       I wouldn't have          
    any piece of him left,      

214
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,372
     which just isn't true.     

215
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,141
   I'll always have Marco.      
   We'll always be friends.     

216
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,112
     - ( water splashes )       
 - Whoa, what are you doing?    

217
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,416
         - ( sighs )            
       - Do not worry.          

218
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,452
                    I put it on 
                a gentle cycle. 

219
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:54,259
       ( sniffs deeply )        

220
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,063
          Miladies, the garment 
                      is clean, 

221
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,266
        and up to the standards 
    of the Knights of the Wash. 

222
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,236
( sniffs ) Oh, wow.             
Now that is delightful.         

223
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,339
     Star, you should...        
           Awww...              

224
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,475
             Aw, don't be pouty.

225
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,176
          Eh.                   

226
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,245
                 Come over here.

227
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,147
                 Milady, please.

228
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,017
           ( sniffs )           

229
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,586
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!       

230
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,188
       It still stinks          
         like Marco!            

231
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,024
            What?!              
       No, it does not.         

232
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,026
      I just sniffed it.        
     Tell her it doesn't.       

233
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,094
        The hoodie is,          
       in fact, clean.          

234
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,797
      What you are experiencing 
      is the memory of a scent. 

235
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,866
 You don't need to hold on to   
   stinky hoodies any more,     

236
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,367
                   you know why?

237
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,169
                  'Cause, like, 
           what we have learned 

238
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,038
                        is that 
             Earth Turd's scent 

239
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,140
          is like in your heart 
                   or whatever. 

240
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,808
 Thanks, Pony Head.             

241
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,843
          ( laughs )            
      You got it, girl.         

242
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,982
        ( sighs loudly )        

243
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,917
 ( doorbell rings )             

244
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,887
                 Hello?         

245
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,722
           ( meows )            

246
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,826
           ( gasps )            

247
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,095
          All right!            
          My hoodie!            

248
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,299
           ( sniffs )           

249
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,568
      Hey, kinda smells         
          like Star.            

250
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,648
       ( River laughing )       

251
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,551
And then,                       
Lekmet said,                    

252
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,653
( guttural bleating )           

253
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,689
          ( laughter )          

254
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,159
       Hors d'oeuvres,          
        Your Highness?          

255
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,394
 Uh, why not?                   

256
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,737
       It's not exactly         
        princess food,          

257
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,106
     but it was Lekmet's        
        favorite meal.          

258
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,274
      That's how humble         
        that guy was.           

259
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,244
          To Lekmet!            
    Our selfless comrade,       

260
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,346
   who always gave to others    

261
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,082
      before ever taking        
         for himself.           

262
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,283
          ( bleating )          

263
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,119
        ( all bleating )        

264
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,122
    I told him that would       
   get him killed one day.      

265
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,624
       Give the can to          
      your father, love.        

266
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,259
        He's got teeth          
      like a tiger fish.        

267
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,039
   Glossaryck! Glossaryck,      
      wait. Glossaryck!         

268
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,776
                       Oh, uh...

269
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,311
        Hey, Star's upside down 
             in the punch bowl. 

270
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,613
         Oh, not again.         

271
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,615
  ( bubbling )                  

272
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,416
                     Star!      

273
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,918
Glossaryck!                     
Mom, did you see him?           

274
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,052
He was in the bowl,             
in that bowl.                   

275
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,621
You all saw him,                
right?                          

276
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,590
           Star, I know this is 
              an emotional day, 

277
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,760
           but this is Lekmet's 
     funeral, not Glossaryck's. 

278
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,297
Mom, I saw                      
Glossaryck.                     

279
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,599
                   Star, we all 
              see Glossaryck... 

280
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,802
                 here, and here.

281
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,603
And in                          
that punch bowl.                

282
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,272
All bug-eyed                    
and big-mouthed.                

283
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,007
Classic Glossaryck.             

284
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,742
I bet he came                   
for the memorial.               

285
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,744
     Look, I get it, Star.      

286
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,512
    Funerals are unsettling.    

287
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,215
        Strange food,           
      Lekmet's friends.         

288
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,285
 Music.                         

289
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,258
It's all different,             

290
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,660
   and maybe a little scary.    

291
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,929
     But don't turn this        
     into a ghost story.        

292
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,598
   What? Who said anything      
        about a ghost?          

293
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,366
     I saw Glossaryck, Mom.     

294
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,302
   You didn't see Glossaryck,   

295
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,437
        and you didn't          
        see his ghost.          

296
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,806
   Okay, stop saying ghost.     
         It's weird.            

297
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,675
                  Glossaryck is 
                      gone now. 

298
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,610
        You just have           
        to let him go.          

299
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,212
( sighs )                       

300
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,647
           You know, when I was 
                 a little girl, 

301
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,850
        and there was something 
             I couldn't let go, 

302
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,384
            my mother taught me 
                        to say, 

303
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,486
         "Balloobalee           
         balloobalo,            

304
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,223
        I let you go,           
        I let you go!"          

305
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,225
         And I always           
   felt better afterwards.      

306
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,293
            Give it a try, dear.

307
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,396
        What?                   

308
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,071
          ( screams )           

309
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,473
         ( stammering )         

310
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,509
          Glossaryck!           

311
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,919
   Balloobalee, balloobalo,     
 I let you go, I let you go!    

312
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,754
         I let you go!!         

313
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,465
     Why didn't that work?      

314
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,438
                ( ringing )     

315
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,840
     - ( chewing loudly )       
           - Janna!             

316
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,444
       ( Star speaking          
        indistinctly )          

317
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,546
   You're seeing dead people?   

318
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,115
   That's the coolest thing     
    I've heard all summer.      

319
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,850
          No, Janna,            
    weren't you listening?      

320
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,285
         Not people.            
         Glossaryck.            

321
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,453
      I am being haunted        
    by Glossaryck's ghost.      

322
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,955
  I did my mom's balloobalee    
balloobalo, but it didn't work! 

323
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,457
         - Baba what?           
 - Janna, I need your weird,    

324
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,459
    dark-sided expertise,       
     or I'm telling you,        

325
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,961
      there are gonna be        
    two ghosts up in here!      

326
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,696
         Okay, well...          

327
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,464
     - you're definitely        
        being haunted.          
            - <i> No!</i>              

328
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,099
             Yeah.              

329
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,302
   <i> If you're the only one</i>      
        <i> who sees him,</i>          

330
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,137
  <i> it might mean he has some</i>    
<i>unfinished business with you.</i>   

331
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,239
  Okay, can you stop eating     
       for one second?          

332
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,707
          Also, what            
     unfinished business?       

333
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,475
     - ( Janna chewing )        
           - Janna!             

334
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,377
  <i> Sorry, it was getting cold.</i>  

335
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,379
   <i> Maybe there's an anchor</i>     
          <i> near you.</i>            

336
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,315
      <i> Something he left</i>        
       <i> in this world,</i>          

337
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,550
      <i> keeping his ghost</i>        
        <i> bound to it.</i>           

338
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,252
       <i> Are any of his</i>          
     <i> belongings around?</i>        

339
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,820
    No. Glossaryck didn't       
        own anything.           

340
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,222
 The only thing that sort of    
    belonged to him was...      

341
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,457
           ( gasps )            

342
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,330
       JANA: <i> Yo, Star,</i>         
        <i> are you dead?</i>          

343
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,501
         It's the book.         

344
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,003
      I kept the remains        
      of the spell book         

345
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,571
        they found in           
     the monster temple.        

346
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,440
    <i> Why would you keep that?</i>   

347
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,609
  Jana, you're gonna get on     
my case for keeping weird stuff?

348
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,347
Touché. It says here you gotta  
      let that stuff go,        

349
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,916
     <i> and by letting go,</i>        
       <i> I mean bury it.</i>         

350
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,017
           Bury bury?           

351
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,154
       Yeah, and deep.          
          Real deep.            

352
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,370
    Okay, okay, calm down.      
        I'm doing it.           

353
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,274
       And buried buried.       

354
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,509
     Good-bye, Glossaryck.      

355
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,215
             Whew!              

356
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,430
         No Glossaryck.         

357
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,107
       Oh, no Glossaryck.       

358
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,085
       ( thudding noise )       

359
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,922
             What?!             

360
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,359
  Oh, Janna, you did not say    
      this would happen.        

361
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,128
           Oh, gross.           

362
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,663
           ( yells )            

363
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,433
        ( shuddering )          
            What?               

364
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,306
          Glossaryck!           

365
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,110
   Why does he have to have     
       so many fingers?         

366
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,491
                 Leave me alone!

367
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,895
  Janna, Janna, Janna, Janna.   

368
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,564
         <i> - Yo, Star.</i>           
           - Janna!             

369
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,568
       ( Star babbling          
        indistinctly )          

370
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,603
        You buried it           
      in a pet cemetery?        

371
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,371
       Well, he's small.        

372
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,140
      <i> Did you want him</i>         
     <i> to haunt you more?</i>        

373
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,576
      It was better than        
flushing him down the toilet.   

374
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,111
       <i> That's not how</i>          
       <i> it works, Star.</i>         

375
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,646
Yeah, I can see that now, Janna.
       He's still here.         

376
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,482
       Now he's, like,          
          here here.            

377
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,654
   Wait, you're seeing him      
    in the physical world?      

378
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,323
      Oh, that's not good.      

379
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,159
     You need to go bury        
the pieces in a sacred place.   

380
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,994
  <i> Somewhere that would have</i>    
    <i> significance to him.</i>       

381
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,963
      <i> Then you'll stop</i>         
         <i> seeing him.</i>           

382
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,132
      And it looks like         
  you gotta do it right now,    

383
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,600
        or else, he'll          
   haunt you for eternity.      

384
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,502
        I think I have          
      the perfect place.        

385
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,003
  Okay, thanks so much, Janna.  

386
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,739
            Bye-ee!             

387
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,142
         - Ugh, loud.           
    - MARCO: Who was that?      

388
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,010
 No one. Shut up.               

389
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,713
        Why do we even          
     hang out with Janna?       

390
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,546
     Why, Glossaryck, why       
     are you still here?        

391
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,714
          I gave you            
       what you wanted.         

392
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,650
    What else do you want       
           from me?             

393
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,518
      ( frustrated groan )      

394
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,687
        You are always          
       so frustrating,          

395
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,023
        and confusing,          
       and Glossaryck!          

396
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,692
   Okay, look, I know I was     
   a jerk to you sometimes,     

397
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,062
    okay, but you're being      
   an even bigger jerk now.     

398
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,298
    I'm sorry, I'm sorry.       
    Is that what you want?      

399
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,734
   I thought you were gone,     
           but no.              

400
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,336
          No, no, no.           

401
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,372
       Now you're just          
spooky, bug-eyed reflections.   

402
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,841
         And a cloud?           
       Who is a cloud?          

403
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,077
      Under weird things        
         in my room.            

404
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,579
      I just don't get it.      

405
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,081
  I thought you didn't even     
    want to be around me.       

406
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,418
    You know, Glossaryck,       
     I have so much to do       

407
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,253
     to fix this kingdom,       
       and it would be          

408
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,689
      a lot more helpful        
   if you were really here      

409
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,224
  instead of just haunting me,  

410
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,427
      like some kind of         
   weird reflection creep!      

411
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,065
           ( sighs )            

412
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,069
     You know, Glossaryck,      

413
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,371
    you never made it easy      
      learning from you.        

414
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,674
   Maybe that was the point.    

415
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,677
  You did always trust me to    
 figure things out on my own.   

416
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,614
  And you were still always     
        there for me,           

417
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:20,251
  and no one else was really    
     always there for me.       

418
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:24,622
     Teacher...friend...        
       weird book guy.          

419
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,692
 Whatever you were, you were    
    super important to me.      

420
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,194
     Thank you, Glossaryck.     

421
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,763
          Thank you             
       for everything.          

422
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,473
       I hope you find          
  your big bowl of pudding.     

423
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,743
    Balloobalee, balloobalo.    

424
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:49,013
        I let you go,           
        I let you go.           

425
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,652
       ( loud rumbling )        

426
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,191
            Oh, no.             

427
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,098
          ( gasping )           

428
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,738
                         Do you 
                hear something? 

429
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,840
           Mom, Dad!            

430
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,842
     Star, I'm not going        
      to tell you again.        

431
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,444
             Stop kicking doors.

432
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,913
Mom, oh, my goodness.           
You won't believe it.           

433
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,682
I was in the sanctuary,         
and I was saying good-bye,      

434
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,817
and I really said good-bye,     
and then, all this magic        
shot out of the well--          

435
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,819
           Slow down, slow down.

436
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,255
              What in the world 
         are you talking about? 

437
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,756
 I did what you said.           

438
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,825
I did it,                       
I let him go.                   

439
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,094
I did your balloobalee,         
but...he came back.
