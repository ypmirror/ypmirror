     Now, let me tell you       
          the story             

35
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,066
    of the first Stump Day.     

36
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,936
        Centuries ago,          
  a small band of explorers     

37
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,405
     crashed their ships        
          on Mewni.             

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,241
   After weeks of traveling,    

39
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,443
     they began to get on       
     each other's nerves.       

40
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,744
 Aah! Oh, no.                   

41
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,813
      They planned to go        
     their separate ways,       

42
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,849
        but suddenly,           
      a blizzard struck.        

43
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,252
           Blizzard!            

44
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,188
   And the crew was forced      
to survive by huddling together 

45
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,792
  around a giant tree stump     
to keep warm and share supplies.

46
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,929
         They forged            
   a lasting bond that day,     

47
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,999
      and decided not to        
     split up after all.        

48
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,201
  To commemorate the occasion,  

49
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,537
  they carved their initials    
  on the back of the stump,     

50
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:22,107
   and the kingdom of Mewni     
          was born!             

51
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,876
   That is why, each year,      
       we come together         

52
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,013
     and honor the Stump        
   through our friendships      

53
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,682
      for a full 24 hours.

    to throw Star a party.

                 We did it.     

238
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,281
     The Stump spared us        
 'cause we all came together.   

239
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,952
No, Marco, it left              
'cause it's midnight,           
and Stump Day is over.          

240
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,354
     - It was definitely        
        gonna kill us.          
            - Oh.               

241
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,991
   Thank you, great Stump,      
      wherever you are.         

242
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,193
                Um, why are you 
                   thanking it? 

243
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,529
                  You just said 
          it wanted to kill us. 

244
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,864
Oh, I know.                     

245
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,365
    But it also reminded us     

246
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,167
        just how much           
    we mean to each other,      

247
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,869
       even in the face         
      of certain death.         

248
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,773
In a way, this has been         
the best Stump Day of all,      

249
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,375
though it will be               
very expensive                  

250
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,011
to repair the damage            
to the castle.                  

251
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,381
And we'll have to have an extra 
  big celebration next year,    

252
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,384
 just to make sure things are   
cool between us and the Stump.

Hey, Marco.                     
I just wanted to say            

255
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,191
thank you for planning          
this party for me.

257

even if the timing              
wasn't that great.

you talking about?

eat the beans.

   and he's one of us now.

Spy Eye is definitely

    the twig on the stump?      

352
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,835
