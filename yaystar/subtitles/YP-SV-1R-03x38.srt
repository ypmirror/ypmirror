249
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,073
No! I really did kiss Star!     

250
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,543
    Oh. Well, it's too late now.

251
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,745
     Let's try that again.

      I have thousands          
      of spirits in here!       

255
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,152
         Wha-- [gasps]          

256
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,121

Huh? She's--                    
She's getting bigger!

            Turdina!            

272
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,162
   What are you doing in bed?   

273
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,132
    You're supposed to be       
    looking for your mother.    

274
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:38,202
Oh, Papa, I had                 
the most wonderful dream.       

275
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,705
There were unicorns             
with too many legs              

276
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,208
and marshmallows and Mom.

          You found your mother!

279
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,513
                   Where is she?

280
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,614
                I don't see her.

281
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,948
          [sighs] No.

00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,784
    I mean-- I mean, I did.     
    I did.                      

283
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,318
       But she was there.       

284
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,953
       She was standing         
       right next to me,        

285
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,321
    and I let her get away.     

286
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,023
                It's okay, dear.

287
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,658
         We'll just keep looking
         until we find her.

00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,128
   Then it has come to this!

I tried, Star.                  

298
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,081
                  What happened?

299
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,417
                  Where's Marco?

  Star, she's right behind us.

00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,103
What do we do?                  

306
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,437
         Wait a minute.

Uh... Meteora?

       all balloonified.

00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,092
    Obviously, I can't bring    
    the whole kingdom here,     

319
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,560
