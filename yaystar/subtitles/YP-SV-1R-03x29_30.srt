00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,345
             Truth!             

123
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,747
[scoffs] Whatever.              

124
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,082
 Have you guys even             
read her chapter?               

125
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,085
  Hekapoo, the second question  
          goes to you.          

126
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,488
              Box, pull up      
              the royal archives
              for me, would ya? 

127
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,224
           Exhibit B.           

128
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,193
   Did you abandon your husband,
   King Shastakan,              

129
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,596
        and your kingdom        
        to elope with a monster?

130
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,765
Oh, hello, sweetie.             

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,401
Yes, I did run off              
with a monster.                 

132
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,503
But could you                   
really blame me?                

133
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,605
How could I resist              
a smile like that?              

134
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,440
          Truth again!          

135
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,375
Aww! Huh?                       

136
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,278
           - Uh-huh.            
      - Come on, Eclipsa.       

137
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,114
    - Rhombulus, the third--    
  - Did you eat those babies?!  

138
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,116
             What?              

139
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:29,287
                Ugh! Bobipsa was
                the baby-eater, 
                not Eclipsa!    

140
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,523
Oh, right.                      
I wanna take                    
my question back.               

141
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,527
         There are no take-backs
         in trial by Box!       

142
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,694
        [babies crying]         

143
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,597
Well, I hate                    
to disappoint you,              

144
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,567
but I'm afraid                  
I have not eaten                
even a single baby.             

145
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,736
Now, I did hurt                 
the occasional teenager,        

146
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,639
but only psychologically,       
and they always deserved it.    

147
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,408
We're on a roll here,           
       people!                  

148
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,244
What is wrong--                 
didn't you hear her?            

149
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,313
She didn't eat those babies!    

150
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,581
        Star, sit down.         

151
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,417
        We must respect         
     the rules of the Box.      

152
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,486
             Fine!              

153
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,389
           Eclipsa...           

154
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,624
         Are you sorry          
     for what you've done?      

155
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,461
          No, I'm not.          

156
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,463
            - What?!            
    - The nerve! Outrageous!    

157
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,232
        That settles it.        

158
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,800
    Rhombulus, if you would.    

159
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,137
            - Right.            
         - One moment.          

160
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,572
  I haven't asked my question.  

161
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,474
          Wait. What?           

162
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,776
           - [laughs]           
 - She can't ask us a question. 

163
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,744
             Um...              
  [singsong] I think she can!   

164
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,447
    Right, mom? My mom said!    
     She said in the rules!     

165
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,617
Technically since Eclipsa       
was once a queen of Mewni,      

166
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,587
     she is still a member      
of the Magical High Commission, 

167
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,490
        and every member        
   gets to ask one question.    

168
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,258
        [clears throat]         

169
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,428
        What did you do         
       with my daughter?        

170
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,129
           [all gasp]           

171
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,465
       Uh, I have no idea       
       what she's talking about.

172
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,334
     We didn't do anything      
      with your daughter!       

173
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,803
And honestly?                   
I-I'm kind of offended.         

174
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,605
        Too bad for you.        

175
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,208
          [bellowing]           
        Everyone lied!!         

176
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,376
           - [gasps]            
           - [yelps]            

177
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,715
       What's happening?        
       We told the truth!       

178
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,217
             [Box]              
    Are you sure about that?    

179
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,619
           [all gasp]           

180
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,655
        Uh, c'mon, guys,        
          spit it out!          

181
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,790
    We didn't do anything wrong!

182
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,393
The Box seems to differ!        

183
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,161
  We aren't the ones on trial!  

184
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,398
      If you'd rather get       
      to the truth more quickly,

185
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,733
     I can work with that.      

186
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,401
          - [rumbling]          
          - [all gasp]          

187
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,169
        That's not good.        

188
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,538
             Guys!              

189
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,576
            [grunts]            
  My magic's no good in here!   

190
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,379
            [grunts]            

191
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,813
[grunting]                      

192
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,216
Moon, please shut it off!       

193
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,685
        I can't do that.        
     We all took the oath!      

194
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,625
    Oh, no. Okay, I'm done!     
          I want out!           

195
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,395
    We're gonna be crushed!     

196
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,264
  You know, this is so unfair!  

197
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,334
 You enforce the laws of magic  
    on everyone around you.     

198
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,504
    And yet for some reason,    
       you can lie to us?       

199
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,205
     How does that make you     
         any different          

200
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,375
    than the villain you say    
          Eclipsa is?           

201
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,511
         We got rid of          
     your daughter, sorry!      

202
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,612
             Truth!             

203
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,716
[groans]                        

204
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,551
                  What the heck,
                  Rhombulus?!   

205
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,220
I'm sorry, I'm tired            
of keeping it a secret.         

206
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,422
Tell 'em Omni.                  

207
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,723
         [sighs] Fine.          

208
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,726
   Eclipsa, your ex-husband,    
        King Shastakan,         

209
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,863
    he wanted nothing to do     
with your half-monster daughter.

210
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,900
     So we swapped her out      
      with a peasant girl.      

211
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,402
          We gave her           
     the Royal Magic Wand,      

212
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,906
         and she became         
    the next Queen of Mewni.    

213
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:40,478
 Eclipsa has been found guilty  
  of crimes against Mewmanity.  

214
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,814
However,                        
the Magical High Commission     

215
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,249
has also been found guilty      

216
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,318
of tampering                    
with Mewni's history            

217
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,786
and omitting the truth          

218
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,989
       from the Butterfly family
       for generations.         

219
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,458
   This concludes the trial.    

220
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,960
       Although if we're        
     all being honest here,     

221
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,763
 it seems like y'all still have 
   some issues to deal with.    

222
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,569
         So it was just         
        as we suspected.        

223
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,737
         [both] What?!          

224
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,839
                       Uh, Moon?

225
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,342
               We knew there was
               something missing

226
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,910
      from our family's history.

227
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,413
         Eclipsa's daughter     
         should be recorded here

228
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,949
          in the royal archives,
          but she's gone.       

229
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,686
[gasps] Wait a minute.          
This whole trial was a set-up?! 

230
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,588
     [panicked whimpering]      

231
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,356
          You were planning this
          all along!            

232
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,493
Actually,                       
we all planned this.            

233
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,261
     [panicked whimpering]      

234
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,996
         We thought you might be
         hiding something.      

235
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,998
         And it turns out       
         we were right.         

236
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,934
     You lied to our family     
        for generations.        

237
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,771
 [carriage-return bell dinging] 

238
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,872
                      We had to.

239
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,940
        Can you imagine         
     if the power of Magic      

240
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,942
      fell into the hands       
         of a monster?          

241
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,678
     You let us live a lie.     

242
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,546
    We shouldn't even have      
          the throne.           

243
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,315
   Eclipsa isn't even-- wait.   

244
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:56,387
           You aren't actually  
           my great-great-great-

245
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,790
        great-something-grandma.

246
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,693
     No, sweetie, I'm not.      

247
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,529
     Then... that means...      

248
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,864
      we're no more royal       
      than anybody else.        

249
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,067
        You're still a princess,
        Star.                   

250
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,703
No, Mom. We're nobody.          

251
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,516
               Star! Star, wait!

252
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,225
           [panting]            

253
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,362
    Okay, Trot-Fudge Sundae!    
     You got this! [wails]      

254
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,032
         [both panting]         

255
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,704
          Here you go.          

256
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,443
       [grumbles, grunts]       

257
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,746
           [grumbles]           

258
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,915
    Junk... junk... junk...     

259
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,017
Mm, what's in here?             

260
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,788
Ugh! The worst junk.            

261
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,491
        When will they stop     
        sending us that garbage?

262
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,866
  Huh, Ludo shirt, Ludo mask,   
Ludo mask, Ludo mask, Ludo mask.

263
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,167
            [groans]            

264
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,108
            [gasps]             
     Dimensional scissors?      

265
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,784
        All right, Ludo,        
         where are you?         

266
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,285
           Oh! Blue!            

267
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,421
    Let's see, what's blue?     

268
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,791
        Please don't be         
    the cat-face dimension.     

269
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:44,228
          Wait, green?          
          Okay, green.          

270
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,097
           No, pink.            

271
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,899
         Okay, that's--         

272
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,401
          Blue again?           
        What's going on?        

273
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,704
             Uh-oh.             
    Oh, no, no, no, no, no.     

274
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,108
           [coughing]           

275
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:01,078
        Dennis!                 
        What's going on up here?

276
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,447
           - Nothing.           
      - Well, that nothing      

277
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,650
                interrupted me  
                and my stickers!

278
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:10,021
      [inhales] Mmm.            
      Good old scratch n' sniff.

279
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:14,492
                    What's this?
                    [groaning]  

280
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,262
            Honey!              
            He's doing it again!

281
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,766
             Dennis, do you know
             what a deadbeat is?

282
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,334
                       It's you!

283
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,702
                 That's what    
                 you're gonna be

284
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,205
              if you keep acting
              like your brother,

285
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,708
    collecting all this garbage,
    destroying property,        

286
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,444
         acting like            
         you're too good for us!

287
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,447
     Oh! Are we berating Dennis?
     It's not even dinnertime!  

288
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,016
He's hoarding                   
Ludo stuff again.               

289
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,353
          Dennis, how could you?
          Ludo betrayed us.     

290
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,388
           He and his goons     
           took over the castle.

291
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,023
               He was the worst.

292
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,458
You're the worst.               

293
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,560
       You got something to say?

294
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,728
No.                             

295
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,530
                        No what?

296
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,332
No, sir.                        

297
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,067
          That's what I thought.

298
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,369
Now clean up this mess          
and come help me                

299
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,137
and your mother                 
with our stickers.              

300
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,505
            And mind your nails.

301
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,709
             We need those fresh
             young fingers.     

302
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,689
 [sighs] No, you guys, you need 
   to get back in the closet.   

303
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,425
  My dad catches you out here,  
      here's gonna freak.       

304
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:27,398
Spider, these things are useless
   unless I know where he is.   

305
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:33,070
                What? Y-you just
                want me to...   

306
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,939
                        Okay.   

307
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,708
Be my guest.                    

308
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,113
[squawks softly]                

309
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:50,722
  I-I told you they don't work  
 if you don't know where he is. 

310
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,158
         [sighs] Okay.          

311
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,234
                       [squeals]

312
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,609
       [groans] Come on!        
          Stay awake!           

313
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,645
          What is it?           

314
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,415
     [gasps] You found him!     

315
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,421
     Let's get my brother.      

316
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,492
            [yelps]             

317
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,230
         Our... house?          

318
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,766
        made of garbage.        

319
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,601
        [whistling tune,        
         water running]         

320
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,370
             Ludo?              

321
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,808
      Wha-a-a-t?! Spider!       

322
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,911
      [laughs] That's you!      
         Oh, my friend!         

323
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,246
   Brother, it's me, Dennis.    

324
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,116
            Dennis?             
     How long has it been?      

325
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,819
      Last time I saw you,      
      you were this tall,       

326
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,588
     and now you're exactly     
        as tall as I am!        

327
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,990
    What are you doing here?    

328
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,791
       I came to bring you home.

329
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,963
    Dennis, this is my home.    
          Come inside.          

330
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,467
       I just cleaned up.       

331
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,168
     I can't have you come      
        into the house.         

332
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,670
      You'll make a mess.       

333
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,772
           Look, papa           
  hasn't forgotten about you.   

334
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,675
  Ooh, been saving up a stash   
       for my best girl!        

335
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,378
     [laughs] Bon appétit!      

336
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,713
           Come sit.            

337
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,182
Let me take care                
of this for you.                

338
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,486
          But that's your helmet
          from when you ruled   
          the Monster Army.     

339
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,788
And now it's ruling             
the garbage.                    

340
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,823
                That was a piece
                of your legacy. 

341
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,792
I'm done with that part         
of my life.                     

342
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,362
Now how about a drink, you?     
Nothing too fizzy, of course.   

343
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,164
Make yourself comfortable.      

344
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,833
Could you ask mother and father 
if they'd like a beverage?      

345
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,903
     Uh, mother and father?     

346
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,807
Dennis, do you want             
crushed ice or regular?         

347
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,876
[humming happily]               

348
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,377
Oh, thank you, Mother,          

349
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,013
I do make the best sodas,       
don't I?                        

350
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,817
   Thanks, yeah, look, Ludo?    
      You gotta come home.      

351
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,752
Mom and Dad                     
are driving me nuts.            

352
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,990
       But you can't say that   
       in front of them, Dennis.

353
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,560
Okay, fine, Ludo,               
let's just go talk              
in the kitchen, then.           

354
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,865
Look, I really,                 
really need you                 
to come home.                   

355
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,501
          - I am home.          
- No, Ludo, I'm at my wits' end.

356
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,103
The yelling, the berating,      

357
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,871
the stupid                      
scratch n' sniff stickers.      

358
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,941
All they do is push me around   
and talk trash about you!       

359
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,910
     What are you talking about,
     Dennis?                    

360
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:29,113
      Mother and Father love us!

361
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,015
   They're so happy you're here!

362
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,918
        We're even going to play
        cha-rahds after dinner! 

363
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:37,021
         They always let me win!
         [giggles]              

364
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,923
 - What are you talking about-- 
        - Just kidding!         

365
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,725
           I'm just really good 
           at cha-rahds.        

366
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,794
           Now stop worrying.   

367
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,729
           That's not the Dennis
           I barely remember.   

368
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,265
              Make that frowny  
              turn upside-downy!

369
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,202
Okay.                           
But after dinner--              

370
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,369
                  And cha-rahds.

371
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,538
And after... cha-rahds...       

372
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,874
we're leaving, okay?            

373
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,810
               Yes, Dennis,     
               whatever you say.

374
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,948
  There we go, all tucked in!   
          What's that?          

375
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,117
  Oh, yes, how could I forget?  

376
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,486
    Good night, my darling.     

377
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,956
They're finally asleep.         
What angels!                    

378
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,959
                  Awesome, cool.
                  Now let's go. 

379
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,828
Go? Dennis,                     
I can't just go.                

380
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,264
            - Ludo--            
             - Shh!             

381
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,800
 We don't need to whisper!      
 There's no one who can hear us!

382
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,335
                    Now come on!

383
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,104
      This is ridiculous.       
    I'm gonna lose my mind.     

384
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,940
        Ooh! What the--         

385
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,510
    Mother! [laughs] Father!    

386
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,278
     What are you doing up?     

387
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,080
      What are you doing?       

388
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,015
           Cha-rahds?           
         At this hour?          

389
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,985
 Mmm, well, you twisted my arm! 
     I'll do it! [giggles]      

390
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,155
This whole thing is a cha-rahd! 
       [grunts] Charade!        

391
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,091
    Just one more round, Dennis!
    Let's humor them.           

392
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,026
   Come on, what do you say?    

393
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,331
    Okay, let's get out of--    

394
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,001
          Where did--           

395
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,435
         I don't know.          

396
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,371
            [groans]            

397
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:04,375
   You know what? Never mind.   
The sooner we leave, the better.

398
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,878
     But mother and father      
        want us to stay.        

399
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,847
         [groans] No, forget it!

400
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,618
   Wow they really wanna play   
           cha-rahds.           

401
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,121
      Once they get going!      
            [laughs]            

402
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,123
    Stop! This isn't funny!     

403
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,492
   These aren't our parents.    
    This is actual garbage.     

404
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,961
        Oh, no! Mother!         
        We can fix this.        

405
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,563
        We can fix this.        
        We can fix this.        

406
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,031
  It's fine, we can fix this.   
        We can fix this.        

407
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,233
       - We can fix this.       
      - You're losing it.       

408
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,970
     [deep] Calling his own     
  mother and father garbage?!   

409
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,373
     How about I teach you      
         to apologize?!         

410
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,976
         [high-pitched]         
    Watch his fingers, dear.    

411
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,377
    You watch your fingers.     

412
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,313
    [deep] What did you say?    

413
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,649
       I said you watch         
          your fingers!         

414
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,085
              Sir!              

415
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,055
           - Dennis!            
           - [growls]           

416
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,157
             [deep]             
      This is what we get!      

417
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,326
[high-pitched] For raising brats
  like your and your brother.   

418
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,928
            [roars]             

419
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,997
           [deep] Oh,           
    but you're a big man now    

420
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,167
 Who thinks he and his brother  
 are too good for this family!  

421
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,970
           Yes, I do!           
           [grunting]           

422
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,011
    Look at you, you're just    
    like your awful brother.    

423
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,279
             Good.              

424
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:20,284
  Because he's... my... hero!   

425
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,553
     [roars in slow motion]     

426
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,123
            Dennis!             

427
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,226
You stood up for me!            

428
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,195
No one has ever                 
stood up for me.                

429
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,365
        Of course.              
        I love you, big brother.

430
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,700
                      Oh, I lo--

431
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,269
                           lub--

432
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,238
                    oh, how to--
                    l-o-o--     

433
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,306
                            ove?

434
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,275
                      Lo-o-ve...

435
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,212
                       yo-- u-u?

436
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,313
                           Tu...

437
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,548
      [slurred] I love you, too.

438
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,117
Let's get out of here.          

439
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,252
We can face the real mom        
      and dad now.              

440
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,320
I can't.                        

441
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,589
Something very important        
happened today.                 

442
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,658
But I have lots more            
I need to work through          

443
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,226
before I can leave.             

444
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,295
         Well, I'm here to help.

445
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,563
       You're not alone anymore,
       big brother.             

446
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,299
I know that now.                

447
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,601
But I have to do                
this part on my own.            

448
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,970
          But... you're my hero.

449
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,173
      No one else in the family 
      was brave enough to leave.

450
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,142
              I can't stand up  
              to them on my own.

451
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:22,213
Dennis, you just did.           
Did you see that dunk?          

452
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,417
     You can jump higher        
     than they could ever reach.

453
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,086
       You need to go           
       find your own adventures.

454
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,424
              You're going to be
              just fine, kiddo. 

455
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,526
       Take good care of Spider.

456
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,995
         She's quiet,           
         but she's a smart lady.

457
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,097
And I'll take care              
of Bird, too.                   

458
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,500
       I don't know who that is.
       Goodbye.
