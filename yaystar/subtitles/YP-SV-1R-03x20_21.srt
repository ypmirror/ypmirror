00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,866
         Stop yelling.          

121
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,868
                 No, it feels   
                 good right now.

122
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,037
         No, I mean it.         
  Stop yelling for one second.  

123
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,739
       Do you hear that?        

124
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,307
                    I don't hear
                    anything.   

125
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,542
              Exactly.          
           They stopped.        

126
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,044
           [silence]            

127
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,712
             Phew!              

128
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,048
               Oh, thank karate.
               Now let's get--  

129
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,535
Are they still                  
following us though?            

130
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,371
      - [loud screeching]       
             - Yep.             

131
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,908
                They're blocking
                the exit.       

132
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,977
Don't, stop. Marco,             
you'll hurt the pigeons.        

133
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,348
                             Oh!

134
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,118
Oh, hey, girl,                  
can I just ask you              
something so quickly?           

135
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,020
What the heck-y was that?!      

136
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,289
We were almost                  
out of this trash castle.       

137
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,759
    If we hurt the pigeons,     
     we're never gonna get      
   Rich to sign the petition.   

138
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,796
    You really think that's     
   still a possibility, Star?   

139
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,099
            [cooing]

       [nervous laughter]       

141
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,068
          Hey, birds.           

142
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,937
            Buddies.            

143
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,074
       About all this...        
        we are so sorry.        

144
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,112
This is very normal             
for me; it happens.             

145
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,914
I know how                      
to deal with it.                

146
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,120
                  Pony Head!    

147
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,488
I know what I am.               

148
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,758
      Okay, we're so sorry      

149
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,259
           things got           
       so out of hand...        

150
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,329
           or claw...           
       or whatever you...       

151
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,099
    Okay, listen, how about     
 we all just please start over. 

152
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,335
    We didn't mean any harm     
     to Prince Rich Pigeon.     

153
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,204
      We just wanted to...      

154
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,273
                 Pony Head!!    

155
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,908
I thought that we might         
need him for leverage.          

156
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,777
        Cool. Can't wait to die.

157
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,981
        [loud squawking]        

158
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,286
[angry squawking]               

159
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,858
       How is this a fair trial?
       We don't even know       
       what they're saying.     

160
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,327
         Um, excuse me.         

161
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,662
               King Pigeon, sir.
               I just want to   
               apologize again  

162
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,631
               for what happened
               here today.      

163
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,167
        We did not mean         
    to break your son's leg.    

164
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,969
Yeah, like, in                  
a thousand pieces.              

165
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,337
                   I was gentle.

166
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,838
      Okay, let's just...       

167
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,040
   We didn't come here today    
        to hurt anyone.         

168
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,543
       We just came here        
   to ask your son for help.    

169
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,478
[angry cooing]                  

170
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,915
          [gong rings]

        [loud footsteps]        

172
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,662
        [all screaming]         

173
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,667
Oh, my goodness!                
This is not happening.          

174
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,969
No. No, no, no, no!             

175
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,738
      [yelling]                 

176
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,155
  Awww. Hey, there.             

177
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,090
Ow. That kinda hurt.            

178
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,192
     Ow, ow, ow.                

179
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,728
Okay, okay.                     
Ow. That's annoying. Ow!        

180
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,431
       Oh, I heard about        
          this before.          

181
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,267
         It's death by          
       a thousand pecks.        

182
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,835
               Ow. Well... ow...

183
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,104
          this is gonna... ow...
          take forever. Ow.     

184
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,540
          [door opens]          

185
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,252
         Set them free!         

186
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,254
       - [voice echoing]        
      - [angry squawking]       

187
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,556
         He can talk?!          
           I knew it!           

188
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,459
And it's such a strong,         
handsome man voice, too.        

189
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,228
Oh, my goodness.                
Hello.                          

190
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,932
    Yes, Father, I disobeyed    
          pigeon law,           

191
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,968
          and learned           
       the Mewni tongue.        

192
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,103
          But I did it          
   for our kingdom's future.    

193
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:36,207
   Why must we proud pigeons    
      continue to pretend       

194
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,809
    to be mindless animals?     

195
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,379
       Princess Butterfly       
   champions a noble cause--    

196
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,481
      peace and friendship      

197
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,416
      between the powerful      
      and the downtrodden.      

198
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,253
 We must not let our prejudices 
      against the Mewmins       

199
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,490
    prevent us from joining     
     her fight for justice.     

200
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,127
         We are a small         
       but mighty empire.       

201
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,795
      I love this kingdom,      

202
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,000
       and it is my duty        
  as its prince to protect it,  

203
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,168
     but it is also my duty     
       to bring it forth        

204
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,137
        into the future.        

205
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,574
        Star Butterfly,         
     you have inspired me.      

206
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,776
    Seeing you work so hard,    
     it makes me want to be     

207
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,578
        a greater prince        
        for the pigeons.        

208
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,048
      Nay, nay, nay, nay.       
       For all of Mewni.        

209
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:24,055
     [triumphant squawking]     

210
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,095
           We did it.           
   We got all the signatures!   

211
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,998
    Yeah, thank you so much!    

212
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,167
      And, uh, sorry about      
    busting up your castle.     

213
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,103
       No, no, the damage       
         you did today          

214
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,105
      was far less damage       
          than we did           

215
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,375
     - when we conquered it     
     for ourselves.             
     - Conquered? From who?     

216
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,978
     Oh, you didn't notice      
     the skeleton rotting       
     in the hall?               

217
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,547
             Uh...              
       [nervous laughter]       

218
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,949
          [chuckling]           
        Enough business.        

219
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,685
       Now we must feast        

220
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,486
          to celebrate          
       our new beginning.       

221
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:59,357
            Finally!            
         I am starving!         

222
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,492
           I could really go for
           some pizza or, like, 

223
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,661
                 a bunch of soda
                     chips...   

224
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,230
               So you know what?
               You keep living  

225
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,366
                 your best life,
                 all right, and 
                 I'm just gonna 

226
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,902
              head out and not  
              stay here anymore.
              Bye-bye!          

227
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,412
   Is this the doorbell or...   

228
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,414
          [loud buzzer          
         and whinnying]         

229
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,982
       Oh, what did I do?       

230
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,551
            [Pony Head]         
            <i> What are you doing?</i>

231
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,253
         Uh, I'm sorry.         
   I just rang the doorbell.    

232
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,589
     <i> That's not a doorbell.</i>    
  <i> I'll come down and get you.</i>  

233
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,358
       Oh, my gosh, Star!       

234
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,195
           Pony Head!           
     Good to see you, girl.     

235
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,230
Check out                       
what I brought.                 

236
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,032
                Oh, my goodness!

237
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,768
              That is the finest
              casserole I have  
              ever seen, girl.  

238
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,438
  Maybe this night might not    
  be a total disaster after all.

239
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,440
Right? Wait, what?              

240
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,376
       I've been trying to spare
       you from my sisters,     
       I really have,           

241
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,245
              but at this point,
              I need back-up.   

242
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,447
What? They've always            
been so nice to me.             

243
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,583
      You do not know them      
        like I do, Star.        

244
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,885
          They're like          
   peanut butter and jealous.   

245
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,620
     They have been trying      
   to take me down for years,   

246
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,289
        all because I'm         
  next in line for the throne.  

247
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,292
        Not to mention that     
        I'm so beautiful        
        and talented and humble.

248
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,361
         Oh, Pony Head.         

249
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,463
     - I'm sure                 
     they're not that bad.      
     - Star, look at me.        

250
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:16,100
      They are long-faced,      
      two-faced monsters.       

251
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,469
              All right,        
              listen up, people.

252
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,305
           Okay, my friend Star 
           is here for our meal,

253
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,241
             and we are going   
             to act like normal,

254
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,611
      like a normal family      
   that spends time together.   

255
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,346
          Like normal.          

256
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,316
        Hey, Azniss. No.        

257
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,885
                   Okay, that is
                   not normal.  

258
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,887
          This is what I'm      
          talking about, people.

259
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,989
       Oh, no, it's fine.       

260
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,324
   You guys don't have to do    
    anything special for me.    

261
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,961
         Just act like          
       I'm not even here.       

262
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,000
Pony Head, I forgot             
everyone's names.               

263
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,336
            Oh, hey, Star forgot
            y'all's names.      

264
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,807
          - Roll call!          
         - [stammering]         

265
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,142
        - Baby Pranciss.        
        - Hornanne.             
        - Jen-Jen.              

266
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,443
         - Pamanda.             
         - Khrystalle.          

267
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,512
           - Angel.             
           - Azniss.            

268
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,182
        No! Get back to         
      the table right now!      

269
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:07,185
 You don't introduce yourselves 
     with a musical number.     

270
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,987
             You say your name. 
             Just say your name.

271
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,490
            Where are the twins?
            Shonda and Shinda.  

272
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,295
       - [both] Yes?            
       - Get your creepy        
       selves over here.        

273
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,130
         You guys               
       are so weird.            

274
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,965
       Ugh! Are we ready        
            to eat?             

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,366
             Food?              

276
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,368
          Yes, Daddy,           
       it's time to eat.        

277
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,805
        - Get down here.        
       - [goofy laughter]       

278
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:40,318
           Fooooood!!           

279
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,188
         Well, dig in.          

280
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,861
   [Star chuckles nervously]    

281
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,863
        Hey, Pony Head,         

282
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,531
         is it okay if          
       I skip the trough,       

283
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,535
      and eat this cupcake      
    that's on a plate here?     

284
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,504
      That's Teta's plate.      
          She ran off.          

285
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,506
         We always make         
        a plate for her,        

286
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,342
       in the hopes that        
   she'll come back one day.    

287
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,744
   I hope she's not prettier    
        than me, though.        

288
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,514
         She probably ran off   
         because she can't stand
         your sorry butts, okay?

289
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,818
      She ran off because       
     you're always throwing     
     her shade, Pony Head.      

290
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,087
     She's always throwing      
            me shade            

291
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,389
     by doing her homework      
     and then being, like,      

292
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,358
       "I'm gonna donate        
          to charity."          

293
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,926
     You know what I mean?      
    Like, that's very rude.     

294
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,395
        [music playing]         

295
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,496
       Shonda and Shinda.       

296
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,198
       [music continues]        

297
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,666
             What are you doing?

298
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,735
    [both] We wanted to play    

299
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,571
      some of our original      
        music for Star.         

300
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,606
      Nobody wants to hear      
      your creepy singing       

301
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,375
    except for dead people.     

302
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,578
             Are we at          
             a haunted house?   
             See what I mean?   

303
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,579
I don't know,                   
I think it's kinda sweet.       

304
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,080
          I miss Teta!          

305
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,216
      How do you even know      
          who Teta is?          

306
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,084
       You were a zygote        
     when she disappeared.      

307
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,086
          - Not cool.           
         - Really mean.         

308
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,454
       [angry chattering]       

309
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,590
        Now, now, girls,        
          settle down.          

310
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,458
           [slurping]           

311
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,594
               I'm sorry you all
               can't handle     

312
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,796
                 how on point   
                 I am right now.

313
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,265
              Can't trust anyone
              in this house.    

314
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,268
                 Not even       
                 my best friend.

315
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,070
                I'm just gonna  
                go check on her.

316
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,874
         Knock, knock.          
         Can I come in?         

317
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,709
                    [loud belch]

318
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,644
        So...                   

319
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,080
I'm really sorry                
you felt ganged-up              
on down there,                  

320
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,282
but you gotta admit,            
you were being                  

321
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,418
       a little intense,        
             right?

323
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,325
        Hey, Pony Head.         

324
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,660
        Guess what's in         
        the casserole...        

325
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,095
that I made.                    

326
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,169
Just take a wild guess.         

327
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,340
All right,                      
I'll just tell you.             

328
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,242
It is gingerbread               
and ice cream.                  

329
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,278
      Why don't you go eat it   
          with my sisters       

330
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,480
               since you think  
               they're so great?

331
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,783
         - Oh, fine.            
         - [door slams]         

332
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,620
             This casserole     
             is delicious, Star.

333
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,656
         Yeah, I know.          

334
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,624
               Was Pony Head    
               mean to you, too?

335
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,326
        I don't get it.         

336
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,695
    It's seems like she just    
    flipped out of nowhere.

       [sighs] Don't beat       
     yourself up about it.      

338
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,633
        She's like that         
         all the time.          

339
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,769
     You haven't picked up      
          on that yet?          

340
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,606
   I guess she can sometimes    
       be a little bit--        

341
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,308
Of a party pooper.              
We know.                        

342
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,711
She's pooped on                 
our parties more times          
than I can even count.          

343
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,681
And then, she                   
makes fun of me                 

344
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,317
'cause I don't know             
all of my numbers yet.

[whimpering]                    

346
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,520
        You poor thing.         

347
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,790
Guess who's developed           
a complex?                      

348
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,558
            - Uh...             
          - All of us.          

349
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,127
          We all did.           

350
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,695
        She messed us up        
           real good.           

351
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,130
It's true.                      

352
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,865
Because of                      
Pony Head's attitude,           

353
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,334
  I became terribly insecure,   

354
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,569
        and now, I have         
    to compensate by putting    

355
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:49,707
      all of my self-worth      
  into my jaw-dropping beauty.  

356
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,710
   It's real hard, you guys,    

357
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,079
     and I do it every day.     
           Every day.           

358
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,082
I've never known Pony Head      
to be so horrible.              

359
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,317
             [both] At least    
             we have each other.

360
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,754
Yeah, we don't need             
no stinkin' Pony Head           
to have a good time.            

361
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,692
      We can show you how       
   a real pony head parties.    

362
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,762
      Now you look fierce.      

363
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,431
       Thanks, Pranciss.        

364
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,167
           Yo, Star,            
        check this out.         

365
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,836
           Oh, cool.            
           Fun trick.           

366
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,771
          Huh? What do          
           you think?           

367
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,373
I wasn't done.                  

368
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,176
           [groaning]           

369
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,778
          I'm not sure          
   what just happened there.    

370
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,447
          You should be honored.

371
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,783
              She only does that
              for her sisters.  

372
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,086
You're totally like             
one of the family now.          

373
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,755
            - I am?             
      - [all] Absolutely.       

374
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,258
      Oh, yay! I've always      
        wanted sisters.         

375
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,794
        You know what's the most
        awesomest thing about   
        having sisters?         

376
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,763
    Arguing over the remote?    

377
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,467
      That's a good guess,      
  but it's actually a secret.   

378
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,635
      Do you like secrets?      

379
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,137
            Usually.            

380
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,473
Do you like                     
projects?                       

381
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,275
              Yes.              

382
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,612
Cool, 'cause we've got          
this super secret project       

383
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,515
we've been working on,          
and we'd love to get            
your thoughts on it.            

384
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,983
                   Sweet!       

385
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,789
Check it out.                   

386
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,792
             Wait.              
          Teta on ice?          

387
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,494
        I thought Teta ran off. 

388
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,262
Oh, baby, we're                 
hatching a plot                 

389
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,865
to depose Pony Head             
as heir to the throne.          

390
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,503
               [giggles]        
                  No.           

391
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,439
             Yeah.              
           [laughs].            

392
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,941
You saw how she is.             

393
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,643
She's unfit to lead.            

394
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,845
         Yeah, look, we've      
         got it all figured out.

395
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,747
Pony Law states that            

396
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:41,285
       if a pony princess       
puts one of her sisters on ice, 

397
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,853
    she can never be queen.     

398
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,788
                So we're putting
                Teta on ice,    

399
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,091
               and framing      
               Pony Head for it.

400
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,460
            On ice?             

401
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,661
     Well, that sounds fun.     

402
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,864
No, no, no, no, no, honey.      
We mean...                      

403
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,001
         [all] On ice.          

404
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,104
            Oh, no.             
    No, no, no, no, no, no.     

405
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,307
       Hey, you guys, ice       
    is supposed to be cool,     

406
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,110
    and what you're talking     
       about is bad ice.        

407
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,212
                     Not really.

408
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,681
          We're just gonna      
          pretend Teta's on ice.

409
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,616
    Ain't that right, Teta?     

410
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,786
    Yep. They got a new life    
 set up for me and everything.  

411
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,555
       I have a mustache!       

412
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,923
     What you think, Star?      

413
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,894
            I got...            
      a lot of questions.       

414
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,864
        I know Pony Head        
      has got some issues,      

415
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,167
      but don't you think       
maybe framing her is a bit much?

416
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,969
              [exasperated sigh]
              Everyone knows    

417
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,205
           Pony would be        
           the worst queen ever.

418
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,373
            She just won't      
            admit it to herself.

419
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:41,078
    This way, the right pony    
  gets to inherit the throne.   

420
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,714
              <i> Me!!</i>             

421
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,416
         Wait a minute.         

422
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,818
       Who said you were        
        gonna be queen?         

423
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,054
                 I thought I was
                 gonna be queen.

424
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,256
    [both] Pamanda, really?     

425
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,490
       No, you're right.        

426
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,159
              I should be queen.

427
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,528
    No, I should be queen.      
    I'm perfect.                

428
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,363
No, I should                    
be queen.                       

429
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,365
          I think I'd           
         do a good job.         

430
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,268
      That makes no sense.      
  You're supposed to be dead.   

431
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,537
[Pamanda]                       
We talked about this...         

432
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,606
      Where are you off to      
        in such a hurry?        

433
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,908
       - Oh, oh, me, me?        
   - You weren't planning on    

434
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,743
       telling Pony Head,       
         now, were you?         

435
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,345
              No!               

436
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,847
         Of course not.         
           Never. No.           

437
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:21,285
   'Cause, uh, we can't allow   
  you to snitch, sugar booger.  

438
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,622
    You're one of us now...     
            sister.             

439
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,058
       And if you betray        
         your sisters,          

440
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,893
        you're gonna get        
       disappeared, too,        

441
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,696
       - just like Teta.        
     - [Pony Head whinnies]     

442
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,699
      Bam, you are busted.      

443
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,901
         Pony, what is going on?

444
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,770
Star, you beautiful angel,      
I'm so sorry                    

445
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,972
you've been put through         
this trauma.                    

446
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,540
  I knew these no class-having  
         wannabe queens         

447
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,909
     were up to somethin';      
    I just didn't know what.    

448
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,912
  And I have it all on video.   

449
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:53,417
    <i> This way, the right pony</i>   
  <i> gets to inherit the throne.</i>  

450
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,719
  Okay, thanks for having me.   

451
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,123
   Because I definitely feel    
      like I've been had.       

452
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,792
           Oh, unbelievable.    

453
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,961
Yeah, so anyway,                
thank you, Star,                
for coming over.                

454
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,963
I know you probably             
feel used,                      

455
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,965
but I couldn't                  
have done it without you.       
Thank you so much.              

456
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,767
          What, are you kidding?

457
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,169
  Pony Head, this is one of     
  the most stressful experiences

458
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,004
              of my already     
              very intense life.

459
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,806
I'm sorry.                      

460
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,008
My sisters                      
are totally insane.

00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,010

sitting up here talking         
about my sisters like that.

trying to leave without         
saying good-bye, were you?
