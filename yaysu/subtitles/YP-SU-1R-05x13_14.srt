 to be a rock star?             

516
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,197
            Weird. I mean, good.
                It's just...    

517
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,534
         I went all out thinking
         my mom was at the show.

518
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,804
       I can't believe I kind of
         wanted her to be there.

519
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,139
         Well, not even kind of.
                   I did.       

520
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,041
There'll be other shows.        

521
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,144
Why don't you tell her          
 about the next one?            

522
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,881
   Hey, Mr. Universe, let's play
    our next show in Beach City.

523
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,483
I'll make it happen.            

524
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:03,321
       That's all, folks.       
      Thanks for watching.
