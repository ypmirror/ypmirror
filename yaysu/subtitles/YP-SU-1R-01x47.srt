00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:28,983
>> Garnet: YEAH, GET IN ON THIS.
>> Steven: N-NO!
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY CARDS!

139
00:10:28,984 --> 00:10:33,521
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PERIDOT!
>> Pearl: OH, YES!
WELL, EVERYTHING IS FINE!

140
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:37,925
>> Steven: NO, IT'S NOT!
I KNOW IT'S NOT.
I KNOW YOU -- YOU JUST DON'T

141
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:44,265
WANT ME TO BE SCARED, BUT JUST
TELL ME THE TRUTH.
>> Garnet: PERIDOT IS COMING,

142
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:49,869
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO OR WHAT
SHE'LL BE COMING WITH.
SHE'S A MODERN GEM WITH MODERN

143
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:54,842
GEM TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BOUND TO
OVERPOWER US.
STEVEN, THE TRUTH IS...

144
00:10:54,844 --> 00:11:00,915
WE'RE SCARED.
>> Steven: WE'VE BEEN SCARED
BEFORE, RIGHT?

145
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:05,920
NONE OF US KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN, BUT THAT'S OKAY.
WE CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT...

146
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:10,290
TOGETHER.
