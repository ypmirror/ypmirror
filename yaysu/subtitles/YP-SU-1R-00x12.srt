            Hi, guys!           

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,474
 Welcome to "Steven Song Time." 

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,109
        Things have been        
      pretty crazy lately,      

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:12,711
 and I've got a lot of feelings 
  that are hard to talk about,  

5
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,847
    so I put them in a song.    

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,648
 Oh, and I'll put up guitar tabs

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,684
 so you can learn to play along 
          if you like.          

8
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,819
      These are the strings     
       in standard tuning,      

9
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,721
          and the dots          
      are for your fingers.     

10
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,656
      Uh, okay, here goes.      

11
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:28,027
           The song is          
     "Still Not Giving Up."
