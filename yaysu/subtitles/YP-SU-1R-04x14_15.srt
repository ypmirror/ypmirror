          Oh, so now I'm a clod?
        I think you're the clod.

460
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,185
Wow! Your Peridot impression    
   is lousy, too!               

461
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,487
      Will you two can it?!     

462
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,357
              That's not a very 
            Steven thing to say.

463
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,692
          I don't care!         

464
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,527
       So I'm not Steven!       

465
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,895
     Maybe he's really great    

466
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,897
        at helping people       
    work out these arguments!   

467
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,066
    Maybe he's really patient   
           and caring,          

468
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,035
     even though it must be     
    hard for him having to be   

469
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,705
the adult for a bunch of        
super-powered children!         

470
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,441
   We're both thousands of years
               older than you.  

471
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,209
  Then act like it!             

472
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,779
Be the gems you've been         
for thousands of years,         

473
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,915
 instead of playing             
  this silly game.              

474
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,117
It's impossible trying          
  to solve problems             

475
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,586
if we're just trying            
to copy other people.           

476
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,221
Oh, what's the point            
      of this?                  

477
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,890
We'll never be the crystal gems,
    we're just...               

478
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,260
 the crystal temps.             

479
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,463
But we have our own way         
  of doing things.              

480
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:09,700
So let's go back to that,       
to fix this mess we made.       

481
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,036
      You do make a good Steven.

482
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,237
      Watch it.                 

483
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,405
             Well...            

484
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,574
      if there's one thing      
      Peridots are good at,     

485
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:17,942
       it's fixing things!      

486
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,144
            I guess I could help
           wash away the rubble.

487
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,213
  And I'll help us              
      organize.                 

488
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:25,116
So here's how I think           
 we should start...             

489
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,218
            You sure            
      you wrecked anything?     

490
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,320
          The car wash          
       looks good as new.       

491
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:33,557
Well, except, we couldn't       
  repair the sign.              

492
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,726
              Well, about time  
              I got a new one.  

493
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,062
               Guess I'll give  
             my neon guy a call.

494
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,665
 Well, don't get out            
 your checkbook yet.            

495
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,333
  Bring it on out!              

496
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,174
               Introducing...   

497
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,742
                 a new sign!    

498
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,511
             For your business! 

499
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,479
           We made it ourselves!

500
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,248
         Look at it, it's great!

501
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,651
       I think I love it!       

502
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,253
       Really?                  

503
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:06,123
     That old sign was okay,    
 but this one's got personality!

504
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,992
Well, it wasn't much            
    of a mission,               

505
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,361
but I guess we handled          
   that all right.              

506
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,762
              I knew you would. 

507
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,931
        Does that mean we can do
               a victory pose?  

508
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,099
        Okay.                   

509
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,935
  Together: Go, crystal temps!
