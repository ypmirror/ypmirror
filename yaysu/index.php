<p><strong>2016-09-26</strong> Times is hard, my lord! Farewell direct downloads and mega hosting, we'll miss you. And TVDB people who cannot decide if we're finishing season 3 or starting season 4 lead us to unconsistent file naming. Well, that's life. But don't worry, cheers up people, we're still on the road and releasing on time. So keep believeing in Steven !</div>
<p><strong>2016-05-22</strong> Cartoon Network decided to publish S03E4-5-6 earlier on french CN, french TVrips english dubbed available on YaySteven as soon as they aired!</div>
