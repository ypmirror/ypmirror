            [ Roars ]

00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,145
          Hi, everyone.         

4
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,447
      Today we're going to      
        make snack sushi.       

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,049
  This is a great dish to make  

6
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,317
       if you're going to       
        have friends over       

7
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,019
    who don't like the taste    
          of raw fish.          

8
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,689
 [ As Lion ] Or if somebody has 
 already eaten all of your tuna.

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:27,526
  Oh, Lion, that [chuckles] --  
     That was a lot of tuna.    

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,496
  And then you just threw it up 
         into my shoes.         

11
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,832
     But I found a surprise     
     replacement ingredient,    

12
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,234
      so let's get started.     

13
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,236
      First, use the spoon      

14
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,738
       to cut slices into       
    the flesh of the avocado.   

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,508
    Then run the spoon along    
     the inside of the skin     

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,044
     and transfer the slices    
           to a plate.          

17
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,312
              Next              
   let's make the spicy mayo.   

18
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,381
           In a bowl,           
       combine mayonnaise       

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,884
   and your favorite hot sauce  
            to taste.           

20
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,486
      I like it very spicy.     

21
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,056
          Let's prepare         
         the sushi roll.        

22
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,724
    On a bamboo rolling mat,    

23
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,827
 place a sheet of seaweed paper 
         rough side up.         

24
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,196
 Using a rice paddle or spatula,

25
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,266
      spread the sushi rice     
     onto the seaweed paper.

 "how to make sushi rice" video.

27
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,773
   Line up your avocado slices  
    on top of the sushi rice.   

28
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,276
Now for the secret ingredient --

29
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,244
          cheese puffs.         

30
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,947
        Make sure to use        
  the smoother variety of puff  

31
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,516
     for the proper texture.    

32
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,686
       Line up your puffs       
    along the avocado slices.   

33
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,090
     Then use the bamboo mat    
   to roll up your sushi roll.  

34
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:36,128
  Now carefully slice your roll 
 into six equally sized pieces. 

35
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,763
           To finish,           

36
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,733
place a dollop of the spicy mayo
 on top of each piece of sushi, 

37
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,103
      and garnish the plate     
       with another dollop      

38
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,138
       'cause it's fancy.       

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,207
   Time to try one for myself!  

40
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,142
              Ugh!              
            Lion, no!           

41
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,044
   At least savor the flavors!  

42
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,481
     The ingredients in this    
   snack sushi are delicious.   

43
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,817
     Be sure to serve fresh     
       for maximum crunch.
