Let me get this straight.       

14
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,431
    Rose Quartz,                
leader of the Crystal Gems,     

15
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,567
    Steven's mom,               

16
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,269
    was actually                
    Pink Diamond.               

17
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,072
    She faked her own shattering
             and reformed to be 

18
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,540
             Rose all the time. 

19
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,442
         Pink Diamond's         
       final command to me      

20
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,277
   was that no one could know,  

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,848
 but now that Steven does, I can
finally tell you all everything.

22
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,882
        Whew!                   

23
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,585
I mean, a pink lion,            
    a pink sword                

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,588
and now a pink Diamond?         
   If you told me               

25
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,124
Rose invented cotton candy,     
   I'd believe it.              

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,992
   Right, Garnet?               

27
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,527

32

      She lied about everything.

33
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,142
             She held our hands,
     looked us right in the eyes

34
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,579
   and told us to never question
           who we are as Garnet.

35
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,515
             We never questioned
              ourselves or her. 

36
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,983
     We couldn't have known.    

37
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,885
                     No.        
        You couldn't have known.

              what's going on.

                  into her.     

41
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,827
               I trusted her.   

42

                  I let her     
           make fools of us all.

43
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,564

45

       Please.                  
We could just stay calm         

46
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,937
and talk about this,            
       right?                   

47
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,007

             is based on a lie? 

49
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,645
                  What else     
              is there to say?  

50
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,415
 Ruby, I'm so sorry.            

51

         Come on, Pearl.        

52
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,019
         Help me explain        
     everything to Sapphire.    

53
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,187
       Right.                   

54
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,292
  Sit tight, Ruby.              
We'll go and get Sapphire.      

55
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,928
                    Okay.       

56
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,868
              Maybe she's here. 

57
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,238

 she was right there all along, 

60
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,045
  using us for her little war,  

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,815
       smiling at us with       
       those knowing eyes,      

62
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,252
  making me believe in a better 
   future that I couldn't see   

63
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,887
     because it wasn't real,    

64
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:40,725
    and now, here we are, our   
friends shattered and corrupted.

65

   Of course she was Diamond.   

66
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:46,498
    What a long road she took   
    to torture us like this.    

67
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,866
            It wasn't like this.

68
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,202

        want anyone to get hurt.

69

       I don't know that.       

70
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,239
 I clearly don't know anything. 

71

 to know everything.            

72
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,578
I was given to Pink Diamond     
just a few thousand years

 to make her happy.

         like me to, my Diamond.
