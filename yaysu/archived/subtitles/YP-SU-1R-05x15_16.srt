00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,988
             These all seem like
                great plans,    

369
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,024
           but how are you going
              to get in contact 

370
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,160
             with everyone when 
          there is an emergency?

371
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,864
       This may be a small town,
      but it's a big small town.

372
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,999
Oh, Mayor Gunga, I could        
  drive you around              

373
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,835
while you use the loudspeaker   
to spread the word through town.

374
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,671
              Cheese on bread!  
             That's a good idea.

375
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,507
    While Jenny does that, I can
   take to the boardwalk on foot

376
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,843
      and let all the businesses
               know what's up.  

377
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,146
And as soon as we know          
of any impending danger,        

378
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:13,017
I'll give everyone a call       
on my cellular phone.           

379
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,387
       It might be easier if you
      just sent out a mass text.

380
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,522
What number do I call           
   for mass text?               

381
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,826
             Pearl, is this your
              first cell phone? 

382
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,261
       Maybe.                   

383
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,397
Is there anything else we can do
 to beef up the town's security?

384
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,866
    It would be nice if we could
      have some kind of lookout.

385
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,035
    Maybe I'll pick up one of   
   the high-powered telescopes  

386
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,837
       for the lighthouse       
          or something.         

387
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,872
                I volunteer!    
             I love looking out.

388
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,209
         If I can't be in space,
 then I can at least look at it.

389
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,111
            Nanefua:            
       This is beautiful.       

390
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,947
         Ronaldo, Greg,         
     you're on lookout duty.    

391
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,183
      Kiki, Pearl, you are      
   in charge of communication.  

392
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,687
         Steven, Garnet,        
      you call for rations.     

393
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,957
   And Jenny and I will spread  
    the word about the plan.    

394
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,761
     Now everyone is helping    
     to make our town safe.     

395
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:00,364
             Everyone except me.

396
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,732
              Aww.              

397
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,036
    Oh, you made                
   things awkward.              

398
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,239
  Steven: "Sadie Killer and the 
Suspects are still going strong.

399
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,075
  They're gearing up for a huge 
 show right here in Beach City. 

400
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,744
   I hope you can make it back  
   in time to see them play."   

401
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,913
     And just as the chorus     
        is finishing up,        

402
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,783
       I'll grab this fake      
  but very realistic chainsaw,  

403
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,651
   and then Steven will hit me  
        with the lights,        

404
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,286
      and we'll all scream.     

405
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,121
Aah.            Aah.            

406
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,725
     And then I'll come out.

              you get it, Dad.  

409
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,900
    We're going for scary scary,
              not ha-ha scary.  

410
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,603
   Oh. All right.               
I just wanted to help.          

411

              Did you cut holes 
              in my bedsheets?  

412

  been making a lot of progress

        teaching improv."       

416
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:56,354
  People of Beach City, are you 
 ready to laugh your butts off? 

417
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,688
                    I am!       

418
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,291

        for you tonight,        

419
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:05,997
        so please welcome       
  the Beach City Laugh Guards.  

420

                    Whoo!       
                    Yeah!       

421
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,667
 Now all we need to get started 

422
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,635
        is a single word        
       from the audience.       

423
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,937
   Pearl: Steven!               

424
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,473
          We do a scene         
    about Steven every week.    

425
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,808
    Well, I think               
those scenes are good.          

426
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,277
               Uh, spaghetti!   
              No. No. Uh, car.  

427
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,712
            No. That's not good.

428
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,647
          Oh, how about plumber?

429
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,282
       I heard "plumber."       

430
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,886
  And now the Beach City Laugh  
Guards will perform a completely

431
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:33,157
     improvised scene based     
      on the word plumber.      

432
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,525
         No.

434
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,963
     And no more suggestions    
    for the rest of the show.   

435
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,165
Thanks for coming out           
on such short notice.

    Well, looks like we're going
           to need one of these.

        [ Steven laughs ]       
         No, no, no. Cut. Stop.

00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,177
     Notes -- Barb, love how you
              set up the scene. 

440
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,980
        Amethyst, you don't have
          to "become" a plunger.

441
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:01,052
       Just pretend to have one.
             Observe and learn.

                    Ah...

00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,990
                    Ooh.        

444
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,359
                    Uh...       

445
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,394
      What?                     
                       Wow.     

446
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,432
That's way too confusing.       
You could be holding anything.  

447
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,766
     I'm holding a plunger.     

448

     Pearl: Oh.                 

449
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,870
I thought you were holding a    
long, skinny submarine sandwich.

450
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,505
         Steven: Pearl!         
            Be nice.            

451
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,674
               It's obviously   
               much more clear  

452
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,577
               if you can see   
             the actual plunger.

             I improved improv.

   than last week.

     intense for a warm-up.     

468
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,751

         a light volley?

00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,966
    Hey, Steven.                
  What will it be?              

490
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,301
             What have you got? 

491
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,938
Well, I deal exclusively        
 in tater tots now.             

492
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,607
           That's great, Peedee.
             Can I get the bits?

493
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,043
  Uh, why don't you             
    try the tots?               

494
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,345
   They're the fry              
   of the future.               

495
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,980
          Do the tots have bits?

496
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,350
      [ Sighs ]                 
I'll get you the bits.          

497
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,719
  I like your super-cool truck, 
             Peedee.            

498
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,555
     I love the giant potato    
           on the top.          

499
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,524
  Oh, thanks. It actually used  
     to be the Mayor Mobile.    

500
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,493
       I just painted over      
       Mayor Dewey's head.      

501
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,329
 It's a good thing that his head
      was so big and lumpy.     

502
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,664
              Yeah.             

503
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,532
 The new city board practically 
    just gave it to me, too.    

504
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,535
  It's like they wanted nothing 
     to do with it anymore.     

505
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,003
       Everything has been      
       pretty great for me      

506
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,239
   since Nanefua became mayor.  

507
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,309
                   Oh, no.      

508
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,678
           All right.           
         I got the bits.        

509
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,513
             Steven?            

510
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,582
            [ Sighs ]           

511
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,517
 Mayor Dewey, wait!             

512
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,187
             You know, Universe,
      seeing my old Mayor Mobile

513
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,690
      turned into a giant potato

514
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,260
    made me realize that nothing
          is like it used to be.

515
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,430
       My old life, my old town,
              my old citizens,  

516
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,031
            they've all changed.

517
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,101
        They've all outgrown me,
                 I suppose.     

518
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,070
   Well, of course              
everyone is changing.           

519
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,105
  Nothing can stay              
  the same forever.             

520
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,708
   You know what I miss the most
          about being the mayor?

521
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,545
      The little things, getting
     dressed and ready for work,

522
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,013
      walking down the boardwalk

523
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,717
              seeing everyone's 
             smiling faces, yes.

524
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,419
           Knowing I had a place
                in this town.   

525
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,189
          I used to look forward
              to it every day,  

526
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,258
            just like the people
                of this town    

527
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,894
            used to look forward
         to their morning donut.

528
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,931
       I guess these days no one
            gets what they want.

529
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,734
   Wait a second.               
   I have an idea.              

530
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,070
   "And so Mayor Dewey started  
    working at the Big Donut.   

531
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,939
         It seemed as if        
    the entire town showed up   

532
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,574
    for the grand reopening.    

533
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,910
The whole thing filled Mr. Dewey
  with a new sense of purpose.  

534
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,046
      He's really changing      
         things up, too.        

535
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,981
        Well, not really,       
        but he is naming        

536
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,750
 all the donuts after himself." 

537
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,618
           Next in line, please.

538
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,220
   I'll have a regular glazed.  

539
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,089
              One Classic Dewey 
                 coming up.     

540
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,593
   And how about a freshly fried
        Dewey Roll on the house?

541
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,961
      Take it easy, Billy.      

542
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,929
       You're going to go       
        out of business.        

543
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,765
                   Ha ha!       
                You're cute.    

544
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,269
 Steven: "But there is one donut
  that's not named after Dewey. 

545
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,405
         He let me name         
       a donut after you.       

546
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,640
        It's a pink donut       
      with pink sprinkles.      

547
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,343
    I call it the Pink Lars.    

548
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:23,013
  Even though you're in space,  
there's still a part of you here

549
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,182
 in sweet, delicious donut form.

550
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,584
       You got to try one       
       when you get back.       

551
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,854
    Anyway, hope this letter    
   finds you in good spirits.   

552
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,757
         Love, Steven."         

553
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,827
    I appreciate the letter,    
   but why did you write this   

554
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,963
 if you were just going to tell 
 me everything in person anyway?

555
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,799
            Sometimes           
    it's nice to be read to.    

556
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:45,369
  You realize I don't know who  
half of these people are, right?

557
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,604
 Like, who the heck is Peridot? 

558
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:52,276
     Someone who misses you     
       every day, I think.      

559
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,511
         You know what?         
     You haven't met before.    

560
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,613
   I'll have to introduce you   
   when you get back to Earth.  

561
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,383
              Huh.              
 Thanks for the letter, Steven.
