1
00:00:03,485 --> 00:00:08,215
Oh... Are those sweet...
carrot pancakes I smell?

2
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:11,425
Mmm... How divine.

3
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:16,435
The aroma... spiced warm apple cider.

4
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:21,945
Ah. And the smell of... smoke.

5
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,825
Smoke? Smoke?!

6
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:27,755
SMOOOUUARGH!

7
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,225
Rarity!

8
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:35,505
You've ruined the surprise.
I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed.

9
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:21,955
Well, g'mornin', Rarity.

10
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:24,445
Father! Mother!

11
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,155
I'll have you know that
Sweetie Belle here...

12
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,195
...cooked this yummy lookin'
breakfast all on her own.

13
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,465
I... figured.

14
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:36,945
I didn't know you could burn juice.

15
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:38,515
I've been giving her lessons.

16
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,415
I wouldn't be surprised if she's
got a cutie mark in fancy cooking...

17
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:43,675
...by the time we get back
from our vacation.

18
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,555
Vacation? Is that this week?

19
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:47,995
As in... starting-this-very-instant this week?

20
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,645
Let me guess. Apple sauce?

21
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:54,715
Nope! Toast.

22
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:58,795
We're gonna have the bestest time
two sisters could even have.

23
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:01,175
I'm gonna go grab my stuff
from dad's wagon.

24
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,835
So... now when you say "a week"...

25
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:08,755
Is that... seven whole days?

26
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,945
And six night, I know.

27
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:13,325
Such a short time to spend
with your lil' sis.

28
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:14,555
You gonna eat that?

29
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,515
But I've got such a long to-do list.

30
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:21,195
Oh, well. I suppose
"spend time with your sister"...

31
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:23,545
...will just have to
be added to the list.

32
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:27,855
Just a few necessities.

33
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:35,865
Now let's get that
kitchen all cleaned up.

34
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:39,355
Cleaned up? But we
haven't even eaten yet.

35
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:40,625
Well now, Sweetie Belle.

36
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:45,315
I appreciate the gesture, but we simply
can't eat *this* breakfast. It's burnt.

37
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,835
It's not that burnt.

38
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:52,045
Never fear, my dear.
I'll get a proper breakfast going.

39
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,495
Can I help?

40
00:02:58,495 --> 00:02:59,705
Oh! Uh...

41
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,175
Of course. Uh, in one moment,
Sweetie Belle.

42
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,965
Let me just get things started.

43
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:14,645
Rarity!

44
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:16,855
I thought you said I was gonna help.

45
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:20,335
You are! You... can...

46
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,165
...put the garnish on the plates.

47
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:25,575
You mean this parsley?

48
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,815
Okay now, easy! It has to be just right.

49
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:30,795
No need to rush.

50
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,655
No! That's too slow!

51
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:34,055
Careful! Back up!

52
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,315
Looking for perfection here.

53
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,365
Not bad.

54
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,295
There are some things I must attend to.

55
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,325
Can you take the dirty towels
to the laundry room?

56
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:04,285
No problem! I'll make myself useful.

57
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,785
Sweetie Belle!

58
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:20,105
I told you I'd make
myself useful. Surprised?

59
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,105
Am I?

60
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:25,585
You washed my incredibly expensive
one of a kind designer crochet wool sweater!

61
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,285
Do you know how hard
these things are to come by?

62
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:29,355
What's the big deal?

63
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:33,375
The big deal is that
in the heat of the sun wool...

64
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,015
...shrinks.

65
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,565
Oh. Sorry.

66
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,725
Well, back to work.

67
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:43,085
I must create.

68
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:45,665
Sorry?

69
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:48,175
Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay?

70
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:49,435
Please?

71
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:53,095
I just want to do something
nice for my sister.

72
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:59,505
RAAAGH! I'm so bored!

73
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:02,165
When is Rarity gonna finish her work?

74
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:05,675
"Stay out of trouble, okay?"

75
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,175
I never got in trouble for drawing.

76
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,235
Hmm. This needs something...

77
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:27,295
Hi, Rarity!

78
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:28,825
I made a special drawing for y...

79
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,745
AAAAAH!

80
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:33,355
Oh no! Did you use these gems?

81
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,145
Well... Yes, but...

82
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,275
I know you have more
in your work room...

83
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:40,505
Bu... but these are extremely
rare baby blue sapphires!

84
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:44,015
I need them for an outfit for
an extremely important client!

85
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:45,935
Oh. Sorry.

86
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:51,075
Sweetie Belle. What am I
going to do with you?!

87
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,495
Oh! We could paint together.

88
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:56,765
We could ride bikes, play chess,
sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight...

89
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:58,565
That not what I meant!

90
00:05:58,575 --> 00:05:59,275
Oh.

91
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:01,795
Now I have to go and find
some more of these gems.

92
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:02,765
I'll go with you and help...

93
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:03,685
NO!

94
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,205
No, thank you.

95
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:11,775
You can help by picking up
these papers and stacking them.

96
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:15,725
Neatly. Put the pens and pencils
exactly where you've found them.

97
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,195
And please find something to do...

98
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:21,395
...that doesn't create
a large mess for me to clean up!

99
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,675
Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?

100
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:35,965
Sweetie Belle!

101
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:37,945
I'm back!

102
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:39,865
Sweetie Belle!

103
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:44,945
Surprise!

104
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:47,555
You...

105
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:49,805
My inspiration room!

106
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:53,415
WHAT DID YOU DO?!
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

107
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:57,555
When I saw the big mess in your room,
I thought I'd clean it up for you.

108
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:01,285
This wasn't a mess!
It was organized chaos!

109
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:04,055
I was just about finished
planning my new fashion line.

110
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:06,465
And... and you... you...
you went and... and then you...

111
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:08,785
...and you put everything away!

112
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,735
But every time I make
a mess, you get upset.

113
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,905
But this was MY mess.
In MY house!

114
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:18,045
And now I'll have to
start from scratch!

115
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:21,995
But... I... I thought it would...
make you happy.

116
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:23,575
HAPPY?

117
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,415
HAPPY?! I...

118
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:31,705
I just need some time alone.

119
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,635
How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?

120
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:49,525
Why, it's smashing!

121
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:51,145
Huh?

122
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:53,805
I just wish we could do
something special together...

123
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,975
...that didn't include me
goofing anything up.

124
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,465
Oh! The Sisterhooves Social!

125
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:00,445
Applejack and I do it every year!

126
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:04,105
You and Rarity could compete against other
sister teams in all these neat events.

127
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,115
That sounds like the perfect
way for us to hang out!

128
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:09,535
Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.

129
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:11,935
What a ridiculous idea!

130
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:14,225
A contest at Sweet Apple Acres?

131
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:15,845
It doesn't sound...

132
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:18,095
...very clean.

133
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:21,925
So what? Now you're back
to hating messes?

134
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:24,465
Sweetie Belle! Watch your tone!

135
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:26,435
I am still your big sister.

136
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:30,595
Right! And any sister, who
cares about her sister, goes!

137
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:33,675
Sweetie Belle! Honestly.

138
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:37,685
Playing silly little games
in the dirt is just... uncouth.

139
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,685
With or without a sister.

140
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:43,785
Well then... maybe...

141
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:47,145
...maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves
Social without a sister!

142
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:51,735
In fact, I think I'll try the rest
of my life without a sister!

143
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:57,195
Oh, I'm the one who's
ruining your life!? Really!?

144
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,875
Have you looked around this place?

145
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,305
I'm the one who would be
better off with no sister!

146
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:05,405
Well, it looks like we
finally agree on something.

147
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:07,615
Neither of us needs a sister.

148
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,755
DEAL!

149
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:11,415
DEAL! GOODBYE, UNSISTER!

150
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,285
"Uncouth"?

151
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:25,065
She said the Sisterhooves
Social was uncouth?

152
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,245
Yeah! Uncouth?

153
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,955
Wait. What's uncouth?

154
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:34,965
It's not just the social.
She thinks I'm uncouth.

155
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:38,175
Honey, Rarity thinks
everything's uncouth.

156
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:40,995
What's uncouth?

157
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,675
It means uncivil.
You know, bad mannered.

158
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,805
Exactly!

159
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:48,445
Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time.

160
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:51,055
She'll come around. Sisters always do.

161
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:54,015
Not sisters like Rarity.

162
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:57,565
Come on now. Apple Bloom and I
got some chores to finish up on.

163
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:58,975
Maybe you can help.

164
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:03,085
You sure you want me to help?
I just mess everything up.

165
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:06,225
Oh, come on. That's just
stinkin'-thinkin'. Watch.

166
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:15,015
Good catch there, Apple Bloom.

167
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,615
This is a chore?

168
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,465
Since we can't sell
the bruised apples...

169
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:26,655
...we gotta collect them all
for the pigs to eat.

170
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,645
It's a lotta work.
So we make a game of it.

171
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:32,755
Wanna try?

172
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,365
Um... Okay.

173
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:36,805
Ow!

174
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:40,175
You're right. It is hard work.

175
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:41,565
That's why we do it...

176
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,105
...together!

177
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:46,735
Rarity never wants to do chores together.

178
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:51,185
All that work ruined.

179
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:53,245
Thanks to Sweetie Belle.

180
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:57,735
Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here.

181
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,155
IDEA!

182
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,505
This is genius.

183
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:08,625
I shall call it:
"Full Spectrum Fashions".

184
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,775
Why, if Sweetie Belle hadn't...

185
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,715
Well. No matter.

186
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,395
She still shouldn't have touched
my things without permission.

187
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,365
Apple Bloom! You're up!

188
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:32,935
You're making grape juice?

189
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:35,145
Rarity would call
the fashion police on me...

190
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:38,215
...if I got grape juice anywhere
*near* her precious outfits.

191
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,005
Well, that's silly.

192
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:42,965
Apple Bloom!

193
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,615
Please, Applejack! She didn't mea...

194
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,175
Whoa!

195
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,485
How d'you like them grapes,
you little whippersnapper?

196
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:50,865
That tickles...!

197
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:57,935
Now to get these fabrics washed
for my fabulous new line.

198
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,545
Oh! My favorite sweater.

199
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:03,155
I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle...

200
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,265
Oh, Opal, Opal.

201
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:15,245
It's as if Sweetie Belle knew
the sweater was perfect for you.

202
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:18,705
And Sweetie Belle should consider
herself perfectly lucky...

203
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,415
...that this thoughtless
mishap turned out all right.

204
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,945
Apple Bloom!

205
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,565
Got it, sis!

206
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:35,135
Wow. It's as if they're just one pony.

207
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,765
YEEHAW!

208
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,785
Way to corral some critters, sis.

209
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:40,665
You could have just asked.

210
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:45,235
Rarity never high-hooves me.

211
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:47,685
Perfect.

212
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:50,765
Just one more and this ensemble is fini.

213
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:54,315
Sweetie Belle!

214
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,265
Where's her silly little
arts and crafts project?

215
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:09,945
Oh, Sweetie Belle!
My one and only sister.

216
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:11,605
What have I done?!

217
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:15,725
All the time I could have
spent with you was wasted...

218
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,335
...complaining and wishing
you were gone!

219
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:21,455
WOE IS ME!!!

220
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:23,275
No! I must get her back.

221
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,915
I must!

222
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:30,225
As Celestia is my witness,
I shall never be sisterless again!

223
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:37,635
Sweetie Belle!

224
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:41,955
I have been galloping all over,
looking for you. I...

225
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:47,105
Oh, hello, unsister.
What are you doing here?

226
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:50,095
Better be careful. You might
get some dust on you.

227
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:54,675
Oh, Sweetie Belle. I want to apologize.

228
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:57,705
I am not better off without a sister.

229
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:00,425
I'm not better off
without a sister either.

230
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:03,745
Spending the day with Applejack and
Apple Bloom made me realize that.

231
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:05,975
Oh! Oh, Sweetie.

232
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:08,115
You don't know how happy
I am to hear you...

233
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:12,195
And that's why I'm adopting
Applejack as my big sister!

234
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:13,155
WHAT?!

235
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,045
-What?
-What?

236
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:18,555
A sister is someone who loves
and takes care of another sister.

237
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,925
Applejack's a real sister.

238
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:26,105
Hold on, Sweetie Belle.
Don't get ahead of yourself here.

239
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:29,115
Besides, she's MY big sister.

240
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,175
Yeah. Um...

241
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:34,005
Or maybe she should be *your* sister...

242
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:37,705
...so she could teach you what
a good sister is supposed to be.

243
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,405
Um, actually I...

244
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,355
Oh, I don't need lessons on being
a good sister. I... I promise!

245
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:47,975
Listen. I'll show you how to
cook my favorite quiche.

246
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:52,005
Or... or I'll show you the proper
way to beautify your mane.

247
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,965
Won't that be fun?

248
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,405
You want me to go home with you...

249
00:14:57,405 --> 00:15:01,485
...so *we* can do what *you* wanna do?

250
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,795
Uh... Yes?

251
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,025
Just forget it!

252
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,005
We're still sisters, right?

253
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:14,105
Well, that apology went swimmingly.

254
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:19,025
Applejack, why do you have to be
so good and make me look so bad?

255
00:15:19,815 --> 00:15:21,065
Oh, Rarity.

256
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:23,595
Once again you're
thinkin' about yourself.

257
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:26,135
Bein' sisters is a give and take.

258
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:28,195
You've been doin'
a whole lotta takin'...

259
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,315
...but you haven't been
doin' a whole lotta givin'.

260
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:32,945
But of course I give!

261
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:36,145
I give lessons. Reasonable demands.

262
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:38,635
But you never give in.

263
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,625
Bein' sisters is like...

264
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,855
...apple pie!

265
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:47,835
You can have amazin' apples and you can
have a wonderfully crispy crust...

266
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:51,945
...but only together can you
have a perfect apple pie.

267
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:58,755
But apart all we are is just a pile
of mush and some crumbly dry mess.

268
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,895
I know what I need to do!

269
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:04,255
I just hope it isn't too late.

270
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:17,375
Well, I guess it's a good
thing Rarity isn't here.

271
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,985
Do I see "uncouth" written
all over this contest?

272
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:24,065
Look at the size of that pig!

273
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:26,025
He sure is a cutie.

274
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,715
That's the last word Rarity would use.

275
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:32,115
"Oh my! What a repulsive monstrosity!"

276
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,795
"This thing needs
a head to toe makeover!"

277
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,165
It's almost time!

278
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,595
Well, you two have fun.

279
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,875
I sure wish I had a sister
to run a race with.

280
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:44,555
Huh?

281
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:45,745
You do now!

282
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:48,605
AB and I figured since
we do this every year...

283
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:51,155
...I'd like you borrow my sis,
so you can give it a try.

284
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:52,615
Sister for a day.

285
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:54,125
No way!

286
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,915
One. Day.

287
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:59,765
One. Day.

288
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,365
Is this thing on?

289
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,805
I don't think this thing is on.

290
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:06,255
Hello!

291
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,295
What a...? Uh...

292
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,755
You have to say so.

293
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:12,235
Confangled modern doohickey!

294
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:15,825
Now's the event you all
been waitin' for!

295
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:18,965
The Sistersoci... The Socialhoof...

296
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:22,525
Oh, dagnabit! You know, the big race!

297
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:25,485
We have five teams
this year for the event!

298
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:28,695
So all ya head on up
to the finish line, y'hear?

299
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,455
THE START LINE! You coulda said.

300
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:34,595
That's us.

301
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:37,915
One. Day. Good luck!

302
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,685
And may the best sisters win!

303
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,475
On your mark...

304
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,805
Get set...

305
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:49,275
GOOO!

306
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:58,785
You okay, Applejack?

307
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:11,325
Applejack! Help!

308
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,815
You can do it, sister!

309
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,605
Oh, it was so close!

310
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:28,275
You almost won!

311
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:30,735
Thank you, Applejack. You were amazing.

312
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,495
I don't even care that we didn't win.

313
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,425
It was so much fun!

314
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,285
Huh?

315
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:41,005
Rarity?

316
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:46,455
Wait. Where's Applejack?

317
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:49,325
I don't get it.

318
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:54,305
We switched places over
at the very first mudhole.

319
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:58,645
So we did the whole
competition together?

320
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,645
That we did, little sister.

321
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,945
Well, except for the start line.

322
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:05,125
But you finished together.

323
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,225
You mean you were all in on it?

324
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:11,315
You did this for me?

325
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,355
Us. I did it for us.

326
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,685
You see? We *are* apple pie.

327
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:22,945
Uh... I'll explain later.

328
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,045
For now, I think we
deserve a celebration.

329
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:27,745
YEAH!

330
00:20:27,755 --> 00:20:28,825
Where?

331
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,295
The spa, of course.

332
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:33,125
Oh, Rarity.

333
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:35,805
No, I... I'm serious.

334
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:42,355
Very well then. What should we
write to the princess?

335
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:43,235
I'll start.

336
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:46,865
"Having a sister is just about
the bestest thing in the world."

337
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,905
"But it sure isn't the easiest."

338
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,945
"I agree, that being sisters
is a wonderful thing..."

339
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:53,845
"...but it takes teamwork."

340
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,625
"Sometimes it's about compromising."

341
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,995
"Sometimes it's about accepting
each other's differences."

342
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:06,685
"But mostly it's about
having fun together."

343
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:10,675
"Even if it means getting your
hooves a little bit dirty."

344
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,235
A lot dirty!

345
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,845
A little bit dirty.

346
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,085
A lot dirty!

347
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:18,075
A little bit dirty!

348
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:20,785
-A lo...
-Hold it, hold it.

349
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:22,975
How about... "a medium
amount of dirty..."

350
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:25,835
"...not too little, not
too much, just right."

351
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,415
Deal!

352
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:36,785
