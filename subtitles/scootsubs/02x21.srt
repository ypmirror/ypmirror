1
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:07,705
C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!

2
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:09,895
There's nothing fun about dragons!

3
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:12,855
Scary, yes.
Fun, no!

4
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:17,205
Fluttershy, the great dragon migration
happens only once in a generation.

5
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,705
Do you really wanna pass up
a chance like that?

6
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,705
Now that you put it that way,

7
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:22,905
yes!

8
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:26,315
Aw Fluttershy,
we just don't want you to miss out.

9
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:28,355
Miss out on what? Dragons?

10
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:31,805
Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?

11
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,355
Well... yeah!

12
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:35,475
Thanks, but... no thanks!

13
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:40,905
Look, Fluttershy, I watched that
boring butterfly migration with you,

14
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:44,055
so now it's your turn to watch
the dragon migration with me!

15
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:45,115
You owe me!

16
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:47,525
I said... no!

17
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:00,205
Okay, I guess
I'll let you off the hook this time.

18
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:07,485


19
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:13,155


20
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:35,545


21
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,175
I don't see any dragons.

22
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,325
Me neither.

23
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:45,875
Me neither neither.

24
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:47,325
Shoot!

25
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:48,925
You don't think we missed them, do you?

26
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,775
No, I don't think so.

27
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,155
We're just a little early,
and I'm glad we are.

28
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:55,495
This way, we can watch
every moment of the migration

29
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:58,135
without bringing any unwanted
attention to ourselves!

30
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,685
Yoo-hoo!

31
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:01,235
Well?

32
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:05,595
What do you think?
Am I the toast of the trench or what?

33
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:07,275
You'll be toast alright!

34
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:09,555
When the dragons see you
parading around in that getup...

35
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,525
You look very nice, Rarity.

36
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,405
But could you maybe look nice
down here in the trench with us?

37
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:18,675
Nice is an understatement.
I look fabulous!

38
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:20,915
Who says camouflage has to be drab?

39
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,065
Ahoy, maties!

40
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,955
Dragons ho!

41
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,125
Amazing!

42
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:38,935
Pretty lame move.
Is that all they've got?

43
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:45,715
What do ya think of that move,
Rainbow Dash?

44
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:46,865
Still think they're lame?

45
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,765
Uh, not so much.

46
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:51,075
The word 'fierce' comes to mind.

47
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:52,805
And 'formidable'.

48
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:55,045
And 'super-duper scary'!

49
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:56,095
Yeah.

50
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,875
Us dragons are definitely
a force to be reckoned with.

51
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,645
Yeah, right, Spike.

52
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:07,795
That's one of the scariest aprons
I've ever seen!

53
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:11,155
What's wrong with wearing an apron?

54
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:14,405
You won't be laughing when you spill
blueberries all over your scales.

55
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,595
Feathers. That's one tough stain!

56
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:20,315
One tough stain against one lame dragon!

57
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,925
You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash!

58
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,125
Spike's style is unique.

59
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,205
He doesn't have
to look like other dragons.

60
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:29,355
Or act like them.

61
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:32,745
My little Spikey-wikey
is perfect the way he is.

62
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:35,195
I don't act like other dragons?

63
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,175
Oh, not even close!

64
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:38,805
But why would you want to, Spike?

65
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:43,335
Yes, you've got something those dreadfully
fierce dragons can only dream of.

66
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:44,485
What's that?

67
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:47,155
The cutest widdle chubby cheeks!

68
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,155
Cute?! Dragons aren't
supposed to be cute!

69
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:52,305
Right?

70
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:55,245
Oh, sweetie, you are turning
the most delightful shade of red...

71
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:56,825
It it is most becoming.

72
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:05,845
Oh, isn't he adorable
when he waddles off in anger?

73
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,535
Waddle?! Arrrgggh!

74
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,945
What am I?

75
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:15,095
Where am I from?

76
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:17,615
Who am I supposed to be?

77
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:20,025
I don't know!

78
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:23,525
For the last time, Spike,
you were given to me as an egg.

79
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:27,065
I don't know who found you,
or where they found you.

80
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:29,955
Seriously? That's all you know?

81
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:31,405
I'm sorry, Spike.

82
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:34,745
That doesn't tell me anything
about who I am!

83
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:37,295
I need answers!
I feel like I'm...

84
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:40,425
I'm looking at a complete stranger.

85
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:44,025
Oh, Spike.

86
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:46,325
Why don't we do
some late-night research?

87
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:47,765
See what we can find out.

88
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,615
Really? You'd do that?

89
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:53,055
Of course!
I'm sure we can find something.

90
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,335
Nothing.

91
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:59,915
Nothing in this one either!

92
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,565
Nothing at all about dragons?

93
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:03,315
This is getting ridiculous!

94
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:07,825
I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies
know next to nothing about dragons.

95
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,575
Apparently they're too rare and too scary
to try to talk to us or study!

96
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:15,535
I wonder if dragons cry...

97
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:16,885
Aw, Spike.

98
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:19,565
It's okay, Twilight.

99
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:23,185
I'm gonna discover who I am
if it's the last thing I do!

100
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,335
Hey guys!

101
00:05:24,785 --> 00:05:26,185
Good morning!

102
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:27,745
Ya wanna join us for breakfast?

103
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,755
That sounds great.
I'm famished.

104
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:33,295
Count me out.
I've gotta get an early start!

105
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:35,105
An early start?

106
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:38,705
Yes! I'm going on
a quest of self-discovery!

107
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,895
I need to learn what it means
to be a dragon!

108
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:45,335
And the only way I'm gonna do that
is to join the dragon migration!

109
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:46,785
What?!?

110
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:49,855
Spike, that's nonsense talk!

111
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:51,195
I know that you're a dragon,

112
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:53,425
but those dragons mean business!

113
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:55,575
They're big, and tough, and scary...

114
00:05:55,725 --> 00:06:00,015
And I'm small, and meek...
and I like to wear aprons. See?

115
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:02,085
This is exactly why I need
to spend time with them.

116
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:04,195
All I'm saying is that
you could get hurt.

117
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:07,875
Darling, this time I really do have
to agree with Rainbow Dash.

118
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:11,545
I don't want those big, ugly,
nasty dragons to hurt one little scale

119
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:13,605
on your cutsey-wutsey head!

120
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:16,075
I'm sorry,
but I've made up my mind.

121
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:19,645
Quick, do something!
Stop him before it's too late!

122
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:23,905
Hey!
Give it back!

123
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:25,855
Hold it!

124
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,685
Really?

125
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,535
Don't tell me you think he should go!

126
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,905
Yes, Spike. I couldn't
answer your questions.

127
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:39,555
My books couldn't either.

128
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,135
I understand why you want
to look elsewhere.

129
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:45,035
I truly believe you need
to go on this quest.

130
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,425
And we have no right to stop you.

131
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,375
I suppose not.

132
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:54,025
I still say you're nutty, but hey,
I've done lots of nutty things.

133
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:55,225
We know.

134
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,815
Well then,
I guess this is goodbye, Spike.

135
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:03,075
We can't wait to hear about it,
when you return.

136
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:04,815
Yeah, we hope your trip-

137
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:05,675
Quest.

138
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,515
-your quest answers some of
your pesky "who am I" questions.

139
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:11,725
Thanks, everypony. I know it will.

140
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,755
Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!

141
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:16,595
Go get 'em, big guy!

142
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:17,945
We have faith in you!

143
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,145
- We're following him, right?
- Of course.

144
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:24,095
Alright,
teenage dragons!

145
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,985
Now that's more my speed. And size.

146
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:32,815
I'm telling you,
we'll never pass for a real dragon!

147
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:36,045
Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous.

148
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,895
One of my finer creations.

149
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:41,745
We'll never pass if they hear
three voices coming out of one dragon!

150
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,875
Now come on,
let's go!

151
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,055
Um, excuse me?

152
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,855
Um, hi.
I'm Spike.

153
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:57,475
You sure your name
is Spike and not Shrimp?!

154
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:03,565
No, it's Spike! I'm not,
I mean, I'm sure about that...

155
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:06,035
You look more like Peewee to me.

156
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:09,335
Hey guys, come on, seriously.

157
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,575
Leave him alone, or he might fly away.

158
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,465
That is, uh, if he had any wings!

159
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:22,605
You fly in on your mommy's back
during the migration?

160
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:23,855
Not exactly...

161
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:27,175
No, no, can't you see
baby Spike just hatched?

162
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,415
I bet he still sucks his claw at night!

163
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:31,595
No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!

164
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:35,215
Well if you weren't just hatched,

165
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,375
how come we haven't seen
you around before?

166
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,775
Well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and-

167
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:42,755
Ponyville? That explains it!

168
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,135
I knew there was something
vaguely pony-ish about you!

169
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,735
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were part pony!

170
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:50,895
Who, me? I'm not part pony!

171
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:52,585
I'm all dragon, see?

172
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:58,235
Or maybe you're a pony
in a dragon costume.

173
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:03,485
A pony in a dragon costume!

174
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:07,465
Ahah... yeah... hilarious...

175
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:09,805
I am a real dragon!

176
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,595
Oh yeah? Prove it.

177
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,415
- Well... how?
- By acting like one!

178
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:16,985
Who's up for a little belching contest?!

179
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:40,915
You think you can beat that, Peewee?

180
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:51,435
From the desk of Princess Celestia...

181
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,595
Dear Spike, please... Ha!

182
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:58,695
Get this, guys! Spike's penpals with
a namby-pamby pony princess!

183
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:06,495
How can he just throw that away?!

184
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:08,715
That letter could be something important!

185
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:12,375
We can't worry about that now,
Twilight, we're here to help Spike!

186
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:14,025
I know, I know!

187
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:17,095
There's no reason to disrespect
Princess Celestia that way!

188
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:19,585
Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed.

189
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:25,015
Ready... go!

190
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:34,845
The winner!

191
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:39,875
Good old tail wrestling...

192
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:43,125
We can't let little Spikey-wikey
wrestle one of them!

193
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,385
He'll get clobbered!

194
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:45,535
Let's go!

195
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:48,965
I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!

196
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,425
Who's this weirdo?

197
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,395
I think he's Crackle's cousin.

198
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:56,055
That would explain it.

199
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:02,255
Ready?
Go!

200
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:13,225
Spike's the winner!

201
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:19,175
Nice going, little Spike!
Maybe you are a dragon after all!

202
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:22,045
Yeah! Maybe I am!

203
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:26,275
Rainbow Dash, I can't believe
your silly plan actually worked.

204
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,085
Alright, who's next?

205
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:33,275
Getting a little cocky, huh?
I like that.

206
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:36,235
So how about you wrestle... him!

207
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:41,945
Go!

208
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:51,175
So Spike, you haven't exactly proven
yourself as a dragon yet, have you?

209
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,295
But... I get an A for effort?

210
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:54,575
Huh, maybe.

211
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:57,385
Let's see how you do
in this next contest.

212
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,045
King of the hoard!

213
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:15,775
This is my chance.

214
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,475
Not so fast!

215
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:28,385
King of the ho-whoa!

216
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:35,115
Looks like this is another
fail for you, little Spike.

217
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:38,365
Can't wait to watch you fail
at lava cannonball too.

218
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:48,235
Whoever makes the biggest lava splash
is the ultimate dragon!

219
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:50,115
Geronimo!

220
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,365
Spike's on his own this time.

221
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:02,285
Cannonball!

222
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,415
What's wrong, Spike?

223
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:15,285
You afraid the lava would hurt
your soft pony hide?

224
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:36,915
Was I... that bad?

225
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,405
No, dude, that was awesome!

226
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:42,055
Nopony could live through
a belly flop like that!

227
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,625
You're one tough little dragon.

228
00:14:56,075 --> 00:15:00,465
Spike, by belly flopping so hard,
you have proven yourself worthy.

229
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:04,595
I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon'.

230
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:07,215
And will now perform
the initiation ritual.

231
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:13,415
Now let's party dragon style!

232
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:23,145
Man, was that a great party.

233
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:25,925
Great, huh?
Maybe by Ponyville standards.

234
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,085
Stick with us, Spike.

235
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,795
We still got plenty to teach you
about being a dragon.

236
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,695
I'm not going anywhere.
The way I feel right now,

237
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,715
I could hang out with you guys forever.

238
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:37,565
Forever?!

239
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:47,225
Spikey-wikey is going to stay
with these awful dragons? Forever?

240
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,505
Oh no, this is terrible!

241
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:52,465
I should've stopped him back
at the library when I had the chance!

242
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:55,125
No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault!

243
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,155
I encouraged him to go!

244
00:15:57,305 --> 00:16:01,155
Y'know, Spike, I think you just might
be ready for a real dragon raid.

245
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,955
There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby,

246
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,855
and we're gonna swipe 'em!

247
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:11,675
Aren't you totally psyched
to go on this raid?

248
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:13,865
Oh yeah, I'm excited.

249
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,535
I mean, I'm psyched.

250
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:18,205
Alright then. Let's fly!

251
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:24,955
Sorry guys! Guess I'll meet you
back here at the crater!

252
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:28,075
After the whole raid thing's over?
We'll totally hang then!

253
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:33,685
Oh no, they took Spike!
We've gotta go after them!

254
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:41,705
Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!

255
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:44,135
And you're ruining my fabulous costume!

256
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,755
I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!

257
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:51,435
Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!

258
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:01,265
Alright, Spike,
since you're a rookie dragon,

259
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:04,205
you get to lure the parents
away from the nest.

260
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,515
Huh... lucky me...

261
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:08,325
Well go on, then!

262
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:11,455
Hey Mr and Mrs Phoenix!

263
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,745
I was hoping I could have a word with you?

264
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:19,445
I'd like to ask you
some questions actually...

265
00:17:19,595 --> 00:17:21,355
We haven't got all day, Spike!

266
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:26,035
Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!

267
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:34,775
What the...

268
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,155
The eggs have hatched.

269
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,605
What do we do now?

270
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:42,255
We take the hatchlings, of course!

271
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,055
Get 'em!

272
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:21,145
Get them!

273
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:37,965
They got away! I hate that!

274
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,895
What have we got here?

275
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:48,765
What happened?

276
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:49,915
They got away!

277
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:52,825
You stole an egg?

278
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:57,205
I guess the raid wasn't
a total waste after all.

279
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:01,355
Nice going, Spike.

280
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:03,845
Well, what are you
waiting for, Spike?

281
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:04,995
Smash it!

282
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,485
- Smash the egg?
- Yeah!

283
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:11,335
Yeah, throw it on the ground
as hard as you can!

284
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:17,905
Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!
Smash it! Smash it!

285
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:29,225
No! It's just a defenseless egg,
like I was!

286
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,805
And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!

287
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:33,385
- What did you say?
- I said, no!

288
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:35,315
No one says no to me.

289
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:46,415
Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!

290
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:47,565
That's right!

291
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:50,405
Fighting's not really my thing,
I'm more into fashion,

292
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:54,605
but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch
one scale on his cute little head!

293
00:19:58,135 --> 00:19:59,875
Ooh, scary!

294
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:03,535
Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies
your friends?

295
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:07,655
Yes, they are. And they're better friends
than you could ever be.

296
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:11,825
Now, if you don't back off,
you'll see what us ponies do

297
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:15,555
when confronted by
a huge group of jerky dragons.

298
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:19,045
Oh yeah?
What's that?

299
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,595
Run away!

300
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:44,685
That was a close one. Thanks you guys.

301
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:47,555
Of course. What are friends for?

302
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:52,505
You're more than friends.
You're my family.

303
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:57,065
Dear Princess Celestia,

304
00:20:57,225 --> 00:21:01,545
seeing the great dragon migration made me
wonder what it meant to be a dragon.

305
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:06,185
But now I realize that who I am
is not the same as what I am.

306
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:10,115
I may have been born a dragon,
but Equestria and my pony friends

307
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:13,875
have taught me how to be kind,
loyal, and true!

308
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:18,975
I'm proud to call Ponyville my home,
and to have my pony friends as my family.

309
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:22,465
Yours truly, Spike.

310
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,375
Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee!

311
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:33,165
Stick with me, I've got plenty
to teach you about being a pony.
