1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,280
There you go,
Mr. Mousey.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,120
Now, you stay off that leg
and do everything I told you,

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,870
and it will be just like new
in no time at all.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,040
Oh, you're welcome.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,920
Happy to be able
to help.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,970
Ooh!

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,600
You...found a watch?

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,220
You...
want to be a watch?

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,650
You're running.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,810
Running out of time?

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,650
No. You're late?

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm late
for a very important date!

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,910
The big brunch
for Princess Celestia

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,210
at Sugarcube Corner.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,170
Oh, the princes is here
in Ponyville for a party,

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,170
and we all promised we'd be
there, but I'm not there!

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,220
Oh, do I look all right?
Do I need to bring anything?

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,220
Maybe I shouldn't go.

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,640
ah!

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,890
It's starting!
I'm missing it!

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,810
Oh, thanks, Angel.

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,690
I mean, if you hadn't
reminded me,

23
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,980
I might have not remembered,
and then I wouldn't be there

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,110
and everypony would be wondering
where I was and --

25
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,740
Oh, right.
I'm late.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,710
Oh, okay, then.
See you later.

27
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,250
* My Little Pony

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,090
* My Little Pony

00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,090
* My Little Pony

31
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,640
* I used to wonder
What friendship could be *

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,050
* My Little Pony

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,890
* Until you all shared
Its magic with me *

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,980
* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,100
* A beautiful heart
* Faithful and strong

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,850
* Sharing kindness
* It's an easy feat

37
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,110
* And magic
Makes it all complete *

38
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,400
* Yeah, My Little Pony

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,620
* Do you know you're all
My very best friends? *

40
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,420
So, what do I have to do

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,630
to get to be one of the
princess's royal guards, anyway?

42
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,260
Is the pay good?

43
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,260
Hello?!

44
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,930
Anybody home?

45
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,980
Blblblblbl!

46
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,980
Wah-wah!

47
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,020
Pbht!

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,730
Blblblblblbl!

49
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,150
Ooh, you're good.

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,700
Too good.
I'm bored.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,120
Phew! Made it.

52
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,290
Halt!

53
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,410
Who goes there?

54
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,290
No one. Never mind.
I'll go home.

55
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,800
It's all right, sirs.
She's on the list.

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,510
Thanks, Twilight.

57
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm so glad you could make it,
Fluttershy.

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
It wouldn't be the same
without you.

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,310
How's everypony doing?
Good? Good.

60
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,400
Anything else we can get
for you, dearies --

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,280
Ooh!
I-I mean, esteemed guest.

62
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,820
Everything is fine,
Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

63
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,820
Sorry I'm late.

64
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,740
I had to finish taking care
of a patient first.

65
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,120
Oh, you and your tender-loving
care of little animals.

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,620
I just know Princess Celestia's
gonna love that about you.

67
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,670
I mean,
I hope she will.

68
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,790
I mean
of course she will.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,250
Wow, Twilight,
I thought I was the only one

70
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,300
who got nervous
at social gatherings.

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Oh, it's not that.

72
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,340
I just want the princess
to approve of my friends.

73
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,180
But she's met us
all before.

74
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,100
And read about you
in my letters.

75
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,520
But this is the first
time she's spent any
real time with you.

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,350
I want everypony
to make a good impression.

77
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,810
Well, I'm sure you have
nothing to worry about.

78
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,520
Besides, it's just
a casual get-together, right?

79
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,280
Don't touch me!
Watch the dress!

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,150
Careful!
You're gonna spill that on me!

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,240
Oh, ooh,
that looks delicious.

82
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,530
What is it?

83
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,780
Ohh!
Does it stain?!

84
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,240
Keep it away from me!

85
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,040
Or perhaps
not that casual.

86
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,590
Uh, which is the salad and
which is the appetizer again?

87
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,710
And which am I supposed
to eat first?

88
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,640
Aw, never mind.
I'm not hungry.

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,770
It's okay, Twilight.

90
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,810
So our friends' manners
aren't perfect.

91
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,770
I doubt the princess
will even notice.

92
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,440
Whoo-hoo!

93
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,440
Cookies, candies, and pies!
Oh, my!

94
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,740
Ohh, chocolate fountainy
goodness!

95
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,620
Mmm!

96
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,410
You gonna eat that?!

97
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,830
Hey!

98
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,710
A thousand pardons,
your majesty.

99
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,670
That's quite all right.
Thank you.

100
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,430
Empty teacup at 4:00!

101
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,930
I see it, honey bun!

102
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,230
Oh! Um, thank you.

103
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,770
Not at all,
your highness.

104
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,690
Thank you again.

105
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,730
Oh, but of course,
your majesty.

106
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,280
Gotcha!

107
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,330
Oh!

108
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,910
And what about you, dear?
Fluttershy, is it?

109
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,370
Me?
Oh, yes, your highness.

110
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,620
I understand
from Twilight Sparkle's letters

111
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,460
that you enjoy tending to
the needs of woodland creatures.

112
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,340
Yes, I love to take care
of animals.

113
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,460
As do I.

114
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,170
As princess,
I care deeply

115
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
about all creatures
great and small.

116
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,890
Nothing means more to me

117
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,970
than the well-being
of all my subjects.

118
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,270
Ah, Philomena, my pet.
You're awake.

119
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,400
Do say hello
to our gracious hosts.

120
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,660
Oh...my.

121
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,280
She is quite a sight,
isn't she?

122
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,990
I...I...

123
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,700
I've never seen
anything like it.

124
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,420
Really?
Well, if I must.

125
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,260
I'm sorry, everypony.

126
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm afraid I have
to cut the party short.

127
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,430
The mayor has requested
an audience with me.

128
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,020
Royal duty calls.
Thank you for a wonderful time.

129
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,060
It's been a joy
getting to know you all better.

130
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,150
Phew!

131
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,160
Now I can eat something!

132
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,620
I'm starved!

133
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,580
Whoo!

134
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,960
Ha ha! Whoo! Ha ha!

135
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,420
Stay right where you are!

136
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,590
All I want is a clear path
to the exit.

137
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,210
Nobody move,
and my dress won't get hurt!

138
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,340
Stay back!
Back, I say!

139
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,520
Well, Spike,
I don't know for sure

140
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,480
how things went
with the princess,

141
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,810
but at least no big disasters
happened.

142
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,650
Oh, you poor, little thing.

143
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,320
How did you ever get in
such bad condition?

144
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,700
Don't you worry,
Philomena.

145
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,660
I'll nurse you back to health
as a favor to the princess,

146
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,910
who's obviously just far too
busy to care for you properly.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,840
I'm sure the princess
will appreciate the help.

148
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,340
Oh, my!

149
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,220
We'd better get you to bed
right away.

150
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,850
There.

151
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,470
This is far worse
than I thought.

152
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,390
What you need
is some medicine stat!

153
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,560
Here you go, Philomena.
This will fix you right up.

154
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,020
Blah!

155
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,730
Dr. Fluttershy
expected that.

156
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,910
Always works.

157
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,540
Oh.
Almost always.

158
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,920
There's nothing like homemade
soup to cure what ails you.

159
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,630
Come on, now.

160
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,340
You're not gonna get better
if you don't cooperate.

161
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,470
Mmm. See?
It's delicious.

162
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,970
Good
and good for you.

163
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,020
Here comes
the choo-choo train.

164
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,940
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga,
whoo-whoo!

165
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,700
Oh, dear.
Don't worry, Philomena.

166
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,870
I know what'll make you
feel better.

167
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,410
Wait right here.
I have just the thing.

168
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,210
Look, Philomena.

169
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,880
I brought a fellow feathered
friend by to cheer you up.

170
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,880
Hummingway here
was sick once, too,

171
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,590
but he let me help him
and got better in no time.

172
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,800
Didn't you, boy?

173
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,510
Say hello to your new friend,
Philomena.

174
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,150
Aw, look.
I think he likes you.

175
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,480
* Ah-h-h-h

176
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,530
* M-m-m-m-m

177
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,400
Your turn now,
Philomena.

178
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,490
Go ahead.
You can do it.

179
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,030
* Ah-h-h-h

180
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,370
Oh!

181
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,620
Um, good try?

182
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,670
I know what'll clear up
that tickle in your throat --

183
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,000
A humidifier.

184
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,010
Refreshing.

185
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,470
How's that feeling now for you,
Philomena?

186
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,640
Better?

187
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,980
Oh.

188
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,190
That's okay.

189
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,740
I know lots of other ways
to take care of you.

190
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,860
Don't worry.
You're gonna get better.

191
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,620
How about...

192
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,080
...aromatherapy?

193
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,670
Ah-choo!

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,710
Warm bath?

195
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,180
Ointment?

196
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,150
Scalpel.

197
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,560
Surgical tape.

198
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,980
Feathers.

199
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
Oh, Philomena,

200
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,950
I thought it would be easy
to nurse you back to health.

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,250
I've tried everything I know,
and look at you.

202
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,080
You're worse than ever.

203
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,170
Hi, Fluttershy.

204
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,470
I just wanted to drop by
and say thank you so very much

205
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,470
For making such a
good impression on
the princess today.

206
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,270
What is Celestia's pet
doing here?!

207
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,100
I couldn't leave the poor thing
there.

208
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,690
She needed my help.

209
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,230
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

210
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,110
This is bad!

211
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,610
How could I just walk away
and not do anything?

212
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,740
But -- But --
She doesn't belong to you!

213
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,490
I had to do something.

214
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,530
Without telling anypony?!
Without asking permission?!

215
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,910
But --

216
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,120
I know you had
good intentions,

217
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,290
but you have got to return
the princess's pet!

218
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,290
But --

219
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,960
You're right.

220
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,130
Okay, let's...

221
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,880
...go.

222
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,640
If we hurry,
we can put her back

223
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,850
before anypony
even realizes she's missing.

224
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,730
We were told we could find
Twilight Sparkle here.

225
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,320
We regret to inform you,
miss,

226
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,320
that the royal pet
has gone missing.

227
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,450
Really?
You don't say.

228
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,390
It's that dry night air.

229
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,850
But it's daytime.

230
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,770
Well, day air's even drier.

231
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,020
You guards better be
on your way

232
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,940
if you're gonna find
the princess's missing pet.

233
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,440
Philomena, was it?

234
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,400
Thank you ever so much
for keeping me in the loop.

235
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,730
Bye!

236
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,740
Phew!

237
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,620
What are you doing?!

238
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,950
Going to return Philomena,
remember?

239
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,370
We can't now!

240
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,370
Why not?

241
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,830
You have no idea
what the princess is gonna do

242
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,670
if she finds you're the one
who took her pet, do you?!

243
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,750
Do you?

244
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,960
Well...no.

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,630
But it can't be
anything good.

246
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,340
She might banish you
from Equestria...

247
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,800
or throw you
in a dungeon...

248
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,930
...or banish you
and then throw you in a dungeon

249
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,890
in the place
that she banishes you to.

250
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,440
You really think
the princess would do that?

251
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,400
Okay, granted that probably
won't happen,

252
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,400
but do you want to take
any chances?

253
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,900
All that really matters
to me

254
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,150
is that poor little Philomena
here gets well.

255
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,490
That's very noble of you.

256
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,580
I'll write to you
when you're banished,

257
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,870
unless I'm banished

258
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,750
to somewhere there's
no post office.

259
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,910
Then you'll have
to write to me.

260
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,920
Deal?

261
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,870
Please, Twilight.

262
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,090
You just have to help me
get Philomena healthy,

263
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,380
and then we can return her
to the princess,

264
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,960
and everything
will be fine.

265
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,180
Did you give her
any kind of medicine?

266
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,550
I tried to,
but she wouldn't take it.

267
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,510
Ugh!

268
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,510
Then you have
to make her take it.

269
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,680
You can't be such a pushover,
Fluttershy.

270
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,940
You need to show this patient
who's the boss.

271
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,100
Make her straighten up
and fly right!

272
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,020
She can't fly.

273
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,690
No excuses!

274
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Done.
Okay, what else?

275
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,030
Uh, well, she keeps pulling
her feathers off,

276
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,990
the ones that haven't
fallen out yet

277
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,740
From all her coughing,
I mean.

278
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,910
There you go.

279
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,170
I don't think
she likes it.

280
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,040
Tough love, baby.

281
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,590
You want her to get well,
don't you?

282
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,670
Of course, but --
Next!

283
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,180
Well, she desperately needs
some bed rest,

284
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,510
but I can't get her
to stay put.

285
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,060
One step ahead of you.

286
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,100
It's for your own good,
Philomena, I promise.

287
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,110
Please just relax
and try to get some sleep.

288
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,150
What's this soup
over here?

289
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,150
Smells delicious.

290
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,070
I made it for Philomena,
but she wouldn't eat it.

291
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,160
Oh, she'll eat it,
all right.

292
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,620
Hey!
Where are you going?!

293
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,080
No, Philomena!
Come back!

294
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,270
What are you two doing?

295
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,560
Are you having a race?

296
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,230
Oh, can I play?
1, 2, 3, go!

297
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,110
Mmm!

298
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,150
Excuse me.

299
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,150
Hi!

300
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,860
Beg your pardon.

301
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,160
Put me down!

302
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,740
What in tarnation?

303
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,160
Sorry,
but we've got to find --

304
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,290
The princess's pet bird!

305
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,170
Philomena,
come down from there.

306
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,630
You'll hurt yourself.

307
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,060
I'll catch you.

308
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,030
What is going on here?

309
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,790
Twilight.

310
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes, your majesty.

311
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,710
There's been
a terrible accident.

312
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,920
It's all my fault.

313
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,340
No, princess.

314
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,130
Fluttershy
didn't know any better.

315
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,210
It was my fault.

316
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm the one who did it.

317
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
But you were only
trying to help.

318
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,800
Some help I was.

319
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,930
Will you let me do this?
She'll go easier on me.

320
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,350
But it's my fault.

321
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,890
No, it's my fault.

322
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,640
No, it's my fault.

323
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,730
Wait.
What are we talking about?

324
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,860
Thanks for trying
to protect me, Twilight,

325
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,780
But, Princess Celestia, I'm
the one who took your pet bird.

326
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,400
I really was only trying to help
the poor little thing.

327
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,160
Then I was gonna bring it
right back to you, honest.

328
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,910
So, if you want to banish me
and then throw me in a dungeon

329
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,700
in the place
that you banish me to,

330
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,620
Then that's
what I deserve.

331
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,010
Oh, stop fooling around,
Philomena.

332
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,090
You're scaring everypony.

333
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,390
Wow!
Wow!Wow!
Wow!

334
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,730
I-I don't understand.

335
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,860
What is that thing?

336
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,860
What happened
to Philomena?

337
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,360
This is Philomena.

338
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,240
She's quite a sight,
as I said,

339
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
but nothing unusual
for a phoenix.

340
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,990
Isn't that right,
Philomena?

341
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,040
A-a phoenix?

342
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,250
A phoenix is a majestic
and magical bird.

343
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,380
While it appears healthy
and happy most of the time...

344
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,120
every so often,
it must renew itself

345
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,120
by shedding all of its feathers
and bursting into flame.

346
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,300
Rather melodramatic,
if you ask me.

347
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,890
It then rises from the ashes
fresh as a daisy.

348
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,430
All just a normal part
of the life cycle of a phoenix.

349
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,810
I'm afraid mischievous
little Philomena here

350
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,730
took the occasion to have a
little fun with you, Fluttershy.

351
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,440
Say you're sorry,
young lady.

352
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,900
So, aren't you gonna banish me
or throw me in a dungeon

353
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,450
or banish me then throw me
in a dungeon

354
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,030
in the place
that you banish me to?

355
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,240
Of course not,
my little pony.

356
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,200
Where on earth
would you get such an idea?

357
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,910
I guess I have
some imagination.

358
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,130
Fluttershy really did do
everything she could

359
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,170
to try to take care of Philomena
for you.

360
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,210
And I do appreciate

361
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,010
that your heart was in
the right place, child,

362
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,380
but all you had to do
was ask me,

363
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,470
and I could have told you
Philomena was a phoenix

364
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,340
and saved you
all this trouble.

365
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,220
I know.

366
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,970
I shouldn't have jumped
to conclusions.

367
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,890
Next time, I'll ask

368
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,060
before taking matters
into my own hooves.

369
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,900
Should I write you a letter
about that lesson, princess?

370
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,110
No, that's quite all right.
I think I can remember.

371
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,490
It's beautiful.

372
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,330
Thank you, Philomena.

373
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,950
No hard feelings.

374
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,920
Hmm.

375
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey, you know
what you should do?

376
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,000
You should go over
and tickle.

377
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,850
Yeah!

378
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,530
* My Little Pony

379
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,200
* My Little Pony

380
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,840
* My Little Pony

381
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,880
* Friends
