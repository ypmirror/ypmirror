1
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,345
I just don't feel like
it's quite finished.

2
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:12,605
I know what you mean.

3
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:15,385
It's for Miss Cheerilee,
it needs to be perfect.

4
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:18,025
Hearts and Hooves Day only
comes once a year after all.

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,325
I say we add a little more ribbon!

6
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:21,605
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,355
And just a tiny bit more lace.

8
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:27,915
A few more hoof-prints.

9
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:30,075
Glitter!

10
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:32,825
It could definitely use
just a little more glitter.

11
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,135
Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee
how much we care about her.

12
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:43,375
Just have to get it to the
Hearts and Hooves party at school.

13
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:47,585
I think we're gonna need
a bigger envelope...

14
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:55,635


15
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:00,785


16
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:23,695


17
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:32,875
It's lovely.
And so...

18
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:35,425
...big!

19
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:38,365
We just wanted to let you know that
we think you're the best teacher

20
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,405
in the whole wide world!

21
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:43,025
And we think you're super!
And that we love you so so much!

22
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,685
And we want you to have
the best Hearts and Hooves Day...

23
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:46,755
...ever!

24
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:48,345
Thank you so much, girls.

25
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:49,745
I love it, I really do.

26
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:53,555
I'm sure it's nothing compared to
the gifts you've gotten from your...

27
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,985
...very special somepony!

28
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:58,905
I don't have a very special somepony
at the moment.

29
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:01,355
Really?

30
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,995
How could somepony as amazing as you
not have a very special somepony

31
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:06,705
in Hearts and Hooves Day?

32
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,215
It's alright, Sweetie Belle.

33
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:11,935
I have lots of good friends
and wonderful students

34
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,715
who care about me very much.

35
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,775
I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific
Hearts and Hooves Day!

36
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:18,825
Alright everypony,

37
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,155
who's ready to play
"pin the heart on the pony"?

38
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:28,785
If anypony deserves
a very special somepony,

39
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,115
it's her!

40
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:32,925
You alright?

41
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,405
I'm more than alright,

42
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,285
I've just come up
with the best idea ever!

43
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:40,765
We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee
a very special somepony...

44
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:45,395
- That is the best idea ever.
- Told you!

45
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:47,195
So, what are we waiting for?

46
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:49,595
Hearts and Hooves Day
is almost over!

47
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:53,995
Let's get out there and find
somepony special for Cheerilee already.

48
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,195
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

49
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,845
Now it can't be just any pony.

50
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:04,795
Miss Cheerilee is one of
the best mares in Ponyville.

51
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,645
She deserves to have
one of the best stallions

52
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,635
as her very special somepony.

53
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:16,775
<i>Cheerilee is sweet and kind</i>

54
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:20,615
<i>She's the best teacher we could hope for</i>

55
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:24,775
<i>The perfect stallion you and I must find</i>

56
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:30,575
<i>One to really make her heart soar</i>

57
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:32,325
<i>But...</i>

58
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:33,525
<i>This one's too young</i>

59
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,735
<i>This one's too old</i>

60
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:39,665
<i>He clearly has a terrible cold</i>

61
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,455
<i>This guy's too silly</i>

62
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,125
<i>He's way too uptight</i>

63
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,155
I say!

64
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,275
<i>Well, nothing's wrong with this one</i>

65
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:49,055
<i>He seems alright</i>

66
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:50,995
<i>His girlfriend sure thinks so...</i>

67
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:51,925
<i>How 'bout this one?</i>

68
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,155
<i>He's much too flashy</i>

69
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:55,765
<i>He might do</i>

70
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:58,215
<i>If he weren't so splashy</i>

71
00:03:58,825 --> 00:03:59,775
<i>Too short</i>

72
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:00,775
<i>Too tall</i>

73
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:01,575
<i>Too clean</i>

74
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,575
<i>Too smelly</i>

75
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:08,325
<i>He's strangely obsessed
with tubs of jelly</i>

76
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:12,795
<i>I don't think that we're mistaken</i>

77
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:17,045
<i>It seems all the good ones are taken</i>

78
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,225
<i>I really feel that at this rate</i>

79
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,135
<i>We'll never find the perfect date</i>

80
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,185
<i>Don't wanna quit and give up hope</i>

81
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:26,065
Doing anything special
for Hearts and Hooves Day?

82
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,005
<i>Oh please oh please oh please say...</i>

83
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:29,105
Nope.

84
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,955
<i>We did it girls, we've found the one</i>

85
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:37,295
<i>Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter</i>

86
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:39,425
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

87
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:41,175
Are you talkin' about my brother?

88
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:50,625
Sweetie Belle is right.

89
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,515
Big Macintosh is the perfect match
for Miss Cheerilee.

90
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:57,375
He's really nice, super hard-working...

91
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,195
But he's also pretty shy!

92
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:04,535
He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee
to be his very special somepony.

93
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:06,365
Maybe he doesn't have to.

94
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:11,985
If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee
in a really romantic setting,

95
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:14,185
I bet she'll ask him!

96
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,955
Sounds like a plan to me.

97
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,515
So? What are we waiting for?

98
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:21,685
Let's get out there
and create the perfect date.

99
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:32,795
Flowers.
Don't forget the flowers.

100
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,505
Oops.
I'm on it!

101
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:38,855
They're coming!

102
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,825
This is gonna be perfect.

103
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:44,165
Miss Cheerilee is gonna have
the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever.

104
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:47,165
With her new very special somepony.

105
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:51,275
Hi, girls!

106
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,035
Hi, Miss Cheerilee!

107
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:56,265
So, you three said you needed
help identifying a tree

108
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:57,875
you found here near the gazebo?

109
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,355
That's an apple tree.

110
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:04,525
Is it?

111
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:12,575
Sorry, big brother.

112
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,535
We went and fixed up
the gazebo all on our own.

113
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:17,075
See?

114
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:20,015
As long as you're here,
why not have a bite to eat

115
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:23,015
from this romantic-looking picnic?

116
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,115
Oh gosh, seems like
there's only room for two!

117
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,705
I guess we'll just be going, then.

118
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:35,945
You really think this'll work?

119
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:39,225
Of course it will work,
they're perfect for each other.

120
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:45,365
Beautiful day we're having.

121
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:49,205
Eeyup.

122
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:52,305
Any big plans for tonight?

123
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,075
Nope.

124
00:06:57,805 --> 00:06:59,905
Oh, come on Miss Cheerilee!

125
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:02,545
Ask him to be your
very special somepony.

126
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,625
Oh my gosh, look.

127
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:13,685
Big Mac...

128
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:14,785
Eeyup?

129
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:18,805
You have something
stuck in your teeth.

130
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,295
OH, COME ON!

131
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,905
Well, this has been... strange.

132
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,305
Eeyup.

133
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,485
I need to get going.

134
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,955
But it's always great running
into a good friend.

135
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:32,965
Eeyup.

136
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:42,755
Do you think it just wasn't
romantic enough?

137
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:45,025
Maybe it was too romantic.

138
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,755
Either way, we failed.

139
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:51,425
There's gotta be something else we could...

140
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:54,925
Oh my goodness,
I didn't even see you there.

141
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,775
I'm so so sorry.

142
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:59,985
It's okay Twilight,
it was an accident.

143
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:02,655
I've just been reading the most
fascinating book about

144
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:04,005
Hearts and Hooves Day.

145
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:06,005
Did you know that
this holiday got its start

146
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:07,745
because of a love potion?

147
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:13,605
Did you say... a love potion?

148
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:15,885
That's right.
It even has the recipe.

149
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:21,575
I don't suppose we could borrow
that book for a little while, do ya?

150
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:23,315
Of course you can.

151
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,905
I have another book here,
that I think you'll...

152
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:36,325
Take a tuft of cloud.

153
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:42,135
A bright rainbow's glow.

154
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:50,315
Stir with a Pegasus feather.

155
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,165
Fast, not slow.

156
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,155
Serve to ponies
who aren't in the know.

157
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:05,935
I feel kinda bad tricking my brother
and Miss Cheerilee this way...

158
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,235
What's the problem?

159
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:10,015
We all agreed these two
are perfect for one another.

160
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:12,665
Yeah, they just need a little nudge.

161
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:16,145
And what can make them happier
than being together, right?

162
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:17,945
Right!

163
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,525
Here they come!

164
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,285
Hi, Miss Cheerilee.

165
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:24,595
Hello again, girls.

166
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:25,795
Hello, Big Mac.

167
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:29,755
Would you three like to tell us
why it was so very important

168
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,425
- ...that we meet you here?
- Punch!

169
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:33,425
Excuse me?

170
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,175
Punch!
We made punch.

171
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,165
We were gonna set up a stand
and try to sell it, but,

172
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:41,125
we needed some pony
to taste test it first.

173
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,225
Yup.

174
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,325
We thought you two
would be perfect together...

175
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,195
To test it...

176
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:48,575
...together.

177
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:53,295
So, we'll just leave you two alone...

178
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:56,535
Together, to test it.

179
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,385
I'm very sorry about this.

180
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,775
I mentioned to the girls that
I don't have a very special somepony.

181
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,585
And I believe they're putting us
in these awkward situations

182
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:11,445
because they've decided it should be you.

183
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:18,775
I suppose we should just
humor them for a moment.

184
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,865
This punch does look delicious.

185
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:21,865
Eeyup.

186
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:25,195
I think they're gonna drink it!

187
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:26,595
To good friends!

188
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,325
They're drinking it.
They're drinking it!

189
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:40,275
They're looking into each others' eyes.

190
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:45,035
They're about to be in
for a big surprise!

191
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,365
- Big Mac?
- Yup?

192
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:58,045
Will you be my very special somepony?

193
00:10:58,045 --> 00:10:58,875
Eeyup.

194
00:10:59,045 --> 00:10:59,695
YES!

195
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:07,585
He's her special somepony.
She's his special somepony.

196
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,365
He's my special somepony.

197
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,335
Eeeeeya.

198
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:19,455
He's my shmoopy-doopy
sweedy-weedy pony pie.

199
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:25,515
You're my shmoopy-doopy
sweedy-weedy pony pie.

200
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,065
Did he just say...

201
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:36,345
You're my cutie-patootie
lovie-dovie honey-bunny.

202
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:40,925
You're my heartie-smartie
smirchy-wirchy baby-waby.

203
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:44,235
Big Mac!
Hey! Hello!

204
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:46,285
What's going on?

205
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:49,385
Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?

206
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:51,915
I have a special somepony.

207
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:56,085
A kissy-wissy
snuggy-wuggy sugar bear.

208
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:02,505
I think we may have given them
too big of a nudge.

209
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:06,435
You're my cuddly-wuddly
boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie.

210
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,935
Ya think?

211
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:13,305
What have we done?!

212
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:16,705
My brother's acting like
a grade-A goofball!

213
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:18,955
Maybe we added too much rainbow.

214
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,585
Or maybe not enough cloud.

215
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:23,315
Or maybe... Uh oh.

216
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,795
What do you mean "uh oh"?!

217
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:29,445
We might not have given Big Mac
and Miss Cheerilee a love potion...

218
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:32,465
We may have given them a love poison!

219
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:33,645
What?!?!

220
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:37,365
Apparently, some prince who
long time ago whipped up this recipe

221
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,335
and gave it to this princess he liked.

222
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:44,505
He meant it to be a love potion,
but things didn't turn out so well.

223
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:47,955
How "not so well" did things turn out?

224
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:51,815
Well, there's something here
about a dragon...

225
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:54,865
Kingdom falling...
Chaos reigning...

226
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,875
Okay, apparently it was all because
the prince and princess

227
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,085
were so lost in each others' eyes,
that they couldn't perform

228
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,475
their royal duties.

229
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:05,335
Great!

230
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:07,385
We've not only turned
Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee

231
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,675
into a couple of nonsense-spouting
nincompoops,

232
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:12,955
we may have put all of
Ponyville in jeopardy!

233
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:17,525
Come on, Apple Bloom.

234
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:20,735
Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
don't have any royal duties.

235
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:23,525
But they still got responsibilities.

236
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:27,915
If we don't fix this, Miss Cheerilee
won't be able to teach.

237
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:31,025
Big Mac won't be able to
harvest any apples.

238
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,805
And before you know it...

239
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:40,265
Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated
little ponies starving for apples.

240
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:42,775
It'll be chaos, it'll be chaos!

241
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,275
There's an antidote!

242
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,475
Well, why didn't you say so?

243
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:51,335
Didn't you see me gettin'
all panicked back there?

244
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:54,945
If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
from looking into each others' eyes

245
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:57,775
for one full hour,
the love curse will be broken.

246
00:13:57,805 --> 00:13:59,125
Only an hour?

247
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,675
We can pull that off in a second.

248
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,995
You take the first sip,
snuggle-wuggles.

249
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:09,265
Nope, you take it, sugar lump.

250
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,025
No, you, shnooky-lumps.

251
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,445
No, you, pooky-pie.

252
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,175
I'm all for romance,
but this has been going on for hours.

253
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:19,385
What's happened to these two?

254
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:21,855
Who knows?

255
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:27,875
Well, these love birds will probably
be planning a wedding soon.

256
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,845
I can always use the catering business.

257
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:33,295
A wedding!
That's it!

258
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,015
Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac
should get married!

259
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,925
How is gettin' hitched
gonna keep them apart?

260
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,535
They aren't really gonna get married.

261
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,615
They're just gonna get ready
to get married.

262
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,905
No you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!

263
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:51,475
Nope you, huggy-wuggy
snuggy bunny!

264
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:54,055
Hi Miss Cheerilee, how are you?

265
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:59,705
I have a very special somepony.

266
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,635
Yeah, we noticed.

267
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:07,425
Gosh, you two are so in love,

268
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:10,795
the next thing you know,
you'll be getting married.

269
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:13,305
Married?

270
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:16,905
That's right. Married.

271
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:18,505
Married.

272
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,125
'Course, if you're gonna get married,

273
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,885
you wanna pick out a really nice
diamond for your...

274
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:31,755
...shmoopy-doopy-pookie-pie.

275
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:32,755
Diamond!

276
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:34,915
Shmoopy!

277
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:38,825
Don't you think you should start
looking for your wedding dress?

278
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:44,775
You'll wanna look your best for your...
honey-bunny snuggle-baby.

279
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:47,835
Dress!

280
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,575
Now we just need to keep them apart.

281
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,885
I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied.

282
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,555
You two do the same with Big Mac.

283
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:58,045
No problem.

284
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,695
Meet me back at the clubhouse in an hour,
when this whole mess is over.

285
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:10,025
This one looks nice.

286
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,525
Better try it on now.

287
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,615
Ten minutes down,
fifty minutes to go.

288
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,445
No.

289
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,345
No.

290
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,625
Not that one either.

291
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:35,805
No.

292
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:37,975
Too... shiny.

293
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:40,195
No.

294
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:42,965
You know, something less... shiny.

295
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,875
Miss Cheerilee deserves the best.

296
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,545
How much time is left?

297
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:51,095
I'm running out of ways
to make diamonds sound bad.

298
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:52,885
We still have twenty five minutes.

299
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:57,465
Where's my brother?

300
00:16:57,665 --> 00:17:00,195
He made his purchase
and departed out the back.

301
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,885
Said something about needing to see his...

302
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:04,525
...shmoopy-shmoop.

303
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:09,885
Okay, I'll see what I can do
to slow him down.

304
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:12,355
You go on to Carousel Boutique
and warn Sweetie Belle.

305
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:44,915
What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom?
Where's Big Mac?

306
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:48,625
On... his... way.

307
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:54,385
Gotta... keep him... out of Boutique.

308
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:29,965
Move away!

309
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:31,915
He'll get to her!

310
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:33,685
He's still strong!

311
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:37,925
Let him go!

312
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,715
Shmoopy-doo!

313
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:50,255
I sure am glad we found those shovels.

314
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:58,265
One more minute
and the spell will be broken!

315
00:18:58,265 --> 00:19:00,545
Shmoopy-doo!

316
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,095
Sweetums?

317
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,085
Shmoopy-doo!

318
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,835
Please be normal, please be normal!

319
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,065
Am I wearing a wedding veil?

320
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,245
Eeyup.

321
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:57,555
Are you sitting on a feather bed,
in a hole in the ground?

322
00:19:57,555 --> 00:19:58,785
Eeyup.

323
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:03,745
Girls! Can you explain why I look like
I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?

324
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:08,625
We may have given you
the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion...

325
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,665
...that may have turned out
to actually be a love poison.

326
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:16,795
And you may have gone
just a teeny tiniest bit nutty.

327
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:20,425
Well, we only did it because we thought
you and Big Mac would be really happy

328
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:24,405
if you could be each other's very special
someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.

329
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:28,115
Our hearts and hooves
were in the right place.

330
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:32,535
We appreciate that you care about us
and want us to be happy, but...

331
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:36,355
But no matter how good
our intentions might have been,

332
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:39,415
we shoulda never meddled
in your relationship.

333
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,965
Nopony can force two ponies
to be together.

334
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:47,855
It's up to everypony to choose that
very special somepony for themselves.

335
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,185
We're sorry.

336
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:53,915
And you can think about
how sorry you are

337
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:57,985
while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores
at Sweet Apple Acres.

338
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:01,355
Does that seem like
a fair punishment to you?

339
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:02,725
Eeyup.

340
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:13,215
Hey there, Miss Cheerilee!
What are you doing here?

341
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:16,415
Since you three are doing
all of his chores,

342
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:19,415
Big Mac and I thought we'd
have a picnic at the gazebo.

343
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,425
Ready, sugar bear?

344
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:23,545
Eeyup, pumpkin pie.

345
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:33,745
NOOO!!!
