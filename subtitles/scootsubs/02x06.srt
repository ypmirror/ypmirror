1
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:04,455
Today is the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders!

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:06,235
I can just feel it!

3
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:10,545
Today is the day we are all gonna
get our cutie marks in...

4
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,475
...bowlin'!

5
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:14,435
Woohoo!

6
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:19,195
I mean... Yaaay!

7
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:23,515
Why, after today we won't even be
the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore.

8
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,525
We'll be the...

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,275
...the Three Strikes!

10
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:28,945
That makes us sound
like we've struck out.

11
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:33,245
How about... the Pin Twins!

12
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:36,015
But there are three of us.

13
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:39,645
Okay then. Um...

14
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:41,755
The Bowling Dolls!

15
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:45,635
The Bowling Dolls! That's it!

16
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:46,665
Perfect!

17
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:50,105
Alrighty then. Let's bowl 'em over!

18
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,465
Cool! A bowling cutie mark!

19
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:38,035
I did it! I did it!

20
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:40,915
Blank?

21
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,895
But... But...

22
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,225
But what about my ball?

23
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:39,835
That bowling sure was fun.

24
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,935
Even if all I got was gutterballs.

25
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:45,415
Yeah. At least you're able to
keep your ball in your lane.

26
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,835
I don't think Mr. Kingpin is ever
gonna let me play again.

27
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:54,525
Hey! Maybe I could get
my cutie mark in demolition?

28
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:02,295
Aw, come on, Apple Bloom.

29
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:05,605
I know just what you need to
put the bloom back on your apple.

30
00:03:07,795 --> 00:03:10,725
A treat from Sugarcube Corner
will cheer you up!

31
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:13,915
No, it won't.

32
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,985
A party will cheer you up!

33
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:21,015
No, it won't.

34
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,355
A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.

35
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,775
No, it won't!

36
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,805
Come on, Apple Bloom!
It's just a cutie mark.

37
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:34,905
Or lack of a cutie mark!

38
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:36,645
Shh! That's not helping.

39
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:40,025
Apple Bloom! Where are you going?

40
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:43,035
Apple Bloom! Come back!

41
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:51,425
Whoa!

42
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:59,555
Well. Who is it that we have here?

43
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:03,255
Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear.

44
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:04,885
Aw!

45
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:08,015
What has happened to you, youth?

46
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:12,335
Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth.

47
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,265
Come with me. I have just the trick...

48
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:17,465
...that will fix you up quite quick.

49
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:23,675
I tried everything, Thecora.
And thtill no cutie mark.

50
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:28,085
Why, I'm gonna be as old as Granny
Thmith and thtill have a blank flank.

51
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:30,885
Your frustration is well understood.

52
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:34,045
But one must be patient
for all things good.

53
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:37,885
I've heard that from everypony I know.

54
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:41,045
And now from every Thebra I know.

55
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:43,885
I'm jutht too impathient
to be pathient.

56
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:47,635
I jutht want my cutie mark
and I want it now!

57
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,325
For your cutie mark
you will have to wait.

58
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:58,965
We must fix that tooth
before it's too late!

59
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:05,165
Now drink down every little drop...

60
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:07,885
...and this mixture will
mend that chip on top.

61
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:23,835
Oh my star apples! You did it, Zecora!

62
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:26,035
Golly.

63
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,885
You have tonics that heal
all sorts of ailments.

64
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:32,035
Bad bones, bad back, bad breath...

65
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,215
Yes, little one. It is true.

66
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,005
I have many a healing brew.

67
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:38,535
And not only stuff that fixes the bad...

68
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,685
...but stuff that brings the good.

69
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:44,145
Good health, good hair... good heavens!

70
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,825
Hmm...

71
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:51,475
I bet you can mix up
a brew to fix... anything.

72
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:56,025
There are many mixtures in this room...

73
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:58,825
...but none for what you
want, dear Apple Bloom.

74
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,935
A magic potion does not hold the key...

75
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:06,545
...for a cutie mark.
Time is the only remedy.

76
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:07,865
Fine.

77
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:16,285
What's you got goin' on there?

78
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:20,335
I am brewing up another mix
for a rooster and his chicks.

79
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,655
It seems the rooster
has lost his crow...

80
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:25,135
...making mornings very slow.

81
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:28,995
Hey! I've seen that flower
bloomin' in Ponyville. What is it?

82
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:31,755
It is one we call "heart's desire".

83
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:34,955
A dash will ignite the rooster's fire.

84
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:40,415
With heart's desire his
talent comes into view...

85
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:43,445
...and he'll make a mighty
cock-a-doodle-doo!

86
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:47,045
Zowie!

87
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:50,125
Heart's desire, huh?

88
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,635
Ay me! But what is this?

89
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,515
I've run out of amethyst.

90
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:58,445
I must go get this purple flower
for my brew to have full power.

91
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:01,755
Yeah. You go. You go.

92
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:08,835
I'm so hungry.

93
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,605
Yeah. I can't wait...

94
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:19,805
Apple Bloom! You've got
your cutie mark!

95
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:31,215
Um... Apple Bloom. What is it?

96
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:35,425
Yeah. Is it an "O"?
Is your talent spelling?

97
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:38,405
Or is it a ring? Are you
a jewelery maker?

98
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:42,405
Or ith it a powdered donut?
Cauthe that thouhdth delithoiuth.

99
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:45,325
No. It's a loop-de-hoop!

100
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:50,055
A what now?

101
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:53,465
A loop-de-hoop. 'least that's
what I always called it.

102
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:56,935
Applejack made it for my from
an old ring barrel when I was littler.

103
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:01,015
Who'd have thought that loop-de-hoop
would end up bein' my special talent?

104
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:04,015
Wow, Apple Bloom! That's amazing!

105
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:06,605
That's it? That's your talent?

106
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:10,285
Spinning a hoop around
your waist? Puh-lease.

107
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:13,675
Oh. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

108
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:34,655
Apple Bloom! You're super-duper
loop-de-hooper!

109
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,205
Thanks, everypony.

110
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:41,625
All right, my little ponies!
Time for class!

111
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:47,015
Apple Bloom.

112
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:48,925
Yes, miss Cheerilee?

113
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:53,065
I want you to take your
loop-de-hoop into the yard...

114
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:57,785
...and give us all a lesson in
your amazing loop-de-hooping!

115
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:12,705
Oh! Oh!

116
00:09:16,815 --> 00:09:21,285
Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you
might get to be half as good as me.

117
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,075
Great job, girls!

118
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:28,975
You're too kind, Apple Bloom.

119
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,665
Yeah, we stink.

120
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:33,745
Nah. You just need a little practice.

121
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:35,365
Soon you'll be able to...

122
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,015
Hoop'n'bob!

123
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,775
Hoop'n'hop!

124
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,005
Hoop'n'skip!

125
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:47,175
And hoop'n'flip!

126
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,275
Show us some more, Apple Bloom.

127
00:09:57,275 --> 00:10:01,625
Well, alright. Just a few
more tricks. But be warned...

128
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,175
...these are advanced moves.
Not for beginners.

129
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,985
Got that, Diamond Tiara?

130
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:13,625
I call this one the hoopla!

131
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,375
Another cutie mark? Ha!

132
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,125
I guess that last trick
was a lot of hoopla.

133
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,315
Those cutie marks are fake!

134
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:44,015
What? No, they're not!

135
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:49,145
Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard
of a pony with two cutie marks?

136
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:51,815
I must say that I never have.

137
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:55,325
But maybe Apple Bloom
has two special talents?

138
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:59,645
Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that.

139
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:02,165
-Spin plates!
-Yeah!

140
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,195
Two cutie marks?

141
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:11,325
Two talents?

142
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,025
Aw yeah!

143
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:19,165
Our friend is the most
special pony ever!

144
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,995
Alright, everypony!
You ready for a real show?

145
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:30,755
Yeehaw, little sis!

146
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:35,215
Huh, congratulations on gettin'
not just one but two cutie marks.

147
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:38,175
Oh, we're mighty proud of you.
Right, Big McIntosh?

148
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,425
Eeyup.

149
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:42,995
I've never seen anythin' like it.
Have you, Big Mac?

150
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:44,305
Nnope!

151
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:49,175
Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and
a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin'...

152
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:52,375
...reminded me of when
I was a spry young filly.

153
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,415
Charlie horse! Charlie horse!

154
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,115
That's better.

155
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:03,975
Why, Apple Bloom. I think you're ready
to hit the rodeo circuit right now.

156
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:07,055
Actually, I'm ready to
hit the hay right now.

157
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:11,105
I'm plum tucker.
I'll see y'all in the mornin'.

158
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:12,185
'night!

159
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,465
'night!

160
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:17,745
Oh my! Little Apple Bloom
has finally blossomed!

161
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:20,485
-Hasn't she, Big Mac?
-Eeyep!

162
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,095
What in tarnation is that?

163
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:37,555
Apple Bloom. What is all that awful...

164
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:40,315
...tapping?

165
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,505
Three cutie marks?!

166
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:45,605
Help me!

167
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,295
Help me!

168
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:53,265
Come 'ere, you!

169
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:05,185
I'm sorry, Applejack!
I don't know how to make it stop!

170
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:07,775
Well, I know somepony who might.

171
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,735
Three cutie marks? Three talents!

172
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:16,535
I've never seen anything like it!

173
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:19,775
I was just reading something
about unusual equine illnesses.

174
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:21,595
What was it?

175
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:25,195
"Perplexing Pony Plagues", perhaps?

176
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,855
Yes, Spike! You're amazing!

177
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:32,535
Yes, well, I do have some talents.

178
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:40,545
Hay fever... the trots...

179
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:42,645
Cutie pox!

180
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,675
Cutie pox?!

181
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,925
Cutie pox – this puzzling
pony plague afflicted...

182
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:50,965
...the population of ponies
back in the paleopony period!

183
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:53,465
Say that ten times fast.

184
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:58,495
Random cutie marks appeared
all over the ponies' bodies...

185
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:01,425
...causing them to perform all
the talents that came with them.

186
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:03,255
Just like me!

187
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:06,185
Yes, but what's the cure?
What's the cure?

188
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,575
It says here there's no known cure.

189
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,795
No known cure?!

190
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,895
The cause of the breakout
was never discovered.

191
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:19,105
And the cutie pox disappeared
as mysteriously as they arrived.

192
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:20,975
Oh no!

193
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:26,205
Sacré bleu! Plus de marque de cutie!
[Good heavens! Another cutie mark!]

194
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,885
Qu'est-ce que c'est? Je parle français?
[What's that? I speak French?]

195
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:33,105
My sister's speakin' in Fancy!

196
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:34,265
She needs help!

197
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:37,935
I know she needs help!
We can't just wait for this to go away.

198
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:41,895
We gotta find somepony
to mix up a cure! And fast.

199
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:42,775
Tout suite!
[Now!]

200
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,125
Not somepony. Some zebra!

201
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,865
Zecora!

202
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,865
Hurry! Hurry!

203
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,685
Dépêchez-vous!
[Hurry up!]

204
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:29,655
She's cursed!

205
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:31,865
Hexed!

206
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,965
Enchanted!

207
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,575
No, she's not.

208
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:42,215
She just has some weird, mysterious disease
with no known cure, called cutie pox.

209
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:44,725
CUTIE POX?!

210
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:59,925
I thought I have removed their fear
the last time I visited here.

211
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:02,945
But doors are barred and shutters shut.

212
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,985
Guess I should have
stayed inside my hut.

213
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:09,305
Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox.

214
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:13,725
We were just on our way
to see if you've had a cure!

215
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:17,095
But magically you're here!
Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?

216
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:19,745
My zebra sense did not bring me 'round.

217
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:22,575
It was a special flower
that I needed found.

218
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:26,185
I thought I picked enough to fix
all the potions I had to mix...

219
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,485
...but after my visit from Apple Bloom...

220
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:32,435
...some have mysteriously left my room.

221
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:36,705
Apple Bloom, what do you say?
Did this flower just walk away?

222
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,905
I... um...

223
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:50,105
A cutie pox cure I have forsooth.

224
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:54,625
For healing power is
in the seeds of truth.

225
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,265
W... well then. Give 'em to her! Quick!

226
00:17:57,495 --> 00:18:00,055
These seeds must be
planted in the ground.

227
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:03,765
With the truth they'll grow
and the cure is found.

228
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,365
Come again?

229
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:09,635
The seeds of truth do hold the cure,
but one must speak words...

230
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,275
...true and pure.

231
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:16,245
Well then, let's get to it!

232
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:21,615
Alright. They're planted.

233
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:24,325
Now somepony tell the truth!

234
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:38,845
Somepony! Anypony!

235
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,755
Yesterday I told Mrs. Cake
that I ate two corn cakes...

236
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,185
...but I really ate three!

237
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,305
Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes!

238
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:03,015
Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!!!

239
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:07,195
Oh, I can't stand it anymore!

240
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:12,135
It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn
my cutie mark! They're all fake!

241
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:21,795
I figured the heart's desire would
help me get what I wanted most...

242
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:25,845
...so when Zecora left her hut,
I mixed up a special potion...

243
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:27,975
...and put the rest
of the heart's desire in it!

244
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:36,125
Whoa...

245
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:48,395
Apple Bloom!

246
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,695
Are you okay?

247
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:53,715
I'm great. And I've never been
happier to be a blank flank.

248
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:58,025
But I'm awful sorry I lied.
Especially to you, girls.

249
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:02,245
I was so desperate for my cutie mark,
I just got carried away.

250
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:06,315
And I'm really sorry I snuck those
flowers from you, Zecora.

251
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:10,065
Why, I wouldn't blame you if you
never wanted me to come by again.

252
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:13,015
Now, Apple Bloom. Do not be silly.

253
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:15,465
You are always welcome, my little filly.

254
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:21,455
With each mistake you learn something new,
growing up into a better you.

255
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:27,245
Apple Bloom, would you mind
writing to Princess Celestia...

256
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:28,755
...and telling her what you learned?

257
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:31,565
I'd be happy to, Twilight. Spike!

258
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:32,735
Ready!

259
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:35,555
"Dear Princess Celestia."

260
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:38,615
"Waiting for what your heart
desires can be really hard."

261
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,755
"So you may try to take a shortcut."

262
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:45,485
"But this dishonesty never works, because
you didn't earn what your heart desires."

263
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:48,685
"The only cure is being honest
with yourself and others."

264
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:51,365
"And that's something
every heart desires."

265
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,695
I sure am proud of you, sis.

266
00:20:56,695 --> 00:21:00,015
Seems like you've finally learned
the importance of patience.

267
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:03,575
Yep! All good things
come to those who wait.

268
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,055
Well, I've waited long enough.

269
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,025
Actually, that was way too long.

270
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:12,625
What?

271
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,525
So what are we gonna do today
to earn our cutie marks?

272
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:17,305
Well, I was thinking.

273
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:19,585
For a pony, who's never
mixed up a potion before...

274
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:21,725
...you sure stirred up something fierce.

275
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:24,565
Yeah! So what if your talent
is potion making?

276
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:28,955
Oh my gosh! Totally!
Let's go talk to Zecora! Now!

277
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,355
-Yeah!
-Woohoo!

278
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:36,845
