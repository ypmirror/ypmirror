1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,060
Come on, Twilight.
You can do it.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,760
Okay. Here goes.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,300
Ha ha! You did it!

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,030
Growing magic --
That's number 25.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,690
25 different types of tricks
and counting.

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,810
And I think this is
the best trick so far.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,620
Hello, Rarity.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,600
What's that?

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,170
Oh, it's nothing --
Just my awesome mustache.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,170
Sorry, romeo.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,230
As attractive and enticing
as you look,

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,610
It's just for practice,
and it's got to go.

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,530
Wait!

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,850
Aw. Rats.

00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,390
25, Twilight --

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,840
25 different kinds of tricks
and counting.

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,100
I thought unicorns were only
supposed to have a little magic

19
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,900
That matches
their special talents.

20
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,970
True --
For ponies whose talents

21
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,270
Are for things like cooking
or singing or math,

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,480
But what if a unicorn's
special talent is magic?

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,390
Like you, Twilight,
and you know a ton of magic.

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,210
Oh, Spike, stop.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,710
I'm sure there are lots of
ponies right here in Ponyville

26
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,410
That know
just as much magic as me.

27
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,400
Are you kidding?

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,730
I don't think there's another
unicorn in all of Equestria

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,300
With your kind of ability,
Twilight.

30
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,900
Gangway!

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,690
Coming through!

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,480
Ugh!

33
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,190
Snips, snails,
wh-What's going on?

34
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,140
Well,
haven't you heard?

35
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,980
There is a new unicorn
in town!

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,560
Yeah!

37
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,700
They say that she's got
more magical powers

38
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,080
Than any other unicorn
ever!

39
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,340
Really?

40
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,970
Aw, no way.

41
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,600
That honor goes
to Twilight here.

42
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,260
Where is this unicorn?

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,290
Oh, she's
in the town square.

44
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,300
Come on!

45
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,950
Yeah! Come on!

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,730
Ooh!

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,010
Come one! Come all!

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,770
Come and witness
the amazing magic

49
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,020
Of the Great and Powerful
Trixie!

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,290
Watch in awe
as the Great and Powerful Trixie

51
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,160
Performs the most spectacular
feats of magic

52
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,080
Ever witnessed by pony eyes!

53
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,450
My, my, my.
What boasting.

54
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,760
Come on.

55
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,630
No pony's as magical as twi--
Twi-- Twi-- Ohh!

56
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,660
H-Hey, Rarity, I, uh --

57
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,050
Mustache!

58
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,770
There's nothing wrong
with being talented, is there?

59
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,980
Nothing at all,

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,160
Excepting when someone
goes around showing it off

61
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,510
Like a school filly
with fancy new ribbons.

62
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,430
Just because one has the ability
to perform lots of magic

63
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,480
Does not make one better
than the rest of us.

64
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,690
Especially when
you got me around

65
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,040
Being better
than the rest of us.

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
Uh, I mean -- Yeah!

67
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,520
Uh, magic schmagic!
Boo!

68
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,390
Well, well, well.

69
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,690
It seems we have some naysayers
in the audience.

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,740
Who is so ignorant as to
challenge the magical ability

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,350
Of the Great and Powerful
Trixie?

72
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,790
Do they not know
that they're in the presence

73
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,020
Of the most magical unicorn
in all of Equestria?!

74
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,140
Pbht. Just who
does she think she is?

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,460
Yeah! Since we all know
that Twilight here is --

76
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,670
Spike, shh!

77
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,340
What? What's wrong?

78
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,660
You see the way
they reacted to Trixie?

79
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,010
I don't want anyone thinking
I'm a show-Off.

80
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,180
So,
Great and Powerful Trixie,

81
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,480
What makes you think
you're so awesome, anyway?

82
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,510
Why, only
the Great and Powerful Trixie

83
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,090
Has magic strong enough

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,890
To vanquish
the dreaded ursa major!

85
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,440
What?!
No way!

86
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,590
When all hope was lost,

87
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,500
The ponies of puffington
had no one to turn to,

88
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,720
But the Great and Powerful
Trixie stepped in

89
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,560
And, with her awesome magic,
vanquished the ursa major

90
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,340
And sent it back to its cave

91
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,200
Deep within
the Everfree forest!

92
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,860
Aw, sweet!
Sa-Weet!

93
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,120
That settles it.

94
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,920
Trixie truly is
the most talented, most magical,

95
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,710
Most awesome unicorn
in Ponyville.

96
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,210
No!
In all of Equestria!

97
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,130
How do you know?
You didn't see it.

98
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,300
And besides, twi--

99
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,980
It's true, my enthusiastic
little admirers --

100
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,640
Trixie is most certainly
the best in Ponyville.

101
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,980
Don't believe
the Great and Powerful Trixie?

102
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,540
Well, then, I hereby challenge
you, ponyvillians --

103
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,970
Anything you can do,
I can do better.

104
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,580
Any takers?
Anyone? Hmm?

105
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,630
Or is Trixie destined to be

106
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,790
The greatest equine
who has ever lived?!

107
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,190
please!

108
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,400
She's unbearable!

109
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,720
You got to show her
you just got to!

110
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,310
There's no way I'm gonna use
my magic now, Spike,

111
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,520
Especially since --

112
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,290
Hmm.

113
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,650
How about...you?

114
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,990
Well, how about it, hmm?

115
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,780
Is there anything
you can do

116
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,810
That the Great
and Powerful Trixie can't?

117
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,560
I-I...

118
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,770
well, little hayseed?

119
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,620
That's it.

120
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,870
I can't stand
for no more of this.

121
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,150
You show her, A.J.!

122
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,960
Can your magical powers
do this?

123
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,320
Ooh!
Ooh!Ooh!
Ooh!

124
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,050
Whoo-Hoo!
Yeah!

125
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,970
That was great!

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,380
Top that, missy!

127
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,900
Oh, ye of little talent,

128
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,720
Watch and be amazed
at the magic of Trixie.

129
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,850
Whoa!

130
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,420
Ugh!

131
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,490
Whoa!
Yay!

132
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,150
Once again,

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,060
The Great and Powerful Trixie
prevails.

134
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,150
There's no need
to go strutting around

135
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,550
And showing off
like that.

136
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,530
Oh?

137
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,580
That's my job.

138
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,100
They don't call me "Rainbow"
and "Dash" for nothing.

139
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,570
When Trixie is through,

140
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,320
The only thing
they'll call you is "loser."

141
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,010
Whoa! Whoa!

142
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,770
I think i'm...gonna be sick.

143
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,120
Seems like any pony
with a Dash of good sense

144
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,520
Would think twice before
tussling with the great Trixie.

145
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,650
Yah!

146
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,710
What we need is another unicorn
to challenge her,

147
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,120
Someone with some magic
of her own.

148
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,970
Yeah! A unicorn
to show this unicorn who's boss.

149
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,670
A real
unicorn-To-Unicorn tussle.

150
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,290
Uh...

151
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,860
enough.
Enough, all of you.

152
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,130
I take your hint,

153
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,210
But Rarity is above
such nonsense.

154
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,690
Rainbow Dash and Applejack
may behave like ruffians,

155
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,500
But Rarity conducts herself
with beauty and grace.

156
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,630
Ohh!
What's the matter?

157
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,410
Afraid you'll get a hair
out of place

158
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,880
In that rat's nest
you call a mane?

159
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,770
Oh...it...is...on.

160
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,300
You may think you're tough,

161
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,960
With all of your
so-Called powers,

162
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,610
But there is more to magic
than your brutish ways.

163
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,620
A unicorn needs to be
more than just muscle.

164
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,400
A unicorn needs to have style.

165
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,380
A unicorn's not a unicorn
without grace and beauty.

166
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,840
Rarity won't let Trixie
get the best of her.

167
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,280
She's strong.
She's beautiful.

168
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,830
She's --

169
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,120
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!

170
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,140
Quick! I need a mirror!
Get me a mirror!

171
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,470
What did she do to my hair?!

172
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,620
I know she did something
terrible to my hair!

173
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,570
Nothing.

174
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,420
It's fine.

175
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,520
It's gorgeous.

176
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,850
It's green.

177
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,450
What?

178
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,840
No. Green hair?!

179
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,630
Not green hair!

180
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,820
Such an awful, awful color!
Aah!

181
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,490
Well! I never!

182
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,200
Well, Twilight,
guess it's up to you.

183
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,910
Come on.
Show her what you're made of.

184
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,690
What do you mean?
I'm nothing special.

185
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,970
Yes, you are.
You're better than her.

186
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,610
I'm not better than anyone.

187
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,620
Ha! You think you're better

188
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,510
Than the Great and Powerful
Trixie?

189
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,930
You think you have
more magical talent?

190
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,850
Well, come on.
Show Trixie what you've got.

191
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,370
Show us all.

192
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,870
Who, me?

193
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm just your run-Of-The-Mill
citizen of Ponyville --

194
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,310
No powerful magic here.

195
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,820
I, uh -- I think
I hear my laundry calling.

196
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,110
Sorry. Got to go.

197
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,110
Twilight?

198
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,940
Once again,
the Great and Powerful Trixie

199
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,420
Has proven herself to be

200
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,580
The most amazing unicorn
in all of Equestria.

201
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,310
Unh.
Was there ever any doubt?

202
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,970
Here's the oat smoothie
you asked for --

203
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,240
With extra hay,
just how you like it.

204
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,620
Mmm. Hay.

205
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,140
Yes?

206
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,090
Oh, tell us another story,
Great and Powerful Trixie.

207
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,020
Yeah, tell us about how
you vanquished the ursa major.

208
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,670
Trixie is far too exhausted

209
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,230
From performing feats
beyond imagination.

210
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,060
Be gone with you
until morning.

211
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,290
Oh, of course,
Great and Powerful Trixie.

212
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,350
Anything you say.

213
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,720
We are at
your beck and call.

214
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,130
What are two doing?

215
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,760
Just bringing
the G&PT a --

216
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,640
The what?

217
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,850
The Great
and Powerful Trixie.

218
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,050
Sheesh!

219
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,890
Just bringing her
a smoothie.

220
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,250
How can you fall
for her lameness?

221
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,590
She's just a show-Off,

222
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,890
Unlike Twilight, who --

223
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,370
The Great and Powerful Trixie
vanquished an ursa major.

224
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,240
Can your Twilight
claim that?

225
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,700
Oh, really?

226
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,570
Were you guys
actually there?

227
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,490
Well, uh, uh...
no, but --

228
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,340
But nothing.

229
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,820
The proof
is in the pudding.

230
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,620
I like pudding.

231
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,830
Look, unless an ursa major
comes waltzing up the street

232
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,900
For Trixie to vanquish,

233
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,020
I am not gonna believe
a word she says,

234
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,270
And neither should you.

235
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,640
Hmm.

236
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,890
An ursa walking
up the street, eh?

237
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,630
Snails, you thinking
what I'm thinking?

238
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,350
Why is it
they call it a flea market

239
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,590
When they don't
really sell fleas?

240
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,560
Yeah! Uh...

241
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,120
oh, come on.

242
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,510
Twilight, would you put down
that book

243
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,600
And just listen to me?

244
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,430
Didn't you see how they hated
Trixie's bragging, Spike?

245
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,300
If I go out there
and show off my magic,

246
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,390
I run the risk
of losing them as friends.

247
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,310
It's not the same thing,
Twilight.

248
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,990
You'd be using your magic
to stand up for your friends.

249
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,310
No, Spike,
it's exactly the same.

250
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,210
Come on, Twilight.

251
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,140
Any one of these tricks,
even the teeniest,

252
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,600
Would be enough
to show up Trixie.

253
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,930
I don't want to be seen
as a bragger like Trixie.

254
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,460
Unh!
But you're the best!

255
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,830
Ugh! Please, Spike.
I said no.

256
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,320
If that's the way
you want to be, then fine.

257
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,190
Whoa!

258
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,010
How we gonna find
an ursa major

259
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,910
When I can't even see
my own hoof in front of my face?

260
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,350
Hold on.

261
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,130
ohh!

262
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,190
Oh. Heh.
That's better.

263
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,490
Aah!
Aah!

264
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,510
Aah! Ha ha ha!

265
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,040
Hey, guys,
where you going?

266
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,070
Can't talk now!

267
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,630
Got a major problem!

268
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,740
Yep!
Ursa major, to be exact!

269
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,290
Trixie!
Trixie!

270
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,410
Twilight!

271
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,660
Trixie!
Trixie!

272
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,490
Come on out!

273
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,130
Trixie!
You got to help!

274
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,070
Trixie thought she said

275
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,960
The Great and Powerful Trixie
did not want to be disturbed.

276
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,650
Uh, w-We --
We have a tiny problem.

277
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,280
Actually,
it's a big one.

278
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,010
What is so important that
you cannot wait until morning

279
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,030
To disturb Trixie?

280
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,370
Aaaaaaah!

281
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,370
Aah!
Aah!

282
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,940
Twilight,
you've got to come quick!

283
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
I've already told you,
Spike --

284
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,840
I don't want to
show up Trixie.

285
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,650
No, you don't understand.
It's --

286
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
Uh, is that
what I think it is?

287
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,470
Majorly.

288
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,700
Great and Powerful Trixie,

289
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,590
You've got to vanquish
the ursa.

290
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,320
Yeah! Vanquish
so we can watch.

291
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,230
It took a lot of trouble
to get that thing here.

292
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,850
Wait.
You brought this here?

293
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,530
are you out
of your little pony minds?!

294
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,810
But you're the great
and powerful Trixie.

295
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,650
Yeah. Remember?
You defeated an ursa major.

296
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,760
Uh, okay.

297
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,700
Stand back.

298
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,510
Ahh. Piece of cake.

299
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,490
Aw, come on, Trixie.

300
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,290
Stop goofing around
and vanquish it, eh?

301
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,190
Well, that was a dud.

302
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,900
Yeah, pbht!
Come on!

303
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,850
Where's all the cool explosions
and smoke and stuff

304
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,940
Like earlier, you know?

305
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,010
Uh-Oh.

306
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,120
Aah!

307
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,960
What's going on?

308
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,450
We brought an ursa
to town.

309
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,940
You what?!

310
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,980
Don't worry.

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,510
The Great and Powerful Trixie
will vanquish it.

312
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,760
I can't.

313
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,210
What?!
What?!

314
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,600
I can't.
I never have.

315
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,180
No one can vanquish
an ursa major.

316
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,440
I just made the whole story up
to make me look better.

317
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,330
Made it up?!
Made it up?!

318
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,110
Mnh!

319
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,180
Nice use of number 16.

320
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,300
Unnnnh!

321
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,160
Golly. Don't ya know?

322
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,680
That's new.

323
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,450
Unnnnnh!

324
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,310
Uhh.

325
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,030
That was amazing!

326
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,960
Heavens to betsy!

327
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,470
We knew you had ability,
but not that much.

328
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,880
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,790
Please, please don't hate me.

330
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,310
Hate you?!
Hate you?!
Hate you?!

331
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,650
Why, whatever do you mean,
darling?

332
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,600
Well, I know how much
you all hated

333
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,180
Trixie's showing off
with her magic tricks,

334
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,000
And I just thought --

335
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

336
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,090
Magic's got nothing
to do with it.

337
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,100
Trixie's
just a loudmouth.

338
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,740
Most unpleasant.

339
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,370
All hat
and no cattle.

340
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,500
So...you don't mind
my magic tricks?

341
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,460
Your magic is a part
of who you are, sugar cube,

342
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,050
And we like who you are.

343
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,560
We're proud to have such
a powerful, talented unicorn

344
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,500
As our friend.

345
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,290
And after whupping
that ursa's hindquarters,

346
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,710
We're even prouder.

347
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,050
You are?

348
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,770
Uh-Huh.
Mm-Hmm.
Mm-Hmm.

349
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,530
Wow, Twilight!

350
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,510
How'd you know what to do
with that ursa major?

351
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,090
That's what I was doing
when you came looking for me.

352
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,110
I was so intrigued
by Trixie's bragging

353
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,240
That I was compelled to do
a little reading up on them.

354
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,130
So, it is possible
to vanquish an ursa major

355
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,080
All by yourself?

356
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,500
That wasn't an ursa major.

357
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,570
It was a baby,
an ursa minor.

358
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,110
That was just a baby?

359
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,650
And it wasn't rampaging.

360
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,510
It was just cranky
because someone woke it up.

361
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,420
Ohh.
Ohh.

362
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,990
Well, if that was
an ursa minor,

363
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,900
Then what's
an ursa major like?

364
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,950
You don't want to know.

365
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,260
Ha! You may have vanquished
an ursa minor,

366
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,750
But you will never have the
amazing, showstopping ability

367
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,250
Of the Great and Powerful
Trixie!

368
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,650
Why, that little...

369
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,360
Just let her go.

370
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
Maybe someday
she'll learn her lesson.

371
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,210
Now, about you two.

372
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,650
Uh...

373
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,740
We're sorry
that we woke up the ursa minor.

374
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,850
We just wanted to see
some awesome magic.

375
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,590
Yeah!

376
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,740
And the way you vanquished
that ursa minor was awesome!

377
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,810
We deserve
whatever punishment you give us.

378
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,780
For starters,
you can clean up this mess.

379
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,620
And...
what do you think, Spike?

380
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,840
Should I give them
number 25?

381
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,930
Oh, 25? Yes.

382
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,980
And I think
I deserve it, too.

383
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,290
Huh?!
Huh?!

384
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,350
I think you're right.

385
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,100
Sweet!
Sweet!
Sweet!

386
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,990
Dear princess Celestia,

387
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,600
I have learned a very valuable
lesson about friendship.

388
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,240
I was so afraid of
being thought of as a show-Off

389
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,610
That I was hiding a part
of who I am.

390
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,050
Hy friends helped me realize

391
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,200
That it's okay to be proud
of your talents

392
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,060
And there are times when it's
appropriate to show them off,

393
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,540
Especially when you're
standing up for your friends.

394
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,250
So, you finally admit

395
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,010
That you're the most talented
unicorn in all of Ponyville?

396
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,130
Well...

397
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,070
yeah.

398
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,090
But it's nothing
to brag about.

399
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,530
So, uh, how did it go
with Rarity?

400
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,660
Eh, she didn't go
for the mustache.

401
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,970
You know, Spike,

402
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,000
That mustache has nothing to do
with who you really are.

403
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,250
Maybe you should just try
being yourself.

404
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,760
Or...maybe the mustache
wasn't enough.

405
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,930
Maybe if I had a mustache
and a beard.

406
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,580
Oh, not this again.

407
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,110
Okay, imagine me with
a nice long fu manchu-Type beard

408
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,120
Or maybe a goatee.

409
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,820
Oh, no --
A soul patch...
