1
00:00:02,825 --> 00:00:04,535
I want to start our field trip here...

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:07,665
...in the world famous
Canterlot Sculpture Garden.

3
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:11,545
That one over there
represents friendship.

4
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:15,655
All right, my little ponies!

5
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:17,585
This one represents victory.

6
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:20,345
How cool would it be to have
*that* for a cutie mark!

7
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:21,975
Cool!

8
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:25,435
If you were actually
victoryful at somethin'.

9
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,185
That's not a word!

10
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:29,275
What are you? A dictionary?

11
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:30,245
Girls!

12
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:33,845
Now this is a really interesting statue.

13
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:36,235
What do you notice about it?

14
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,035
It's got an eagle claw!

15
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:40,655
-And a lion paw!
-And a snake tail!

16
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,435
This creature is called a draconequus.

17
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:47,235
He is the head of a pony and a body
made up of all sorts of things.

18
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,455
What do you suppose that represents?

19
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:52,415
-Confusion!
-Evil!
-Chaos!

20
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:54,645
It's not chaos, you dodo!

21
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:57,005
Don't call me things
I don't know the meaning of!

22
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:58,785
And it is too chaos!

23
00:00:58,785 --> 00:00:59,995
Is not!

24
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,755
You're both wrong!

25
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:12,735
Actually, in a way you're all right.

26
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,805
This statue represents discord...

27
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:18,685
...which means a lack of
harmony between ponies.

28
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:22,185
In fact, you three have
demonstrated discord so well...

29
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:25,855
...that you're each going to
write me an essay explaining it.

30
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:30,485
Now let's go. And I don't
want any more fighting.

31
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:34,005
-It's confusion!
-Evil!
-Chaos!

32
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:20,625
Come back here, you!

33
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:23,395
Gotcha!

34
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:26,095
Eeew! What is this?

35
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,875
Cotton candy?

36
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:40,195
Wait a second! It's not supposed
to rain until tomorrow!

37
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,775
You can't just...!

38
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:44,505
You did.

39
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:50,105
Hey! I didn't tell you to go anywhere!

40
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:53,195
Rainbow Dash! What's
going on with that rain?

41
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:54,565
I mean... chocolate milk?

42
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:56,585
I mean... chocolate milk rain?!

43
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,035
There's crazy weather
all over Equestria!

44
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:01,975
Cloudsdale's getting soaked
by a major cola storm right now.

45
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:05,855
But don't worry. I'm not leaving you,
till I get control of Ponyville.

46
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,895
Why would you wanna stop *this*?

47
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:15,755
I heard about your
troubles, Applejack...

48
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:17,465
...and I came to see if
there's anything I could do.

49
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:19,555
Without getting wet. Or dirty.

50
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:21,435
Or out from under my umbrella.

51
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,355
Fluttershy! Do somethin'!

52
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:33,705
Now Angel, you really shouldn't...

53
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,065
No! It's not possible!

54
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,305
I must be seeing things!

55
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:44,145
Don't worry, everyone! I've learned
a new spell that'll fix everything.

56
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:58,925
My fail-safe spell...

57
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,135
...failed! What do we do?

58
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:02,345
Uh... Give up?

59
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:05,505
Spike. Twilight will
come up with something.

60
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:08,605
Time for Plan B.

61
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:12,335
Rainbow! Can you corral all those
clouds in one corner of the sky?

62
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:22,995
Applejack! I need you to bring those
high strong storm clouds down to earth.

63
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:33,065
Hey! What happened?

64
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:40,295
Oh dear! I hope that none
of the animals see these...

65
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:43,055
...delicious chocolate-filled
cotton candy clouds.

66
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:45,755
I'd hate to have to share them.

67
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:48,555
You and me both, sister!

68
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:50,765
Hey!

69
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:56,315
And when y'all are done that, feel free
to have some popcorn for dessert.

70
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,015
You see, Spike? You
should never give up.

71
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:02,565
There's nothing we can't
overcome if we all work together.

72
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:12,195
Come on, girls! Princess Celestia wants
to see us all in Canterlot immediately!

73
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:23,855
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

74
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:27,335
Thank you, Twilight. Thank you all.

75
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,575
Is this about the weather?
And the animals' weird behavior?

76
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:32,725
What's happening out there? Why
isn't my magic working? Is there...?

77
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:34,535
Follow me.

78
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,585
I've called you here
for a matter of great importance.

79
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,845
It seems an old foe of mine...

80
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:43,125
...someone I thought I had
defeated long ago, has returned.

81
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:46,565
His name is Discord.

82
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:50,525
Discord is the mischievous
spirit of disharmony.

83
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,705
Before my sister and I
stood up to him...

84
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:56,865
...he ruled Equestria in an eternal state
of unrest and unhappiness.

85
00:05:56,865 --> 00:06:00,175
Luna and I saw how miserable
life was for earth ponies...

86
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,245
...pegasi and unicorns alike.

87
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,665
So after discovering
the Elements of Harmony...

88
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,955
...we combined our powers
and rose up against him...

89
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,695
...turning him to stone.

90
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,525
Alright, princess!

91
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:14,365
I thought the spell we cast would
keep him contained forever...

92
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:17,245
...but since Luna and I are
no longer connected to the Elements...

93
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:19,305
...the spell has been broken.

94
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,745
No longer connected?

95
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:24,985
This is Canterlot tower, where
the Elements are kept inside...

96
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,245
...since all of you recovered them.

97
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:31,885
I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony
once again and stop Discord...

98
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:35,455
...before he thrusts
all of Equestria into eternal chaos.

99
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:37,405
But why us? Why don't you...?

100
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:39,305
Hey, look! We're famous!

101
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:42,005
You six showed the full
potential of the Elements...

102
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:46,035
...by harnessing the magic of your
friendship to beat a mighty foe.

103
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:48,615
Although Luna and I
once wielded the Elements...

104
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:50,865
...it is you, who now control their power.

105
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:53,675
And it is you, who must defeat Discord!

106
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:59,775
Princess Celestia, you can count on...

107
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:01,045
Hold on a second!

108
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,695
Eternal chaos comes with
chocolate rain, you guys!

109
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:06,505
CHOCOLATE RAIN!

110
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:08,565
Don't listen to her, princess.

111
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:11,335
We'd be honored to use
the Elements of Harmony again.

112
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:29,915
You can keep the Elements.
I'll take that case.

113
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,685
Have no fear, ponies.

114
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:35,215
I have total confidence that you
will be able to defeat Discord...

115
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:36,765
...with these.

116
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:43,985
Oh well. If anyone needs me...

117
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:48,175
...I'll be outside in the chocolate
puddles with a giant swizzle straw.

118
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,035
The Elements! They're gone!

119
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:55,285
That chamber is protected by
a powerful spell that only I can break.

120
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,305
This doesn't make sense...

121
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:03,755
"Make sense"? Oh, what fun
is there in making sense?

122
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:05,945
Discord! Show yourself!

123
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:12,065
Did you miss me, Celestia?

124
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,955
I've missed you.

125
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:19,505
It's quite lonely being encased in stone.
But you wouldn't know that, would you?

126
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:23,245
Because I don't turn ponies into stone!

127
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,875
Enough! What have you done
with the Elements of Harmony?

128
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,205
Well, I just borrowed them
for a teensy little while.

129
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,095
You'll never get away
with this, Discord!

130
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,035
Oh, I'd forgotten how grim
you can be, Celestia.

131
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,555
It's really quite boring.

132
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,055
Hey! Nopony insults the princess!

133
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:49,785
Oh! You must be Rainbow Dash...

134
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,285
...famed for her loyalty ‒ the Element
of Harmony you represent.

135
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,395
That's right! I'll always
be loyal to the princess!

136
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:58,245
We'll see about that.

137
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:01,775
I can't believe we're wasting our time
talking to a tacky window.

138
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,595
The beautiful Rarity, representing
the Element of Generosity...

139
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,445
...if I'm not mistaken.

140
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:09,955
So you know who we are. Big deal.

141
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,935
Oh, I know much more than
that, honest Applejack.

142
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:15,095
You seem to know our strengths too.

143
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,235
Yes, Twilight Sparkle.

144
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:21,255
And yours is the most powerful
and elusive element ‒ magic.

145
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:25,655
Fluttershy's is kindness and Pinkie Pie's
is the personal favorite of mine...

146
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,145
...laughter!

147
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:28,645
Pinkie!

148
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,785
He's standing on your head!

149
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,505
Stop stalling, Discord!

150
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,795
What have you done with
the Elements of Harmony?

151
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:40,125
Oh! So boring, Celestia. Really.

152
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,935
Fine. I'll tell you, but
I'll only tell you my way.

153
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:49,285
To retrieve your missing elements
just make sense of this change of events.

154
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:52,285
Twists and turns are my master plan...

155
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:55,705
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

156
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:59,425
Can we go home now?

157
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:01,095
What do you reckon he meant?

158
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:03,565
"Twists and turns" and then
the "back where we started".

159
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:04,995
Twists and turns...

160
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,955
Twists and turns...

161
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,765
Twists and turns! That's it!

162
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:12,775
I bet Discord hid the Elements
in the palace labyrinth!

163
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:15,205
Good luck, my little ponies.

164
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:18,875
The fate of Equestria is in your hooves.

165
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,285
Thanks, princess. We won't let you down.

166
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:30,915
We... We have to go in there?

167
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:34,985
Nope! Dopey Discord
forgot about these babies!

168
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:38,375
I'll just do a quick flyover and
we'll have the Elements in no time.

169
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:43,715
My wings!

170
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,235
Your horn!

171
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:48,385
My horn!

172
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:03,195
You... You should see the looks
on your faces. Priceless!

173
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:06,075
Give us our wings and horns back!

174
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,815
You'll get them back in good time.

175
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:10,195
I simply took them to ensure
there's no cheating.

176
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:12,895
You see, this is the first
rule of our game:

177
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:16,375
No flying and no magic.

178
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:18,985
The first rule?

179
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:22,925
The second rule is: everypony has to play
or the game is over.

180
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,075
And I win.

181
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,015
Good luck, everypony!

182
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:34,285
Never fear, girls. We have each other.

183
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:36,545
Yeah! Like Twilight said.

184
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:40,185
There's nothing we can't overcome
if we all stick together.

185
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:43,185
All right, girls! Let's do this.

186
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,515
Together!

187
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:51,015
Stay calm, girls!

188
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:54,415
Everypony head to the middle as fast as
you can and we'll regroup there.

189
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:56,845
-Moving out!
-See you in the center.

190
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:59,105
-Yeehaw!
-See you guys there!

191
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,185
What's that?! Who's there?! GIIIRLS!

192
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:20,065
What in tarnation?

193
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:26,945
Where am I?

194
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,135
Who are y'all?

195
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:41,115
The keepers of the grove of truth.

196
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,745
You may ask us...

197
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,975
...a one question:

198
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:47,395
Past, future or present.

199
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:48,945
But be warned...

200
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:50,505
...that the truth...

201
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,875
...may not always be pleasant.

202
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:56,375
Alright then. I don't trust
this place for the hill a' beans...

203
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,445
...but I got a real bad feelin'
about this feller Discord.

204
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,765
What's gonna come of this
here mission we're on?

205
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:07,535
For the answer you seek...

206
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:10,705
...go ahead! Take a peek.

207
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,515
I hope I'll never see you again!

208
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:16,635
Me too!

209
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:18,495
-Fine!
-Fine!

210
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,195
It's settled then.

211
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:25,955
No!

212
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:28,195
Our friendship... over?

213
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:37,255
It can't be true. It just can't!

214
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:43,755
That just can't be the truth.

215
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,945
When all the truth does...

216
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:48,215
...is make your heart ache...

217
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:52,405
...sometimes a lie is easier to take.

218
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:02,275
Applejack! Thank goodness.
I thought I heard voices over here.

219
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:03,985
Who were you talking to?

220
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:06,245
I was talkin' to, uh...

221
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,075
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

222
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:11,845
What?

223
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:12,995
Nothin'.

224
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:15,365
Come on. Uh, we best be goin'.

225
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:17,995
Did Applejack just...

226
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:21,655
Come on, Twilight.
Applejack wouldn't lie.

227
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,635
This is the greatest
balloon garden I've ever seen!

228
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:40,695
It's the first balloon garden
I've ever seen, but still...

229
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:48,995
Hey! What gives?

230
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:53,375
What's the matter, Pinkie Pie?
I thought you appreciated a good laugh.

231
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,295
It's different. They're
laughing *at* me.

232
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,535
It's hardly different.

233
00:14:58,535 --> 00:15:01,115
Your friends laugh at you all the time.

234
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:03,605
My friends laugh *with* me, not at me.

235
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,375
Oh, really?

236
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:13,435
No! Stop it!

237
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:23,345
Stop laughing at me!

238
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:26,875
Oh, poor Pinkie Pie.

239
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,385
And here I thought
laughter made you happy.

240
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:33,575
Happy?

241
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:36,505
I don't think so.

242
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:42,615
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

243
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:46,205
You are, huh? WHY? Need a good laugh?

244
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:47,305
Pinkie?

245
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:52,055
What do you suppose has her
so upset? It's not like her.

246
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,555
I didn't notice anythin'
strange about Pinkie.

247
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,465
Weird. Better pick up
the pace before...

248
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:00,585
...the stress of this gets
the better of all of us.

249
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:09,435
I was expecting an audience with
the princess, not outdoor sport.

250
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:11,805
Oh my.

251
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:20,265
Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity.

252
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:25,435
You've found the one thing in Equestria
that could rival my face for sheer beauty.

253
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,765
What do you think? You like?

254
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:34,435
Yes... I like very much.

255
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:41,375
NO! No. I shan't succumb
to such fabulousness.

256
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,975
Must... get to the center...
to meet... the others...

257
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,385
MINE!!!

258
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:54,055
Well, Rarity...

259
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:56,485
It took forever, but it was worth it.

260
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,105
Who knew three little gemstones
would turn out to be...

261
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,845
...this handsome HUNK of a diamond?

262
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:07,035
Now to get you home.

263
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:17,425
Rarity! Are we glad to see...

264
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,935
Why are you carrying
a humongous boulder?

265
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:22,215
What do you mean "boulder"?

266
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:26,465
This big, beautiful, bedazzling
rock is a DIAMOND!

267
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,595
And it's all mine.

268
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:30,765
Keep your envious little eyes off it!

269
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:33,695
I found it and it's mine,
fair and square!

270
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:47,845
Okay, I can do this. I can...

271
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:51,295
Oh! Wait a minute!

272
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:54,535
Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!

273
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,575
Fluttershy.

274
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:06,305
Looks like you've been left behind
by your so-called friends, huh?

275
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:10,965
Oh, no. I'm certain they're
doing their best to find me.

276
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:15,785
Well, it must be so upsetting to know how
weak and helpless they think you are.

277
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,945
Not at all!

278
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:20,525
I *am* weak and helpless and
I appreciate their understanding.

279
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:23,565
Yes, well... surely it
burns you up, I mean...

280
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:27,145
...that they're always
pointing out your flaws, right?

281
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,415
Not really. In fact...

282
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:33,585
I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends
who want me to be the best I can be.

283
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,535
Oh, for goodness's sake!

284
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,095
You've been kind for
far too long, my dear.

285
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:41,095
Time to be cruel!

286
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:43,255
Arrivederci!

287
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:49,165
Fluttershy! I'm so glad
to see your friendly face.

288
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:51,665
This awful labyrinth is
getting to everypony.

289
00:18:53,435 --> 00:18:55,825
Oh, boo hoo hoo!

290
00:18:56,945 --> 00:19:00,355
Why don't you wave your magic little
horn and make everything all right?

291
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:05,015
Oh, that's right. You can't.
You don't have one.

292
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:09,675
What is happening to my friends?

293
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:12,055
And what are YOU laughing at?!

294
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:13,245
Chocolate milk!

295
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,655
Little help here?

296
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:18,265
Thanks, Twilight.

297
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:21,135
-You're welcome...
-But don't get any ideas about my gem!

298
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:23,615
I know where you live.

299
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:35,885
I've got you now, Element.

300
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:44,945
I can see why you like these
clouds so much. Very plush.

301
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:48,145
Get off there and put 'em up!
C'mon, let's go!

302
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,095
Hey, I'm here to deliver a message.

303
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:52,955
I've got a message for you too!

304
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,805
Listen closely. This is important.

305
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:59,865
A weighty choice is yours to make ‒
The right selection or a big mistake.

306
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,795
If the wrong choice
you choose to pursue...

307
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:05,795
...the foundations of home
will crumble without you.

308
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:13,935
Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me...

309
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,195
NO!!!

310
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:21,095
That box contains your wings.
You can take them and leave the game...

311
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:26,165
...or you can carry on aimlessly
wandering this maze. Your choice.

312
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,745
Must... find... Rainbow Dash...

313
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:40,285
As a team... we're unstoppable.

314
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:43,215
Rainbow Dash won't let us down.

315
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:44,835
Well, lookie there.

316
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:48,205
Rainbow Dash is flyin' away.
She's abandonin' us.

317
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:50,265
Now I know that's a lie.

318
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:52,425
