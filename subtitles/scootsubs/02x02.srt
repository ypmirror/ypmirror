1
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:08,625
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

2
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:13,275
I need you to wield the Elements
of Harmony once again and stop Discord.

3
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:15,065
The Elements! They're gone!

4
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:19,635
Everypony has to play
or the game is over.

5
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,685
And I win.

6
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:24,055
Our friendship... over?

7
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:25,325
Who were you talking to?

8
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,085
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

9
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:29,085
What?

10
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:31,685
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

11
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:34,185
WHY? Need a good laugh?

12
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:37,125
What is happening to my friends?

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:43,105
Looks like we might be due
for a big old storm of chaos.

14
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,265
And what are YOU laughing at?!

15
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:35,095
You ponies are just
the most fun I've had in aeons.

16
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,375
Well, QUIT IT!!!

17
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,965
You'd better think
before you laugh at the Pink!

18
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,335
...kie Pie!

19
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:43,465
Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:45,065
Well, ha ha.

21
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:45,765
Quit it!

22
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:47,875
No. Ha ha.

23
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,105
QUIT IT!!!

24
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:52,235
No. Ha ha ha ha ha.

25
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:53,595
Uh, Rarity?

26
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:54,895
This here diamond o' yours?

27
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:58,725
Twilight said we should split it
six way, since we, uh...

28
00:01:58,725 --> 00:01:59,945
...found it together.

29
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:04,135
Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine!

30
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:07,045
Girls, why are you
all acting like this?

31
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,895
We need to stick together!

32
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:11,935
It's just too entertaining.

33
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,025
Stop it, Discord!
You're not playing fair.

34
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:18,375
I'm not playing fair?
Perhaps we haven't met.

35
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:22,485
I'm Discord. Spirit of chaos
and disharmony.

36
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:24,155
Hellooo!

37
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:26,425
How are we supposed to find
the Elements of Harmony...

38
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,505
...when you took away the labyrinth
before we could get to the end?!

39
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,155
Oh, wait! Did you...?

40
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,205
How funny!

41
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:36,355
You thought the Elements
were *in* the labyrinth?

42
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:43,255
Twists and turns are my master plan...

43
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:46,885
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

44
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,795
I never said they
were in the labyrinth.

45
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:53,065
But... But...

46
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:55,135
Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle.

47
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:58,325
♥ Maybe the magic of friendship ♥
can help you.

48
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:01,875
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some chaos to wreak.

49
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,745
Chocolate milk?! I hate chocolate milk!

50
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:13,325
Think, Twilight, think!

51
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,925
Find the Elements
back where you began...

52
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,645
Back where you began...

53
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:19,225
Don't touch my gem!

54
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:22,065
I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha ha.

55
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:23,555
What's you laughing at?!

56
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:25,965
Ugh, I just wanna go home.

57
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,365
Wait a minute...

58
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,725
Home! Back where you began!

59
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:32,455
The Elements must be in...

60
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:34,175
...Ponyville!

61
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,135
Come on, girls! I'm certain this is
what Discord's riddle really meant.

62
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,835
If we get back to the library...

63
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,425
...I have a book that I just know
can give us a clue.

64
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:50,245
Good boy, Angel! Mama's so proud.

65
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,795
Weeell, I can see so much better now.

66
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:02,705
I meant to do that.

67
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:10,075
Discord's turned our
dirt roads into soap!

68
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,315
Beautiful, isn't it?

69
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:15,995
This is the new and improved Ponyville.

70
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:19,175
And these are only my first changes.

71
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:23,205
This may look like fun, but it's not.

72
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:30,485
Picture it, the chaos
capital of the world.

73
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:34,925
I can't picture anything.
It's too dark.

74
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,465
Well, wait a few minutes and you'll
see it in the beautiful light of day.

75
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:40,525
Or not.

76
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:45,165
Ponyville the chaos
capital of the world?

77
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,625
Not if I have anything to say about it.

78
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,715
Don't worry. You won't.

79
00:04:56,015 --> 00:05:01,375
Okay, we're here. Everyone please
please please just go inside, please?

80
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,415
I absolutely refuse.

81
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:05,095
With pleasure.

82
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,035
I hate libraries.

83
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:18,755
Pleeease, we gotta hurry!

84
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:21,625
Forget it, Twilight.
I know what you're up to.

85
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:25,905
The second I go in you'll have your
little minion Spike come and take Tom.

86
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:28,885
-Tom?
-Well, it's not going to work!

87
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:33,685
You're not going in
without him, are you?

88
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:37,305
Fine!

89
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,245
What'd you do that for, Fluttershy?

90
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:55,325
Cause you just look so peaceful.

91
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,495
I, uh...

92
00:05:58,145 --> 00:05:59,565
Careful, Twilight!

93
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:01,645
You'll ruin his beautiful finish.

94
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,035
Oh, for the love of...

95
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:04,485
Twilight, what's going on?

96
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:06,115
Why's everybody look so...

97
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,245
...gray?

98
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,825
Don't ask. I need you
to help me find something.

99
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,245
Hey, Twilight? What's
soaking wet and clueless?

100
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:16,655
Fluttershy, I've had just about enou...

101
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:18,715
Your face!

102
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,055
What's happened to everypony?

103
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:24,605
I guess you just bring up
the worst in us, Spike.

104
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:26,705
No time to explain.

105
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:29,025
We've got to find the reference guide
to Elements of Harmony...

106
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:31,935
...before somepony does
something she'll regret!

107
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,005
The Elements of Harmony?

108
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:36,205
Oh! I know exactly where that book is!

109
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:38,985
Found it!

110
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:40,675
Ha!

111
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:44,255
Fluttershy... You better
give me that book!

112
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,185
Keep away!

113
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:47,415
Hey!

114
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,965
Applejack! Give me that book!

115
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:50,405
I don't have any book.

116
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:52,895
Pinkie!

117
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:55,015
You guys!

118
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:57,945
Stop it right now!

119
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,515
Mine!

120
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,805
Hey! Do you even know
what you just stole?

121
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,175
No, but if you want it, I want it.

122
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:11,925
GIVE ME THAT BOOK!!!

123
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:21,525
Where is she? Where is Rarity?

124
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,465
Beats me.

125
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:23,835
Lies!

126
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,525
Get back! All of you!

127
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:36,405
This is my book! AND I'M GONNA READ IT!

128
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:43,595
The Elements!

129
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:49,395
The Elements!

130
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,385
They were here all along!

131
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:52,295
This is great!

132
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:55,285
Now you guys can defeat Discord
and put everything back to normal.

133
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:59,015
See, girls? We did it! We've found
the Elements of Harmony!

134
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:00,415
Together!

135
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:03,795
You don't even care, do you?

136
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:04,755
No.

137
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:08,695
I never thought it would
happen. My friends...

138
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,215
...have turned into complete jerks!

139
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:14,685
Necklace... Necklace...
Necklace... Necklace...

140
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:15,635
Aaand...

141
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:18,785
...big crown-thingy.
Come on, everypony! Let's go!

142
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:21,435
But, Twilight.
Aren't you missing somepony?

143
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,775
Nope. We've got the liar, the grump,
the hoarded and the brute.

144
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:25,825
That just about covers it.

145
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,765
What about Rainbow Dash?

146
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:32,235
Congratulations, Spike. You're
the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!

147
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,765
Me?!

148
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:36,645
B-b-but... what if she finds out
I've been impersonating her?

149
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:38,665
That won't end well.

150
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:40,415
Too bad. You're Rainbow Dash.

151
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:43,835
Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't
ever have to talk to each other again.

152
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:46,435
YEAH! WOOHOO!

153
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:50,605
Move!

154
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,095
Look out! Here comes Tom!

155
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:02,665
Well, well, well. I see you've
found the Elements of Harmony.

156
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:04,905
How terrifying!

157
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:07,775
Discord! I've figured out
your lame riddle.

158
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:09,475
You're in for it now!

159
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:12,815
I certainly am. You've
clearly outduelled me.

160
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:16,315
And now it's time to meet my fate.

161
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:19,515
I'm prepared to be
defeated now, ladies.

162
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:22,065
Fire when ready.

163
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:24,165
Formation! Now!

164
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:29,105
Rainbow Dash! Get over here!

165
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:33,735
All right. Let's get this over with.

166
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:56,245
What's going on?

167
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:59,165
Mine's workin'. There must be
somethin' wrong with yours.

168
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,625
I hate the Elements of Harmony!

169
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:03,335
Garbage.

170
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:05,205
MINE!

171
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:09,185
Sorry, Twilight. I guess I better get
back upstairs and clean up the library.

172
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:11,135
Good luck with all this... whoa!

173
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,405
Oops. Sorry, Rainbow Crash.

174
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:19,665
Bravo, ponies! Bravo!

175
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:23,135
Harmony in Equestria
is officially dead.

176
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,905
Discord rules, Celestia drools.

177
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:32,535
It's your fault it didn't work!

178
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:33,955
Who are you talking to?

179
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:36,015
Any of you! All of you!

180
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,295
I'm outta here!

181
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:41,835
I better go too. I got new, better
friends waitin' for me at the farm.

182
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,845
Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.

183
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,605
Fine! Leave! See if I care.

184
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,515
I don't need you guys either.

185
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,975
With friends like you, who needs...

186
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,355
...enemies.

187
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:20,395
My stomach!

188
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:25,365
Twilight, you've got to
see what I just did.

189
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,295
It's priceless!

190
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:39,805
Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've
got to get into the spirit of things.

191
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:43,315
After all, this is your new home.

192
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,575
Not anymore.

193
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,235
YES!

194
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,245
Pack your things, Spike. We're leaving.

195
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:06,585
And don't ask where we're going,
'cause... I don't know yet.

196
00:12:06,585 --> 00:12:08,045
Just not here.

197
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,215
Can't... move!

198
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:14,875
The Princess...
has been sending these...

199
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:17,845
...since I came back upstairs.

200
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:23,165
Make it stop!

201
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:25,175
These are all the letters
I've written to the Princess...

202
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,145
...since I've lived in Ponyville.

203
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,715
But why would she send them back?

204
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:34,185
"Real friends don't care
what your cover is..."

205
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:36,615
"Friendship is a wondrous
and powerful thing..."

206
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:40,345
"And like the path cut through the orchard,
there'll be always a way through."

207
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,905
"The best thing to do is
to stay true to yourself..."

208
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:45,265
"...special magical connection
with her friends..."

209
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,455
"...maybe even before she's met them."

210
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:50,715
Spike! Spike, it's all so clear!

211
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:55,485
Can't you see? Discord's trying to
distract us from what's important.

212
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,945
He knows how powerful
our friendships are...

213
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,235
...and he's trying to
keep us from seeing it.

214
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:04,065
Do you remember what I said
the first day we arrived in Ponyville?

215
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:07,885
I told you that the future of Equestria
didn't rest on me making friends.

216
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,795
But the opposite is true!

217
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:11,565
The friendships I've made
since I've been here...

218
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:13,625
...would save Equestria
from Nightmare Moon.

219
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,495
And now they need to
save it from Discord!

220
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:19,645
You're right, Spike.

221
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:21,695
I've got to fight for my friendships.

222
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:25,705
For them. For me. For Equestria!

223
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:29,985
Oh. Uh...

224
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,605
Why don't you just stay here and rest?

225
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,855
I'll take care of the whole fighting
for friendship thing myself.

226
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,255
And so I tried to defeat Discord...

227
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:01,315
...but none of my so-called friends
would lift a hoof to help me.

228
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,895
Applejack! I'm here to fight
for our friendship.

229
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,285
Oh. Now you wanna fight.

230
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,665
Where were you when
I was battlin' Discord?

231
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:15,685
Snap out of it!

232
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:17,505
This isn't you!

233
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:19,085
You're not a liar.

234
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:42,585
Wha... What happened?

235
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:43,935
Twilight!

236
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:47,145
I saw a vision of us
feudin' and fightin'.

237
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:50,585
I couldn't face the truth
so I started tellin' lies.

238
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:52,405
Can you ever forgive me?

239
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,015
I already have.

240
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,145
Come on!

241
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,555
Oh no!

242
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:05,275
Twilight! Applejack!
I just had the worst dream!

243
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:10,265
What do you think you're doing?
Get away from my gem! Get Away!

244
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:17,505
Let us never speak of this again.

245
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,435
Oh, and I... I turned gray!

246
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:25,685
Can you believe it?

247
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:28,835
She's not here.

248
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:31,665
Without Rainbow Dash
we can't use the Elements.

249
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:35,065
She could be anywhere by now.
We're never gonna find her.

250
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,205
Yeah, we will. Cause she's right there.

251
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:38,715
Rainbow Dash!

252
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:39,865
Hey, guys!

253
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,025
We've been looking everywhere for you.

254
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:43,375
That's nice.

255
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,145
Discord's still on the loose.

256
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:48,555
We need you to help us defeat him
with your element: loyalty.

257
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:50,945
Loyalty-schmoyalty.

258
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:54,205
Have you guys seen Ponyville?
It's a disaster!

259
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:57,795
I'm staying here in Cloudsdale
where everything is awesome.

260
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:02,395
How in Equestria could she think that
tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?

261
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,915
The same way he got you to think that
cheap rock was a bona fide diamond?

262
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,985
I thought we agreed
never to speak of it again.

263
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:10,845
Time for Plan B.

264
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:19,845
Okay, Fluttershy.

265
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,905
You grab Rainbow Dash
and hold her down.

266
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,865
Applejack will lower me
down from this rope...

267
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:25,715
...so I can cast
the memory spell on her.

268
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:26,865
Got it!

269
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:34,175
Um... I'm just wondering
if it's okay...

270
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,575
...if I hold you down
against your will for a little bit?

271
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:42,275
Nice try. Ponyville's
your problem, not mine.

272
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:47,885
Come on, Fluttershy!
We've gotta catch her.

273
00:16:58,255 --> 00:16:59,275
Applejack!

274
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:11,815
PinkiIEEE! You were supposed
to secure the roOOPE!

275
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:12,915
Oops.

276
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:18,235
Rarity! Pinkie! Hold on!
Y'all are slowin' 'er down!

277
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:22,235
Oh, Fluttershy. Would you
be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?

278
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:24,505
I can't!

279
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:27,295
If you can't catch her, Discord wins!

280
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:31,675
That... big... dumb... MEANIE!!!

281
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:39,015
Okay, Applejack! Last rope!
Make it count!

282
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:54,245
Lemme go! I don't need you guys!

283
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:55,565
Leave me alone!

284
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:08,185
Wha... What happened?

285
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:10,725
How's Ponyville?!
Where are the Elements?!

286
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,635
Did we stop Discord?

287
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:20,805
Maybe it's a little early
for a group hug.

288
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,855
Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.

289
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:39,805
Not as wonderful...

290
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:41,825
...as friendship!

291
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:44,865
This again?

292
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:53,115
That's right! You couldn't break apart
our friendship for long.

293
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,535
Oh, Applejack. Don't lie to me.

294
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,445
I'm the one who made you a liar.

295
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:03,445
Will you ever learn?

296
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:17,655
I'll tell you what
we've learned, Discord.

297
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:20,605
We've learned that
friendship isn't always easy...

298
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,355
...but there's no doubt
it's worth fighting for.

299
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:25,135
Ugh, gag.

300
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,875
Fine. Go ahead.
Try and use your little Elements.

301
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,215
"Friend me". Just make it quick.

302
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:34,565
I'm missing some excellent chaos here.

303
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:38,395
All right, ladies! Let's show him
what friendship can do!

304
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:39,605
Wait, wait, wait!

305
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:00,485
What's this?

306
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:04,065
No...

307
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:14,145
Nooo!!!

308
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:03,705
We are gathered here today...

309
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:08,065
...to once again honor
the heroism of these six friends...

310
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:10,145
...who stood up
to the villain Discord...

311
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,865
...and saved Equestria
from eternal chaos.

312
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:36,795
