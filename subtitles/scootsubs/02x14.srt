1
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:47,675
Applejack, you're sure to knock everypony's
hat off at the Equestria Rodeo competition!

2
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:50,785
Aw shucks, Apple Bloom.
I sure hope so.

3
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,175
Hope so?
I know so!

4
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:57,365
After all, you're the ten-time
rodeo champion of Ponyville!

5
00:00:57,365 --> 00:01:02,015
Why, you got more blue ribbons
than anypony in Ponyville ever!

6
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:06,255
And I can't wait for my big sis' to
win every blue ribbon in Equestria...

7
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:11,625
...and bring home the title of
Equestria Rodeo Champion.

8
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:48,325


9
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:58,225
Now, careful, Derpy!

10
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:01,445
Don't want to do any more damage
than you've already done...

11
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,305
I just don't know what went wrong.

12
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,395
Yeah. It's a mystery.

13
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,745
Nice work, Rainbow Dash.

14
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:30,085
You okay, Rainbow Dash?
Anything I can do to help?

15
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:32,925
No! Nothing!

16
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:36,645
In the name of Celestia,
just sit there and do nothing.

17
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:42,415
Oops. My bad.

18
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:47,585
Applejack!
Applejack!

19
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,525
Everypony, can I get your attention?

20
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:52,025
Attention please!

21
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:55,535
Yes, we are all here to send
Applejack to compete...

22
00:02:55,535 --> 00:03:00,265
...in this year's Equestria Rodeo
competition in Canterlot.

23
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:07,955
And, I want to thank Applejack in advance...

24
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:12,735
...for generously offering up
her prize money to fix town hall.

25
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:16,395
Yeah, Applejack!
Whoohoo!

26
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,025
Speech!
Speech!

27
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,145
Oh, shucks.
I'm not much for speeches.

28
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,195
Alright then, no speech!

29
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:35,175
But, this is the nicest send off
anypony could ask for.

30
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:39,435
Y'all have been cheering me on in every
rodeo since I was a little little pony.

31
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:45,065
So it seems only fittin' to use
my winnings to fix up town hall.

32
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:48,155
I promise to make Ponyville proud.

33
00:03:55,125 --> 00:04:02,405
I want you to show all them high-falutin'
rodeo ponies what a real rodeo pony's like!

34
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:04,095
You betcha, Granny Smith.

35
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,655
And bring back all that money!

36
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,345
You betcha, Mayor.

37
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:10,395
And have fun.
And don't be nervous.

38
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:14,455
Or barf. Use that nervous energy to do
even better than you already would!

39
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,915
And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy
and taffy gives lots of nervous energy!

40
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:24,085
- Just do your best, Applejack.
- I'll do better than my best!

41
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:26,335
The train to Canterlot is about to leave!

42
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,895
All aboard who's coming aboard!

43
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,555
Guess that means me.

44
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:32,055
See ya in a week!

45
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,755
With lots of new blue ribbons!

46
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:35,755
And lots of money!

47
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:37,255
Darn tootin'!

48
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:48,465
See y'all in a week, with a
big bag full of blue ribbons!

49
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,275
And drink sarsaparilla!

50
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,335
What? It gives you extra sass.

51
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:03,975
I hope Applejack is surprised
by this surprise party!

52
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:06,145
Well, that is the point.

53
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:09,905
I know, but I hope she isn't
so surprised she's startled.

54
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,605
Because while being surprised can be nice...

55
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,735
...being startled can be very startling.

56
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,235
Surprise!

57
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:19,555
Oh, Pinkie, you startled me.

58
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:22,465
Sorry! I was just practicing my "surprise!"
for when we surprise Applejack...

59
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:27,765
...with this super cool party for becoming
rodeo champion of Equestria! Surprise!

60
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:30,585
Quiet, Pinkie.
I think Applejack's coming!

61
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:34,225
Don't worry, Twilight.
Got my lips all limbered up!

62
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:51,035
SURPRISE!

63
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,025
Surprise!

64
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,325
Shoot!

65
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,645
Wow, this is the best surprise ever!

66
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:58,645
How did you know it was my birthday?

67
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,845
Who's it from, Twilight?
What's it say?

68
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,245
It's from Applejack.

69
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,495
"Family and friends, not
coming back to Ponyville."

70
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:16,785
"Don't worry, will send money soon."

71
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:18,875
That's all there is.

72
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,955
Applejack's... not comin' back?

73
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:27,005
What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?!

74
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:28,755
She loves Ponyville!

75
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,535
And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!

76
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:34,255
And she loves her family!

77
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:39,205
Something just dreadful must have happened
to Applejack to make her not return!

78
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:42,335
Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!

79
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,995
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's go find her!

80
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:49,305
Don't worry. We'll search all of
Equestria if we have to.

81
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:50,785
We'll bring her back.

82
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,285
Y'all are the best.

83
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:53,885
Thank you, girls!

84
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:02,705
Our little bushel just lost one apple.

85
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:10,405
I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end.

86
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:13,715
I don't wanna go home empty-hooved
after promising we'd find her.

87
00:08:13,715 --> 00:08:16,445
I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.

88
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:18,505
I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!

89
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:21,185
I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!

90
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,795
This is Dodge Junction, girls.

91
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:28,895
Applejack is supposed to have
come here after the rodeo ended.

92
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:34,595
Let's fan out and try to find her.

93
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:36,195
Pickles!

94
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,585
Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry!

95
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,085
Hurry it up in there!

96
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,645
Some ponies. Sheesh.

97
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,775
Applejack!

98
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:51,005
I found her, I found her, I found her,
I found her, I found her!

99
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,385
Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!

100
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:56,985
We're so glad you're safe!

101
00:08:56,985 --> 00:08:59,575
I found her, I found her,
I found her, I found her!

102
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,305
Be right back.

103
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,465
Uh, hey, everypony.

104
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:06,865
What's up?

105
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:08,765
Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!

106
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,925
Yes, why are you here?

107
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:12,335
Are you okay?

108
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,635
Do you have any snacks?

109
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,535
Tell us what happened, Applejack!

110
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:20,085
Applejack? Are these some
of your Ponyville friends?

111
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:21,195
Yes ma'am.

112
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,695
And you are...?

113
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,465
Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee,
boss at Cherry-o Range.

114
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:28,375
Hasn't Applejack told ya?

115
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,445
I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo.

116
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,845
Never saw anypony win so
many ribbons in all my life.

117
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:39,255
Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee.
You don't have to go into all that.

118
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,055
Oh, she's so modest.

119
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:45,275
Anyway, I can always use a pony with
quick hooves and a strong back.

120
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:48,335
So, when I heard Applejack was
looking for a change of scenery...

121
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:52,225
...I snapped her up as quick as I could
and brought her to Dodge Junction.

122
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,725
Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends.

123
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:56,325
See you back at the ranch.

124
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:00,655
"Change of scenery"?
What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:01,995
No big deal, guys.

126
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:04,385
I thought cherries would be
a nice change from apples...

127
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:07,675
...so I took the job and came here.
That's it. End of story.

128
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:10,665
That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!

129
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:12,575
Sorry, but that's all there is to tell.

130
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:15,705
Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now.

131
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:18,725
Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing okay.

132
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:23,825
Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel
all over Equestria searching for you...

133
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:25,325
...to come home without you!

134
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,835
Well I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me!

135
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,655
There is nothin' to tell and I am
not going back to Ponyville!

136
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:36,055
I don't care what she says,
Applejack's not telling us something.

137
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:39,075
Twilight's right. We gotta
get her to spill the beans!

138
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:41,235
What?! She had beans?

139
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:44,035
I told her I was snacky!

140
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,425
You ready to put your back into it, Applejack?

141
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:48,925
Sure am, Miss Jubilee.

142
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:52,065
Terrific. Come on in, girls!

143
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:56,985
What are you all doing here?

144
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:58,585
We're your cherry sorters.

145
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:01,475
- Shall we get started?
- Fine!

146
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:04,715
Red cherries go in one bin and
yellow cherries go in the other.

147
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:06,415
Simple as cherry pie.

148
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,875
Just one teensy thing to remember – have fun!

149
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,675
What are you five up to?

150
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,295
You made working on a cherry
orchard sound... so delightful.

151
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:24,225
Well, just remember :
no talking about Ponyville.

152
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,225
Fine!

153
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,445
Why don't you quit talking and get walking?

154
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:53,955
So, AJ... how was Canterlot?

155
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,905
Not talking about Ponyville,
talking about Canterlot...

156
00:11:57,905 --> 00:11:59,105
...totally different town.

157
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:00,605
Canterlot was fine.

158
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:02,115
Was the rodeo fun?

159
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:03,115
Yes.

160
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:05,835
Did you meet some nice ponies there?

161
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:07,035
Some.

162
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,935
Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok?

163
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:11,545
What about Calamity Mane?

164
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:12,925
Yes, saw 'em both.

165
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:20,625
And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?

166
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:23,825
Well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo.

167
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:24,875
Real good treats.

168
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:28,705
Um, excuse me?

169
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:31,455
Cherry links, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts.

170
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:34,135
We struck up a conversation
being orchard folk and all.

171
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,295
So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?

172
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:36,915
Yes.

173
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:39,215
Did you tell her why you weren't going back?

174
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:41,455
No, 'cuz it was none of her business!

175
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:45,245
Can you please slow down?

176
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:48,265
Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?

177
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:48,995
No!

178
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:00,075
Is it because you were insulted when...

179
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:02,105
...I gave you that book on organized orchards?

180
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:03,065
No!

181
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:11,285
Is it because you were insulted
when I insulted your hair?

182
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:12,815
No, no, NO!

183
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:14,465
I'm not telling you why, so just...

184
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:15,555
Stop!

185
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:32,635
Well, girls, we seem to be striking out.

186
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,075
That's 'cause we're playing too nice.

187
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:38,745
Yes. Desperate times do call
for desperate measures.

188
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:41,735
It's time to call in the big guns.

189
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,015
Hey Applejack.
Need some help?

190
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,405
You promise not to ask me any questions?

191
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:03,665
I promise.

192
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,245
Have you ever had a cherry chonga?

193
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:14,245
Oh! Sorry, that was a question.

194
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:16,145
That kind of question is fine, Pinkie.

195
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,505
No, I never had a cherry chonga.

196
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:21,175
Well no wonder, because I made it up myself!

197
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:24,255
A cherry chonga is mashed up
cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried.

198
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,415
Cherry chonga. Great name, huh?

199
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:27,925
Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimmy cherry.

200
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:30,405
Oh, that's good too. Which
do you think sounds better?

201
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:31,705
Cherry chonga or chimmy cherry?

202
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,705
Or what if I combine them?
Chimmy cherry chonga!

203
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:37,175
What sounds the funniest?
I like funny words!

204
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,075
One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'!

205
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:40,245
I didn't make that one up.

206
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:43,655
I would work in a kumquat orchard
just so I could say 'kumquat' all day!

207
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:45,905
Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat!

208
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:50,105
And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that
just the funnest thing to say?

209
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,605
Pickle barrel pickle barrel pickle barrel.

210
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:53,105
Say it with me!

211
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:56,605
Pickle barrel kumquat, pickle barrel kumquat,
pickle barrel kumquat, chimmy cherry chonga!

212
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,275
No! Make it stop, make it stop!

213
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:02,905
The only way to make it stop
is for you to spill the beans.

214
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:03,705
Never!

215
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:08,105
Speaking of beans, did you ever realize
how many words rhyme with 'beans'?

216
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:12,055
- Lean, mean, spleen, I'm queen, bean...
- Alright, alright!

217
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:13,935
I'll tell everypony what's goin' on!

218
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:16,335
Just please stop talkin'!

219
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:20,935
But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at
breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out.

220
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:24,285
Tomorrow, huh?
I don't know...

221
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:25,895
Do you Pinkie promise?

222
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:32,065
I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast.

223
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,665
Pinkie promise.

224
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:44,235
I'm glad we're finally gonna get
some answers from Applejack.

225
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,985
Yeah, maybe.

226
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:51,595
Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta
'fess up after making a Pinkie promise.

227
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:56,095
Good morning, Applejack. You ready for...

228
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:04,695
Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!

229
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,995
Applejack!

230
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,825
You Pinkie promised!

231
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,785
Applejack, come back here!

232
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:21,915
Giddy up, fellas, I gotta
get the heck out of Dodge!

233
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,975
She's gonna get away!

234
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:28,435
Oh no, she won't!
Look, girls!

235
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:32,025
Follow that stagecoach!

236
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:44,175
We have you now!

237
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,145
What the hay?

238
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:08,875
Pull over!

239
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,865
Hey! Cut that out!

240
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:15,755
I'll pay you double to outrun them.

241
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:19,035
We'll pay you triple to slow down!

242
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:24,395
I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!

243
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,435
That was rude!

244
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:32,995
Get them!
Get them!

245
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:35,135
Come on, Fluttershy!

246
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,525
C'mon, y'all!
Go, go!

247
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:52,385
Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!

248
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,465
Pinkie, I did not break my promise!

249
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:55,465
Wha?

250
00:17:55,465 --> 00:18:00,305
If y'all reckon back, I told you that I'd
tell you everything at breakfast.

251
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:01,735
But I didn't come to breakfast.

252
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:05,965
I couldn't come to that breakfast, not
if it meant telling y'all what happened.

253
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,565
Well, I... I...

254
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:11,985
I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell
y'all the truth. I just can't.

255
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:15,075
Well I heard a sorry in there,
so that'll have to do for now.

256
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:17,395
I'll get a real apology later.
Rarity, catch me.

257
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:18,995
What? Pinkie!

258
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:21,905
Rainbow, go back!

259
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:24,745
No time! They knew what
they were getting into!

260
00:18:58,445 --> 00:19:00,785
Lady, you're trouble.

261
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:05,555
Try and catch me now.

262
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:08,795
Oh, nuts.

263
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:18,935
Not so fast!

264
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:28,115
Fine. Now you know.

265
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:29,475
Know what?

266
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:31,825
Well, just look!

267
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:37,875
I am. You won an amazing number of
ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!

268
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,285
Don't you get it? There's every
color of ribbon down there.

269
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:45,205
Every color... but... blue.

270
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:50,015
I came in fourth, third, even second.

271
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:55,185
But I didn't win one first prize... and I
certainly didn't win any prize money.

272
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:58,005
But the telegram said you were gonna send money.

273
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:01,545
That's why I came here.
I wanted to earn some money.

274
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:04,325
After that big old send off Ponyville gave me...

275
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:07,165
...I just didn't have the nerve
to come home empty-hooved.

276
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,325
I couldn't come home a failure.

277
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:12,925
Applejack, you're not a failure.

278
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,425
And we're your friends!

279
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:17,435
We don't care if you came in fiftieth place!

280
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:19,915
You're still number one in our books.

281
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:23,455
So... you're not upset, or disappointed?

282
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:27,165
But what about the mayor?

283
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:31,275
I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't
get that money to fix the broken roof.

284
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:35,795
Applejack, we can always find a
way to fix that hole in the roof.

285
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:41,095
But if you don't come back, we'll never
be able to fix the hole in our hearts.

286
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:48,845
Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!

287
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:53,715
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

288
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:58,665
"...it's a tad easier to be proud when you come
in first than it is when you finish further back."

289
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:02,445
"But there's no reason to hide when
you don't do as well as you'd hoped."

290
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:05,955
"You can't run away from your problems."

291
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:09,525
"Better to run to your friends and family."

292
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:16,635
What did you think, Rarity?

293
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:19,805
Chimmy cherry, or cherry chonga?
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?

294
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:24,295
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?

295
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:27,865
When I get back, you're
gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!
