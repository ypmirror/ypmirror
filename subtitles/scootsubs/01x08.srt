1
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,550
Hmm.

2
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,300
Ha!

3
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,280
Perfect.

4
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,970
Just take the broken limbs down,
Rarity.

5
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,190
Don't y'all care about nothing
other than prettifyin'?

6
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,890
Somepony has to.

7
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,890
You are making
an absolute mess

8
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,560
Of the town square,
Applejack.

9
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,770
Yeah, well, the storm's gonna
make an even bigger mess

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,430
If we don't prune
all these loose branches

11
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,250
So they don't tumble down
on anypony.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,130
I simply cannot imagine
why the pegasus ponies

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,210
Would schedule a dreadful
downpour this evening

14
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,720
And ruin what could have been
a glorious sunny day.

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,950
 think more practical-Like,
will ya?

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,030
They accidentally skipped
a scheduled sprinkle last week,

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,920
So we need a doozy of a downpour
to make up for it, is all.

18
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,770
Oh, no!

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,540
My wonderfully styled mane
shall be ruined!

20
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,120
You should have hurried up
and finished the job already!

21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,740
Ooh! Aah! Oh! Oh!

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,520
It's coming down too fast!
Aah! Oh! Oh! Aah!

23
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,450
Help me!

24
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,090
Uh...there.

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,370
Hunker down to your heart's
content whilst I finish things.

26
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,860
Oh, no, no! No!

27
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,380
What now?

28
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,560
I'd prefer not to get
my hooves muddy.

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,850
There is just
no pleasin' you, is there?

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,790
Everything's got to be
just so.

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,100
Oh, well, and how does
muddying my hooves

32
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,770
Serve any useful purpose?

33
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,160
Y'all wouldn't know useful
if it came up and bit you.

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,460
That doesn't even
make any sense.

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,860
Does so.
Does not.

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,450
Does so.
Does not.

37
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,890
Does so.
Does not.

38
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,670
Does so infinity.
Ha!

39
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,940
Does not infinity plus one.
Ha!

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,110
What say
we go our separate ways

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,800
Before one of us says something
she will regret?

42
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,270
I reckon y'all are gonna say
something you'll regret first.

43
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,440
On the contrary, I believe it
shall most certainly be you

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,390
Who says something
you will regret first.

45
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,290
I'm not sayin' anything!

46
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,170
Nor am i!

47
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,920
Y'all just be on your way,
then.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,240
After you!

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,410
Aah!
Aah!

50
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,390
Perhaps we should stick together
for now

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,410
And find some shelter.

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,640
Uh-Huh,
perhaps we should...

53
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,910
and fast.

54
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,790
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

55
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,980
Nice and dry under here...
sort of.

56
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,320
Oh!
Unacceptable.

57
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,930
Applejack! Rarity!

58
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,470
Applejack! Rarity!

59
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,810
Twilight?
Twilight?

60
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,920
Come inside, girls,
quick.

61
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,950
Whoa, nellie.

62
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,180
Is inside a tree

63
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,190
Really the best place to be
in a lightning storm?

64
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,130
It is if you have
a magical lightning rod

65
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,530
Protecting your home
like I do.

66
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,580
Come on in.

67
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,920
We are most grateful
for your invitation.

68
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,190
Thank you kindly
for your hospitality.

69
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,630
Uh, do be
a polite houseguest

70
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,400
And go wash up, please,
won't you?

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,660
If I got to spend
one more second

72
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,460
With that fussbudget Rarity
today,

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,970
I can't be held responsible
for what I'm gonna do.

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,460
Some storm, huh?

75
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,450
The pegasus ponies sure have
outdone themselves this time.

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,700
I hope you and Applejack

77
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,270
Don't have any trouble
getting home.

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,240
It may, indeed,
be a problem.

79
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,270
Well, you're welcome to stay
if need be.

80
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,660
Spike is away in Canterlot
on royal business.

81
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,290
I'm home all alone tonight.

82
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,430
You and Applejack should
totally sleep over!

83
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,510
We'll have a slumber party!
I've always wanted one of those.

84
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,320
Oh, goodness.

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,820
Uh, I do believe

86
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,480
I have another engagement
scheduled for this evening

87
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,690
That completely slipped my mind
until just now.

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,530
Oh, silly me.

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,300
I can't possibly stay here
all night...with Applejack.

90
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,320
"Slumber 101:

91
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,020
"All you've ever wanted to know
about slumber parties

92
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,470
But were afraid to ask."

93
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,510
My own personal copy.

94
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,280
It's a fantastic
reference guide.

95
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,860
You should see
the table of contents.

96
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,780
I've been waiting
for a chance to use it,

97
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,350
And today's the day.

98
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,560
This is gonna be so great!

99
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,190
Yes, uh, great.

100
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,730
What in tarnation?!

101
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,350
Now wait
just a goldarn minute!

102
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,600
You make me wash
the mud off my hooves,

103
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,200
But it's okay for y'all
to have mud all over your faces?

104
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,230
Silly.
This is called a mud mask.

105
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,030
It's to refresh
and rejuvenate your complexion.

106
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,630
We're giving each other
makeovers!

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,160
We have to do it.
It says so in the book.

108
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,200
"Slumber 101:
everything you..."

109
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,920
Oh, hey,
would you look at the time?

110
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,590
I got to skedaddle
on home quick.

111
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,590
I'm powerful late
for, uh -- For something.

112
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,690
Uh, good night.

113
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,140
Aah!

114
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,090
Or maybe I'll sit here
for a spell.

115
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,810
Hooray, slumber party!

116
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,430
blech!

117
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,130
What in the world
is this for?

118
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,410
To reduce the puffiness
around one's eyes, of course.

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,970
Puffiness, shmuffiness!

120
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,240
That's good eatin'.

121
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,730
Isn't this exciting?

122
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,060
We'll do everything
by the book,

123
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,950
And that will make
my slumber party officially fun.

124
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,430
Did you hear that,
Applejack?

125
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,550
You certainly would not want
to do anything

126
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,710
That would ruin Twilight's
very first slumber party,

127
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,020
Would you?

128
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,250
Of course not.

129
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,020
And you wouldn't, either,
I reckon.

130
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,850
So, do we have
an agreement?

131
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,540
You betcha.

132
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,970
Oh, gross!

133
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,270
You know, there's messy,

134
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,930
And there's
just plain rude.

135
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,110
You know, there's fussy,

136
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,620
And there's just plain
gettin'-On-My-Nerves.

137
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,470
Fortunately, I can get along
with anypony,

138
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,740
No matter how difficult
she may be.

139
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,860
Oh, yeah?

140
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,960
Well, i'm
the get-Alongingest pony

141
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,970
You're ever gonna meet.

142
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,900
That's not even a word.

143
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,210
This is gonna be the bestest
slumber party ever!

144
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,830
Yay!

145
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,370
Yay.
Yay.

146
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,110
So...

147
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,400
how are you getting along
over there, Applejack?

148
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,710
Just fine, Rarity.

149
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,210
This is so awesome!

150
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,310
Makeovers -- Check.

151
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,660
Ooh! It says here
we have to tell ghost stories.

152
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,750
Who wants to go first?

153
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,800
Me!

154
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,180
I'd like to tell y'all
the terrifying tale

155
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,920
Of the prissy ghost

156
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,540
Who drove everypony crazy
with their unnecessary neatness.

157
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,910
Ooooh!

158
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,790
I'm sure y'all are familiar
with that one.

159
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,750
Never heard of it,
but I have a much better one.

160
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,500
It's the horrifying story

161
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,680
Of the messy,
inconsiderate ghost

162
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,050
Who irritated everypony
within 100 miles!

163
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,490
Ooooh!

164
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,810
That's not a real story!
You made it up!

165
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,670
It is a ghost story.
They're all made up.

166
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,710
Aah!

167
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,910
I've got one.

168
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,010
This story is called "the legend
of the headless horse."

169
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,220
It was a dark and stormy night

170
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,030
Just like this one,

171
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,800
And three ponies
were having a slumber party

172
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,040
Just...like...this one.

173
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,010
And just when the last pony
thought she was safe,

174
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,720
There, standing
right behind her,

175
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,110
Just inches away, was...

176
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,570
the headless horse!

177
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,460
Aaaah!
Aaaah!

178
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,370
Ghost story -- Check.

179
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,570
Now, who wants s'mores?

180
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,520
Then you place
one marshmallow

181
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,710
On the top
of the chocolate.

182
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,130
And be sure it's centered.
That's critical.

183
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,780
And then carefully
put another

184
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,490
Perfectly square graham cracker
on the top.

185
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,210
And...done.

186
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,380
Ta-Da!

187
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,730
Ooh!

188
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,330
Nah, you just eat 'em.

189
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,370
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

190
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,030
You could at least
say, "excuse me."

191
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,210
Oh, I was just about to,
but you interrupted me.

192
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,090
Pardon.

193
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,630
S'mores -- Check.

194
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,420
Now the next item of fun
we have to do is truth or dare.

195
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,210
I dare Applejack

196
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,400
To do something carefully
and neatly for a change.

197
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,440
Oh, yeah?

198
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,770
Well, I dare Rarity
to lighten up

199
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,960
And stop obsessin' over
every last little detail

200
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,050
For a change.

201
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,580
I think the truth of the matter
is that somepony

202
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,070
Could stand to pay a little more
attention to detail.

203
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,590
And I think the truth is

204
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,620
Somepony ought to quit
with her fussin'

205
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,440
So the rest of us
can get things done.

206
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,330
Um, I don't think this is how
the game's supposed to work.

207
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,070
You have to give
an honest answer to any question

208
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,560
Or do whatever anypony
dares you to do.

209
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,400
I dares you
to step outside

210
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,720
And let your precious tidy mane
get ruined again.

211
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,110
You have to.
It's the rule.

212
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,110
Ha!

213
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,160
Fine!

214
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,200
Okay, I dare Applejack
to play dress-Up

215
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,780
In a froufrou, glittery,
lacy outfit.

216
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,200
Happy?

217
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,540
Very.

218
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,860
Um, do I ever get a turn?

219
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,030
I dare you to enter the next
rodeo when it comes to town.

220
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,230
I dare you not to enter the next
rodeo that comes to town.

221
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,290
I dare you to not comb your mane
100 times before bed!

222
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,320
And I dare you to comb yours
just once!

223
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,000
I, uh -- I think we should check
off truth or dare and move on.

224
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,850
Let's see what our next fun,
fun, fun thing is, shall we?

225
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,460
Hmm, what does this mean?
"Pillow fight"?

226
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,040
Oh, please.

227
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,810
I am not at all interested

228
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,200
In participating
in something so crude.

229
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,160
Oh!

230
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,330
It...is...on!

231
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,390
Hyah!

232
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,900
Yah! Yah! Yah!

233
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,890
Oh, I get it.

234
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,220
Pillow...fight.

235
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,020
Fun!

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,870
Ugh! Aah!

237
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,950
uh, girls...

238
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,240
maybe we should take it down
a notch.

239
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,600
I will if she will.

240
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,530
She started it.

241
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,960
Maybe we should just call it
a night and get some sleep.

242
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,260
Keep your muddy hooves
on you side of the bed.

243
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,680
My hooves ain't muddy.

244
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,850
They were.

245
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,460
There might still be
a little on them.

246
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,290
There ain't. See?

247
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,550
Ew!

248
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,310
Now who's bein'
inconsiderate?

249
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,660
I have
to make the bed again

250
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,960
So the blanket
will be right.

251
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,690
Get up.

252
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,520
Hey!

253
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,610
Unh-Unh-Unh.
You'll ruin it.

254
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,300
You have to do it
like this.

255
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,300
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.

256
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,680
Geronimo!

257
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,760
Hey!

258
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,310
Ahh.

259
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,350
You did that on purpose.

260
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,120
Um, yeah.

261
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,970
Get up
so I can fix it again.

262
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,460
Can't hear you.
I'm asleep.

263
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,550
Hmph!

264
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,270
I ain't budgin'.

265
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,060
You will
if you want any blanket!

266
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,890
Give it back!

267
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,100
I will not!

268
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,250
Yes, you will!

269
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,030
Won't!
Will!

270
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,610
Won't!
Will!

271
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,810
Won't!
Will!

272
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,660
Enough!

273
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,750
It says right here
that the number-One thing

274
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,270
You're supposed to do
at a slumber party is have fun.

275
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,020
And thanks to you two,
I can't check that off.

276
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,210
I've been tryin' my darndest
to get along.

277
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,260
No, it is I
who have been trying my best.

278
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,490
No, it was me.

279
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,390
No, it was I.

280
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,340
Me!
I!

281
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,210
I hope you're happy,
both of you.

282
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,180
You've ruined
my very first slumber party --

283
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,810
The makeover, the s'mores,
truth or dare, the pillow fight!

284
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,800
I mean, is there anything else
that could possibly go wrong?!

285
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,560
Sorry I asked.

286
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,270
You see?

287
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,960
That's why we needed
to take down

288
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,070
All those loose branches
in town, not spiffy 'em up.

289
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,950
But I --
Out of my way, missy!

290
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,920
Time's a-Wastin'.

291
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,230
Wait! Stop! Don't!

292
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,910
No waitin'! No stoppin'!

293
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,860
Doin'!

294
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,960
And that, my friends, is what
we call "gettin' her done."

295
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,620
Aah!

296
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,060
I tried to tell you it would
come crashing down in here!

297
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,360
Well, you should have
tried harder!

298
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,030
I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.

299
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,770
It's --
Well, it's not okay.

300
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,430
There's a giant tree branch
in the middle of my bedroom!

301
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,930
And the book
doesn't say anything

302
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,210
About having a giant tree branch
at your slumber party --

303
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,200
Or at least I haven't found
that entry yet.

304
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,910
What in tarnation
are y'all doin' over there?!

305
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,460
Cleaning up this mess
somepony made!

306
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,320
Who was that again?
Oh, right -- That's you!

307
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,540
We got to do something!

308
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,800
Baking, bffs, brothers.

309
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,820
There's nothing in here
about branches.

310
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,150
Rarity, for pony's sake,
stop sweatin' the small stuff

311
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,670
And help me get rid
of this thing!

312
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,360
I said hustle over here
and help me!

313
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,910
Look...i'm sorry,
all right?

314
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,360
What was that?

315
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,380
I said, "i'm sorry"!

316
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,050
I should have
listened to you

317
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,210
When you noticed where this here
branch would end up.

318
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,510
Your annoyin' attention
to detail

319
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,440
Would have saved us
from this whole mess.

320
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,710
But right now, you need to stop
bein' so dang fussy,

321
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,230
Pickin' up
all those little things,

322
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,210
And help me move
the one big thing in here

323
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,530
That actually matters!

324
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,090
Please!

325
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,110
Uh, uh,
but I'll get all icky.

326
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,730
Consarn it!

327
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,030
What the -- You --
I mean, yes,

328
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,610
Ickiness is often a side effect
of hard work.

329
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,410
But y'all need
to get over it

330
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,630
On account of I just can't
fix this mess I made myself.

331
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,750
I need your help.

332
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,320
Ohh.

333
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,900
Let's do this!

334
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,490
Well, they do have a section
about backyard slumber parties.

335
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,070
Is that what we're doing
right now?

336
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,330
Does this count
as camping?

337
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,190
Ohh.

338
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,610
I look awful.

339
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,380
Better?

340
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,430
Thanks.

341
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,810
Ooh, pretty.
Where did these come from?

342
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,610
They're not in the book,
either.

343
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,360
Is it bigger than a barn?

344
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,440
Nope.

345
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,410
Is it smaller
than a saddle?

346
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,770
no.

347
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,860
Only 3 of your 20 questions
left.

348
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,620
We're never gonna guess
what you're thinkin' of.

349
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,530
It could be anything.

350
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
Are we getting warmer?

351
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,670
Why?
Is it too cold in here for you?

352
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,890
I can turn up the heat.

353
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,110
She means, are we gettin'
any closer with our guesses?

354
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,340
Oh! No.

355
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,470
And that technically counted
as a question,

356
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,820
So only two more left.

357
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,890
Is it...

358
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,800
a 6-Legged pony
with a purple, polka-Dotted mane

359
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,210
And shootin' stars
comin' out of its eyes...

360
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,680
who flies through the air
all over the world

361
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,360
To hide magic,
sparkly eggs?

362
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,260
That's it!

363
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,900
It is?
It is?

364
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,160
No.

365
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,300
It's that.

366
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,510
But it was just so nice to see
you two finally getting along,

367
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,780
I wanted you to be able
to win together.

368
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,110
See?

369
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,450
We could have been having fun
like this all along.

370
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,320
If only somepony
hadn't been so persnickety.

371
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,080
Well, maybe she wouldn't
have been

372
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,210
If somepony else
hadn't been so sloppy.

373
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,400
Sorry for bein'
such a pain in the patootie.

374
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,890
Oh, no.
I'm sure I was much worse.

375
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,340
That's kind of you to say,
but I'm the one who's sorry.

376
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,370
Oh, I'm much more sorry
than you are.

377
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,120
Are not.
Are too.

378
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,670
Are not.
Are too.

379
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,290
Are not.
Are too.

380
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,650
I declare my first slumber party
a success.

381
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,260
Yeah!
Yeah!

382
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,220
Have fun -- Check.

383
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,650
Now take two steps
to your left.

384
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,730
Uh, no, my left.

385
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,460
Well, which is it?
Whoa!

386
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,300
That mess is your fault,
not mine.

387
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,650
Sorry.

388
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,280
"Dear princess Celestia,
it's hard to believe

389
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,910
"That two ponies who seem
to have so little in common

390
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,430
"Could ever get along.

391
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,270
"But I found out
that if you embrace

392
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,880
"Each other's differences,
you just might be surprised

393
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,960
To discover a way to be friends
after all."

394
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,610
So...

395
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,760
who's up for another
slumber party tomorrow night?

396
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,420
How about a week from thursday?

397
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,380
Ooh, how about two weeks
from saturday?

398
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,800
A month from now?
