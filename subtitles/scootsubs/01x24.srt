1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,610
This meteor shower tonight
is gonna be amazing!

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,250
Awesome!

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,690
You know, this shower only
happens once every 100 years.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,510
A centennial celebration!

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,780
Uh, unh!

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,030
We better
get a move on.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,610
Don't want to be late!

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,010
Ahh! There.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,110
Spike, did you grab
my quill and ink?

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,310
check!

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,470
Scrolls?
Check!

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,590
I've also packed a telescope,
apples, bananas, fruit punch,

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,770
And my freshly baked,
homemade,

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,750
Triple-Decker, nut-Crazy
vanilla-Cream cookies!

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,030
I can see that.

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,690
Once again,
you've read my mind, Spike.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,090
And that is why you are
my number-one assistant.

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,650
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you.

20
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,850
That is why you are
my number-one assistant.

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,430
Missed that. Huh?

22
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,010
I said...

23
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,190
come on.

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,390
Let's get going.

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,510
Wait! I almost forgot!

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,530
I want to bring
"the astronomical astronomers'

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,110
Almanac to all things
astronomy."

28
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,470
The astro nomo lomo--
Hummanuh what?

29
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,130
You know, that really old,
big, blue book

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,510
On stars, moons, planets,
the universe?

31
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,970
Right. Check!

32
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,810
Ah...ah...ah!

33
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,630
Ah!

34
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,530
A-A-A-A-H-Choo!

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,250
Hey!

36
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,810
What's taking my number-one
assistant so long?

37
00:01:50,370 --> 00:02:00,230
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
we have muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

38
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,470
I was sure I put "the
astronomers' guide" back.

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,070
The book would have
helped me identify

40
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,570
Different planets
and stars tonight.

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,950
Well, maybe
someone borrowed it.

42
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,450
Besides,
you don't need that book.

43
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,310
You can already name
all the planets and stars

44
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,370
'Cause you're super smart
and astronomically awesome!

45
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,250
Thanks, Spike.
You're such a flatterer.

46
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,070
Yeah, I'm a sweet-Talker.

47
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,730
And a number-one assistant.
Right?

48
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,670
Check!

49
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,670
Wow, Twilight!

50
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,830
You're lucky to have
such a rad assistant.

51
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,170
I wish I had someone
to do whatever I told them.

52
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,310
Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me!

53
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,390
I'll do whatever you want,
Rainbow Dash!

54
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,470
Oh, yeah, pipsqueak?

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,570
How about
taking out the trash?

56
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,990
Yes, ma'am!

57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,530
Do we have Spike to thank again
for this amazing spread?

58
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,970
Isn't he
simply amazing?

59
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,550
Aw, come on.

60
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,330
I said, "come on."

61
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,630
Little Spikey-Wikey,

62
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,330
Who knew that big,
ferocious dragons

63
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,430
Started off
so cutesy-Wootsy?

64
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,130
Spike, you are such
a little star

65
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,410
That I had to make
this little bow tie for you.

66
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,170
Gosh, you guys
are embarrassing me.

67
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,390
Stop it!

68
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,830
Twilight, your turn.

69
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,510
Spike, that's enough.

70
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,190
Oh, right.
That's enough.

71
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,330
Hey, everypony,
the show is starting!

72
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,690
Wow!
Cool!

73
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,850
Wow! That's amazing!

74
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,370
Whoa!

75
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,530
So cool!

76
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,430
So cool!

77
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,190
That's amazing!

78
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,410
Whoa!
Whoa!

79
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,750
Huh?

80
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,770
Mmm!

81
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,710
Mmm, wow!

82
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,690
These cookies are delish!

83
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,950
Spike made them.
Speaking of...

84
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,970
Spike?
Can you bring us some punch?

85
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:39,870
Spike?

86
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,730
Ooh, poor little thing.

87
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,710
Aww, he's worked himself
to the bone.

88
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,550
And now the punch
has been...

89
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,630
Spiked!

90
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,330
Good night, Spike.

91
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,330
Sweet dreams,
number-one assistant.

92
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,730
"The study of comets.

93
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,270
"Comets are small,
irregularly shaped bodies

94
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,010
"That are made of nonvolatile
grains and frozen gases.

95
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,010
They --"

96
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,590
Hmm.

97
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,190
"...Have body structures
that are fragile and diverse."

98
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,310
Ooh, shoot!

99
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,470
Ooh, this is a job for Spike.

100
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,210
If only he were awake!

101
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,150
Hoot!

102
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,870
Wait! Don't go!

103
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,050
Don't be afraid.

104
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,630
Thank you for returning
my scroll.

105
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,810
Hoot! Hoot!

106
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,190
Hoot! Hoot!

107
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,230
Gosh, it's cold tonight.

108
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,430
Say, would you like
to relax in here

109
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,870
And keep me company
while I work?

110
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,210
Hoot! Hoot!

111
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,710
Now, where was i?

112
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,830
Oh, yes --

113
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,830
"...Fragile and diverse
with a surrounding cloud

114
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,490
"Of material called a coma
that grows in size

115
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,810
And brightens
as the comet..."

116
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,610
Aah!

117
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,970
Aah! I overslept!

118
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,770
I know it's already 10:00,

119
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,390
But I'm scaly-Tailed
and bright-Eyed

120
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,550
And ready to work
twice as fast!

121
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,990
Oh, please don't be upset,
Twilight.

122
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,430
What do you want for breakfast?
Oatmeal?

123
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,350
How about a sunflower smoothie?
Grass pancakes?

124
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,550
Spike, don't worry.

125
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,410
But my morning chores.

126
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,770
It's okay.

127
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,430
Aloysius did them for you.

128
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,810
Who?

129
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,830
He's our new
junior assistant.

130
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,430
He's gonna help out
with your chores

131
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,110
So you won't be so tired
all the time.

132
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,370
Wh --

133
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,750
Wh-What do we need
a junior assistant for?

134
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,670
I'm not tired.
I do fine on my own.

135
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,970
I don't need sleep. I --
Spike, don't worry.

136
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,990
He's just here
to help out a little.

137
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,190
Now, I have to go out.

138
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,350
So why don't you introduce
yourself to Aloysius?

139
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,650
He's in the library.

140
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,390
Worried? Do I look worried?
I'm not worried.

141
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,570
Who's worried?

142
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,550
Hello?

143
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,310
Hello?!

144
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,350
Whoa!

145
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,950
Dude, that's creepy.

146
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,750
Uh, hi, there.
I'm Spike.

147
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,090
I'm sure Twilight has told you
all about me.

148
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,350
Hoot.

149
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,790
Uh, Spike?
You know, assistant number one?

150
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,590
Hoot?

151
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,750
I'm Spike!

152
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,210
And who are you?
What are you?

153
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,070
Hoo.

154
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,290
Who?
Hoo!

155
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,210
I thought your name
was Aloysius!
Hoo?

156
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,170
Okay, who, Aloysius,
whatever!

157
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,570
I'm Spike, okay?

158
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,390
Look, all you need to know

159
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,490
Is that I'm number one
and you're number two!

160
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,930
Got it?
Hoo?

161
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,570
So, a man of mystery, huh?

162
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,570
I'm keeping my eye on you.

163
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,510
I've got eyes in the back
of m head, too, you know!

164
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,850
Unh, well, not really.

165
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,370
But you know what I mean!

166
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,270
That bird is out for my job.
He wants to be number one.

167
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,230
Well, I'll prove to Twilight
that I deserve to be number one,

168
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,050
Not freaky feathers over there.

169
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,570
I won't let him have my job
if it's the last thing I do!

170
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,610
Oh, what a fantastical,
fluffalicious,

171
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,730
Feathery, little friend!

172
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,230
I'm hoo-Ked!

173
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,810
He's just wonderful.

174
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,770
"he's just wonderful!"

175
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,330
Uh, yes, wonderful.

176
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,830
He is quite...
the charmer.

177
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,910
And Aloysius,
you're such a star.

178
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,410
I just had to make
this little bow for you.

179
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,130
Ugh!

180
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,990
What's he all
saddle-Sore about?

181
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,530
He's probably just jealous
of Aloysius.

182
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,430
Maybe Spike feels threatened
or worried

183
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,050
That Aloysius will replace him.

184
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,650
Replace him?
Ha! That's crazy.

185
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,970
Spike knows
he can't be replaced.

186
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,970
They're trying to replace me!

187
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,970
I better step it up
and make sure

188
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,650
That Twilight and Aloysius know
that I'm still number one!

189
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,210
Hey, Spike, can you fetch me
that book called

190
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,610
"Two headed myth--"
"Mythological mysteries"!

191
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,870
I know where it is.

192
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,650
Thanks, Aloysius.

193
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,490
Hey, Spike, no worries.

194
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,670
Aloysius flew up
and got the book for me.

195
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,650
O-M-G, I guess I need
"ferrets of fairyland," too.

196
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,550
Hey!

197
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,030
Whoa! Whoa!

198
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,990
Climb down from there
before you fall.

199
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,090
Whoa!

200
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,430
Ugh!

201
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,670
Shoot!

202
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,850
Yes, sir!

203
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,490
My last writing quill --
It's broken.

204
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,570
Never fear. Spike, your
number-one assistant, is here!

205
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,410
Quill, quill.
Where is it?

206
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,490
Not here.

207
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,870
Quill...

208
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,290
Quill. Where is it?!

209
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,370
Hoo.

210
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,890
Where am I gonna
get a quill?

211
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,250
Spike! Wait! Wait!

212
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,490
But the store is called
"quills and sofas."

213
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,650
You only sell two things!

214
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,230
Sorry, junior. All out of quills
until monday.

215
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,870
Need a sofa?

216
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,010
Ugh!

217
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,530
I swore I had one
here somewhere.

218
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,090
Ah! Here it is.
A quince!

219
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,950
Not a quince.
A quill!

220
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,850
Right! A quail?

221
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,630
A quilt!
A quesadilla?

222
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,710
Ugh.

223
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,330
Aha! A quiche.

224
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,630
Not a quiche. A quill!

225
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,290
Nope, sorry.
All out of quills.

226
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,970
Aw, shoot.

227
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,570
Come on, chicken!

228
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,750
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky!

229
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,270
Here, chick, chick,
chick, chicky!

230
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,350
Come here!

231
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,270
Unh!

232
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,230
Come here!

233
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,330
No! Wait! No! Wait!

234
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,230
Stop! Quit it!

235
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,830
Spike...

236
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,690
to the rescue!

237
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,770
Oh. Spike.

238
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,070
I was calling out for you

239
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,730
When you were turning
this place upside down.

240
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,650
Aloysius gave me one of his
feathers to use as a quill.

241
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,630
That's just great.

242
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,570
Perfect!

243
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,730
Sweet!

244
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,230
I think I'll just, uh, finish up
the rest of my chores.

245
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,370
Or did Aloysius
already do them?

246
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,070
Oh, no, no.
There are quite a lot of them.

247
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,470
Well, that's fine
because I can just stay up

248
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,410
All night and finish --

249
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,010
Poor Spike.
He'll come around.

250
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,890
He's genuinely
a good, little guy.

251
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,250
Huh?

252
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,330
Spike, what is this?

253
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,990
You said
this book was missing.

254
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,570
Well, Aloysius found it
right where it belongs,

255
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,030
But like this.

256
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,550
How did it get this way?

257
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,910
Uh, well, um, you see,

258
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,310
I-I just didn't want
to disappoint you, and, uh --

259
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,610
Have you ever seen
a dragon sneeze?

260
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,470
I've seen a dragon lie.

261
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,790
I'm very disappointed
in you, Spike.

262
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,590
You set me up!

263
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,910
Well, two can play
that game.

264
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:56,910
Hoo!

265
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,210
Not "hoo." Two!

266
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,670
Ugh!

267
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,250
Aloysius is out
to take my place.

268
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,210
I just know it!

269
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,170
I've got to stop him. But how?

270
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,790
Ahhhhh.

271
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,270
Come along, opal.

272
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,430
Let's hurry up and get
to Fluttershy's tea party.

273
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,630
So lifelike.

274
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,370
And when Twilight discovers
it shredded up on her floor,

275
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,710
She'll think mouse-eating
Aloysius is to blame,

276
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,650
And I'll be number one again!

277
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,710
That poor little
field mouse --

278
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,550
Torn to Pieces!

279
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,290
It must have been Aloysius!

280
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,350
You know, since owls eat,
you know, mice.

281
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,210
What a terrible,
terrible bird!

282
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,770
He must be punished!

283
00:14:59,210 --> 00:14:59,650
Right?

284
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,210
Spike, I don't know
what upsets me more --

285
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,850
That you deliberately tried
to set up Aloysius

286
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,050
Or that
you actually thought

287
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,770
This pathetic attempt
would work.

288
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,390
You've let your jealousy
get the best of you, Spike.

289
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,390
I am truly disappointed.

290
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,530
This is not the Spike
I know and love!

291
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,450
She --

292
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,190
She doesn't love me anymore.

293
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,610
Twilight hates me.

294
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,150
And I'm cold, hungry,
tired, and lonely.

295
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,030
Could it get any worse?

296
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,930
I guess that's a "yes."

297
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,070
Hello?

298
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,110
Hello?!

299
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,170
What is that?!

300
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,090
Wow! If this is what
running away is all about,

301
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,590
I never want to go home!

302
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,810
Gems! Mmm! Whoo-Hoo!

303
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,330
Even if my tummy's full,

304
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,390
The rest of me is still empty.

305
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,390
I miss Twilight
and the pony gang.

306
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,770
But she doesn't love me anymore,

307
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,870
So I'm better off here --
All by myself.

308
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,470
Wow, it seems
to be getting warmer.

309
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,270
This steam is great
for my complexion,

310
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,470
But it's sure getting hot
in here.

311
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,830
What are you doing
in my cave?

312
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,130
And why are you eating
my gems?

313
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,250
Uh, hey, aboo.

314
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,090
I didn't know
this was your cave.

315
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,490
And I didn't know
these were your gems,

316
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,230
But we're cool, right?

317
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,390
Whoa, whoa!

318
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,870
Hey, uh, we're like brothers,
you know?

319
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,450
I mean, you're a dragon
and I'm a dragon.

320
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,970
It's us against the world,
right?

321
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,470
Aah!

322
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,890
Uh, you don't scare me!

323
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,190
So you're big.

324
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,130
Really big.

325
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,730
And your claws
are super sharp.

326
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,110
Tail...

327
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,270
...extra spiky.

328
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,010
But, uh,
you don't scare me!

329
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,830
Ha!

330
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,830
How'd you like that?

331
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,670
Uh, I'd love to stay,
but got to go!

332
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,090
See ya!
Wouldn't want to be ya!

333
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,350
Aah!

334
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,290
Aah!

335
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,990
Hoo! Hoo!

336
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,630
Spike, over here!

337
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,410
Am I glad to see you!

338
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,390
Hurry! Hop on!

339
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,190
It's too dark!
I can't see!

340
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,530
Hoo! Hoo, hoo!

341
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,010
Spike, we were
so worried about you.

342
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,830
I was so worried
about you!

343
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,570
Why did you run away?

344
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,890
I thought
you didn't need me anymore

345
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,110
And that you didn't
love me anymore.

346
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,110
Spike,
sure, I was disappointed,

347
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,230
But you are
my number-one assistant

348
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,130
And friend,
and you always will be.

349
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,250
It's just that sometimes
I need some help at night.

350
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,510
I can't ask you
to stay up late.

351
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,250
You're a baby dragon,
and you need your rest.

352
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,070
Owls are nocturnal,
so I asked Aloysius to help,

353
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,210
But not to take your place.

354
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,470
No one could
ever replace you, Spike,

355
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,450
Not even when you are being
a jealous numbskull.

356
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,570
I'm sorry, Twilight.

357
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,610
I never should have
been so jealous.

358
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,130
And I'm sorry, too, Spike.

359
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,910
I should have been
more sensitive.

360
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,590
And, Aloysius, I know now that
you weren't out to take my job.

361
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,190
Forgive me?

362
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,090
Hoo?

363
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,150
Me. Forgive me -- Spike.

364
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,150
Hoo!

365
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,790
He forgives you, Spike.

366
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,410
Hey, how did you guys know
where I was?

367
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,390
It was your
ketchup-Covered feet.

368
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,490
Aloysius discovered
your footprints,

369
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,130
And we followed them
all the way to the cave.

370
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,630
Oh, yeah, the ketchup.

371
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,950
It looked pretty real, though,
didn't it?

372
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,170
Uh...

373
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,670
I know princess Celestia

374
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,490
Will want to read about
what happened today.

375
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,750
I'm ready when you are.

376
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,790
Hey, Spike, why don't you
write to princess Celestia

377
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,590
And tell her
what you've learned?

378
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,590
Really?

379
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,090
Why, that's
a big responsibility.

380
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,430
I know.

381
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,190
But nothing my number-one
assistant can't handle.

382
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,130
"Dear princess Celestia...

383
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,150
"this is Spike writing to you
about my adventures.

384
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,230
"This week, I learned that
being jealous and telling lies

385
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,690
"Gets you nowhere
in friendship.

386
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,190
"I also learned

387
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,010
"That there's plenty of love
for every friend to share.

388
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,350
So from here on out, I promise
that i, Spike, will --"

389
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,810
Oh, Spike.

390
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,310
Hoo?

391
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,890
"Who?"
