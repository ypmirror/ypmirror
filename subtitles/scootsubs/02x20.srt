1
00:00:02,845 --> 00:00:05,795
I made it for you, Rarity.

2
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:09,625
Why yes, it is an ice cream house.

3
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:14,295
Chocolate fudge shingles...
Rocky road garage...

4
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:21,975
Twilight?

5
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,295
Oh, hi Spike.

6
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,695
It's the middle of the night!
Why are you pacing like this?

7
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:29,655
Frankly, I don't know how you
can sleep at a time like this!

8
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,415
Three AM?

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,895
It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!

10
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:38,195
I don't understand.
What's wrong?

11
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:40,795
Here.
Now do you see what's wrong?

12
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:44,145
You forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?

13
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:47,925
No, the problem is I just finished
planning my schedule for the month,

14
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:50,775
but I forgot to leave time to plan
for next month!

15
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:52,195
Don't you see?

16
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,905
There's no time in my schedule
to put together another schedule!

17
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,925
I could move my meeting with
the Ponyville Hay Board

18
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:58,095
to the following Tuesday,

19
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,545
but then I have to reschedule
my lunch with Pinkie Pie.

20
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:02,665
And you know what a nightmare
she is with scheduling.

21
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:06,515
This is an absolute disaster.
My whole year could be thrown off!

22
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:09,495
And I woke up from
an ice cream dream for this...

23
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:16,435


24
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:22,225


25
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:44,395


26
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,325
Oh my gosh, I think I did it!

27
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:58,155
If I can find a way to read
The Art of Invisibility Spells,

28
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:01,115
and Farmhill's A Brief History of Canterlot
at the same time,

29
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:03,685
that could leave me
a half-hour scheduling window!

30
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:10,905
What's going on?

31
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,195
Twilight,

32
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:31,595
you've got to listen to me!

33
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:32,495
Who are you?

34
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,845
I mean, you're me, but I'm me too.

35
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,175
How can there be two 'me's?

36
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,495
It's not scientifically possible.

37
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:39,555
You are not scientifically possible!

38
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:40,275
Twilight, please!

39
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:42,995
I have a very important message
for you from the future!

40
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:44,965
You're from the future?!

41
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,265
That's right, now listen-

42
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:49,615
What happened to you?
The future must be awful.

43
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,395
Please! I don't have much time!

44
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:54,395
Is there some sort of epic pony war
in the distant future or something?

45
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:57,395
Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning.
But that's not important right now!

46
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:00,325
I can't believe
time travel's really possible!

47
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:03,135
How did you, I mean, I
figure it out?

48
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:05,245
The time spells are in
the Canterlot archives.

49
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:06,845
- But that's not-
- Really? Where?

50
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:07,885
I've never seen them.

51
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,935
They're in the
Star Swirl the Bearded wing.

52
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:12,995
- Now, you have to listen to me.
- Is time travel fun, or does it hurt?

53
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:14,495
I have so many questions-

54
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:18,045
I have something extremely important
to tell you about the future.

55
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:20,515
I only have a few seconds,
so you've got to listen!

56
00:03:20,665 --> 00:03:22,045
Whatever you do, don't-

57
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,925
Future Twilight? Oh no!

58
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,835
What was she trying to warn me about?

59
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:30,935
Her clothes, her mane, that scar...

60
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,605
What a mess she is!

61
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,765
I mean, I am... or I... will be...

62
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:40,075
She must want me to prevent whatever
horrible thing happens in the future!

63
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:47,625
C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start
until the party supplies get there!

64
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:51,895
Happy to... help... but...

65
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:55,465
Can I carry... the balloons next time?

66
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:02,725
Listen, everypony! I've got
something really important to say!

67
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,375
This is no laughing matter!
We have a crisis on our hooves!

68
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,505
I've just been visited
by myself from the future!

69
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,095
This isn't a joke!

70
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:23,965
My future self tried to warn me
about a horrible disaster,

71
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:26,795
that's gonna occur sometime
before next Tuesday morning!

72
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:28,095
What kind of disaster?

73
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:29,225
I don't know!

74
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,065
I got sucked back into the future
before I could explain!

75
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:35,785
Run for your liiife!

76
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,205
Whatever should we do, Twilight?

77
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:41,395
How do we stop a disaster
if we don't know what it is?

78
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:44,105
We'll just have to work together
to make sure we're safe.

79
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:48,305
Rainbow Dash, you and the other pegasi
spread out over Equestria

80
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,025
and look for any kind of problem
that could lead to a disaster.

81
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:52,955
And I mean anything.

82
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,125
You got it!

83
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,075
Everypony else...

84
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,335
Anypony else wanna panic with me?

85
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:03,485
No?

86
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:10,045
Everypony else,
time to disaster proof Equestria!

87
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,465
Eeyup.

88
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,055
Done, and done, and done.

89
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:58,585
Applejack,
what about the Everfree Forest?

90
00:05:58,735 --> 00:05:59,735
The perimeter's clear.

91
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:00,685
Great.

92
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:04,485
And my team gave the all clear
from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.

93
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:05,525
Excellent.

94
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:08,185
Well, we've done everything on the list.

95
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,925
But still...

96
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:13,395
Future Twilight looked like
she'd been through a horrible ordeal.

97
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:16,475
I just have this nagging feeling
we should be looking for something bigger

98
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,625
than loose bolts and leaky pipes.

99
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,375
Okay, everypony.
Follow my lead.

100
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:37,975
- What is that thing?
- That's Cerberus!

101
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,575
He's supposed to be guarding
the gates of Tartarus.

102
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,975
But if he's here, then all the ancient evil
creatures that have been imprisoned there

103
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,055
could escape and destroy Equestria!

104
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,245
- Destroy Equestria?!
- Yeah, isn't it great?

105
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:53,395
Hey, Cerberus! You look like
you could use some obedience training!

106
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,705
Magic obedience training!

107
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:03,985
Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?

108
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:07,825
Wow, I knew you were good with animals,
but this is amazing.

109
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:12,725
Aw, he's just a big furry guy
who got out of his yard, that's all.

110
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,875
Right, Cerberus?

111
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:17,075
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

112
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,325
- Pinkie.
- Yes, Twilight?

113
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,795
Do you have a ball I can borrow?

114
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:26,825
I have balls stashed all over Ponyville.
In case of ball emergency.

115
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:29,295
Hey, Cerberus!

116
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:33,175
Look what I have!

117
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:36,605
I'll be back as soon as I've returned him
to the gates of Tartarus.

118
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:39,375
Once he's back at home,
there'll be no disaster.

119
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:51,575
I wish Twilight would go on
epic adventures more often.

120
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:54,375
Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.

121
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:58,385
Hey Twilight.
How'd it go with Cerberus?

122
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:02,925
Great! I got him back before any
of the evil creatures could escape.

123
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,385
Oh no!

124
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,845
What's the big deal,
it's just a 'lost dog' flyer.

125
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,475
I guess the Princess hasn't heard
we found Cerberus yet.

126
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,185
It's not that,
it's this!

127
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:18,075
A paper cut...?

128
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:20,475
Come on, Twilight,
you really need to toughen up.

129
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:23,055
Just clean it out and you'll be fine.

130
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:27,225
The cut's in the exact same spot
as the scar on future Twilight's cheek!

131
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,385
We haven't changed the future at all!

132
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:31,595
The disaster is still coming!

133
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,875
If the disaster wasn't caused
by Cerberus getting loose,

134
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,575
then what could it possibly be?

135
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:43,395
I dunno, but maybe you ought
to give the pacing a rest.

136
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,175
You've worn a groove into the floor!

137
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,525
I don't have time for another one
of your lectures, Spike!

138
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:48,675
This is serious!

139
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:50,375
My lectures?

140
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:53,325
I did everything I could think of
to change the future.

141
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,375
But it didn't work.

142
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,575
So maybe it's not what I do...

143
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:59,925
Maybe it's what I don't do!

144
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,675
If I stand right here and don't
move a muscle until next Tuesday,

145
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,045
I can't possibly do whatever it is

146
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:09,475
that future Twilight wanted
to warn me not to do!

147
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,425
Really?

148
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:17,475
So... no matter what happens,
you're not gonna move a muscle, huh?

149
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:20,875
Then maybe you won't mind if I...

150
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,105
eat an entire tub of ice cream!

151
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:36,665
So good!

152
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:40,975
Spike, stop!
Think of the stomach ache!

153
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,325
Stomach ache, huh?

154
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,495
That's future Spike's problem.

155
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:50,275
Hey, Twilight!

156
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:53,225
Another pegasus just got back
from Baltimare with an all-clear and-

157
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:58,875
What's going on?
Aren't you gonna stop him?

158
00:09:59,025 --> 00:09:59,995
She sure isn't!

159
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:02,475
In fact, she's not gonna move
'til next Tuesday!

160
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:05,625
She thinks it'll prevent
the disaster from happening!

161
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,645
Oh, this is too rich.

162
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,925
Hey Twilight!
There's a mouse right behind you!

163
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:20,475
Wait, wait, wait, let me try!

164
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,955
Oh no!

165
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:34,205
What happened?

166
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:39,255
I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to!
It was a total accident!

167
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:40,435
Show me.

168
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,235
I'm not so sure that's a-

169
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:44,125
Show me!

170
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,725
Oh no! This is the same
mane cut as future Twilight!

171
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:54,825
Y'know...
It really doesn't look too bad...

172
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:56,505
I don't care how it looks!

173
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,145
It's just another sign
that the future hasn't changed!

174
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:01,885
Not doing anything didn't work either!

175
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:05,625
I wish there was a way to know what
was going to happen so I could stop it!

176
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:07,595
You wanna see the future?

177
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:11,525
I might know somepony who can help!

178
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:13,455
What's this?

179
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:14,875
It's Madame Pinkie's place.

180
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,475
Madame Pinkie?

181
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:23,275
Come... enter the chamber
of Madame Pinkie Pie...

182
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:31,175
For the answers you seek, let us consult
the mystical orb of fate's destiny...

183
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,005
Do you like
my mystical orb of fate's destiny?

184
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:36,275
I just got it. Cool, huh?

185
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:39,355
Yeah, uh... best one I've seen.

186
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:45,855
Look deep into the crystal ball...
For soon it will reveal all!

187
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,875
Ah yes, I see something...

188
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,475
It's a vision of the future...

189
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,475
I see you, Twilight.

190
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,225
You will get...

191
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:01,205
a really cool birthday present next year!

192
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:02,455
Yes, and?

193
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,725
That's it.

194
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:05,175
Are you sure?

195
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,135
Yep. Cool birthday present.

196
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:10,235
Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense
to tell me what the impending

197
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,925
disaster is that future Twilight
was trying to warn me about!

198
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:16,975
Oh, my fortune telling has nothing to do
with my Pinkie Sense, silly.

199
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,575
It's only good for vague
and immediate events.

200
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:23,155
Like that, see?

201
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,275
Where did that even come from?

202
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,375
Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight
since the flowerpot incident.

203
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:34,825
Hope she still isn't mad.

204
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:42,045
Off by point zero two from yesterday.

205
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,465
Carry the fifteen...

206
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,875
Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...

207
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:47,025
Hey Pinkie.

208
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:49,045
Twilight's really serious about finding out

209
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:51,425
about that cool birthday present, isn't she?

210
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:54,915
Who cares?
As long as I can keep eating ice cream.

211
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,465
Sorry, future Spike.

212
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:00,655
Are you okay?

213
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,285
Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here.

214
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:05,035
Can you help me recalibrate the apertures

215
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,245
on the nine and quarter
catadioptric telescopes?

216
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,395
Sure!

217
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,375
So I was thinking...

218
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:12,535
After I came to see Madame Pinkie
and the flowerpot landed on my head,

219
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:14,655
see the bandage, just like
the bandage from the future...

220
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:15,805
Nice.

221
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,305
I had an epiphany after that flowerpot.

222
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,225
Doing things didn't work,
not doing things didn't work.

223
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,705
And I couldn't predict the future either,
so I only had one other choice...

224
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:27,525
Monitor everything.

225
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,075
Makes sense to me!

226
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:32,145
That way no matter what happens
in the future, I'll be ready!

227
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,295
I thought I saw something last night
in the Horsehead nebula.

228
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,225
But after staring at it
for three straight hours,

229
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,775
I realized I was wrong!

230
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:39,995
Three hours? But when did you sleep?

231
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:42,525
Oh I didn't sleep. I haven't slept
since future Twilight was here.

232
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:44,315
There are only three days
left until next Tuesday,

233
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,125
I can sleep all I want after that!

234
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,455
You've been awake too long, Twilight.

235
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:50,905
Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now.

236
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,555
Tuesday's tomorrow!

237
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,635
Pinkie, did you finish
recalibrating the apertures

238
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,935
on the nine and quarter inch
catadioptric telescopes?

239
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:00,925
I have no idea!

240
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,355
Ah! My eye!

241
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:07,765
Don't worry, Twilight,
I have eye patches stashed

242
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:10,705
all over Ponyville,
in case of eye patch emergency.

243
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,695
There! Now you look like a pirate.

244
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,675
A sleepy pirate,
with a really weird mane cut.

245
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,345
The eye patch...! Another sign!

246
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,175
Nearly all the signs have come true!

247
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:23,125
I haven't done a thing
to prevent the catastrophe!

248
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:25,025
If Tuesday's tomorrow,

249
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,845
and the disaster happens
by Tuesday morning,

250
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,425
then there's only one solution.

251
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:30,145
I'll just have to...

252
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,595
stop time!

253
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:46,265
Okay, the Canterlot archives
are right over there.

254
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:47,465
Let's move!

255
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:58,705
I don't think we need
to sneak around, Twilight.

256
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:01,085
It's not illegal
to walk around Canterlot.

257
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,235
Guard!

258
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,285
C'mon, you guys!

259
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:12,805
That was close.

260
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,765
I dunno why we have
to wear these things, either.

261
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,625
Aren't we wearing them for fun?

262
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,105
No, there's nothing fun about this!

263
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:23,755
- Are you sure?
- Focus, guys!

264
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,435
The only way to prevent this disaster
is to stop time!

265
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:28,905
Time spells are kept in
the Star Swirl the Bearded wing,

266
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:30,835
the most secure section of the archives.

267
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,595
That's why we're sneaking around!

268
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:35,055
Awesome!
That sounds fun!

269
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:37,005
No, it's not fun!

270
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:43,075
I still don't understand
how sneaking into the archives

271
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,005
is gonna help her find out
about her birthday present.

272
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:51,525
The coast is clear.

273
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:54,235
Now slowly lift me into the window
so we can- AH!

274
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:00,265
Let's get this over with.

275
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:26,175
Okay, if my calculations are correct,
the Star Swirl the Bearded wing

276
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,125
should be right... here.

277
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,775
Uh, Twilight?

278
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:30,725
What is it, Spike?

279
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,285
Isn't this where we came in?

280
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,265
Cool! Can we climb in the window again?

281
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:35,715
That was super fun!

282
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:39,215
I don't understand.
It's supposed to be right here...

283
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,045
How are we supposed to find it now?

284
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:44,595
Maybe we should ask somepony
in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?

285
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:47,565
Huh. How'd I miss that?

286
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,645
Look at all those
priceless magic scrolls...

287
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:53,165
There are more than I ever imagined!

288
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:54,905
Twilight, the guard!

289
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,365
What do we do, what do we do?!

290
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,315
Hey, Twilight,
haven't seen you in a while.

291
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:10,475
Let me open that for ya.

292
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:14,955
Thanks!

293
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:17,385
Oh no!

294
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,365
Look! I look just like future Twilight.

295
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:23,305
The last sign has come true!

296
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,705
And that's bad, right?

297
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:26,555
Come on!

298
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,885
It's almost Tuesday morning!
The disaster could happen at any moment!

299
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:33,965
But how do we find
the time-stopping spell?

300
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:36,015
There must be a million scrolls here!

301
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:38,735
I. Don't. Know!

302
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:02,255
Twilight, it's over!
It's officially Tuesday morning!

303
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:03,405
No!

304
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:06,395
Tuesday morning, the disaster!

305
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:09,195
Incoming!

306
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,865
I dunno, Twilight.
I don't see any disasters.

307
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,725
It looks like a pretty nice day.

308
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:21,005
Good morning, Twilight,
love the new hairstyle.

309
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:22,255
Well, happy Tuesday!

310
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:27,315
Why isn't anypony surprised
to see me sneaking around in here?!

311
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,785
Is it possible
there never was a disaster?

312
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:34,135
That I've just been making myself
frantic over nothing?!

313
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:36,095
I don't get it.

314
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,725
If future Twilight wasn't
warning you about a disaster,

315
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,675
then what was she trying to tell you?

316
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:46,205
I don't know. But I do know one thing.

317
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:48,615
I look ridiculous!

318
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,915
Yeah, you do!

319
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:52,885
And it's all because
I couldn't stop worrying

320
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,115
and let the future handle itself!

321
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:56,965
Well, not any more.

322
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,785
From now on, I'm gonna
solve problems as they come.

323
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:02,415
And stop worrying about
every little thing!

324
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:03,565
That's great!

325
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:06,105
Does that mean there won't be
any more late night pacing?

326
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:08,075
No more late night pacing.

327
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:10,605
If only I had learned
this lesson a week ago,

328
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:12,585
we wouldn't have had
to go through all this.

329
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,775
Twilight, Twilight, I found something!

330
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,525
It doesn't stop time,
but it lets you go back in time.

331
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:21,875
It says you can go back once,
and it only lasts for a few moments.

332
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,125
Does that help?

333
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:25,955
Pinkie, you're a genius!

334
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:30,255
Now I can go back and tell past Twilight
that she doesn't need to go berserk

335
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:32,675
with worry about a disaster
that's never gonna come!

336
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:42,415
Twilight,

337
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:43,715
you've got to listen to me!

338
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:44,715
Who are you?

339
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:47,065
I mean, you're me, but I'm me too.

340
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,395
How can there be two 'me's?

341
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:49,715
It's not scientifically possible.

342
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:51,775
You are not scientifically possible!

343
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:52,495
Twilight, please!

344
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:55,215
I have a very important message
for you from the future!

345
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:57,185
You're from the future?!

346
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:58,485
That's right, now listen-

347
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:01,835
What happened to you?
The future must be awful.

348
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:03,615
Please! I don't have much time!

349
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:06,615
Is there some sort of epic pony war
in the distant future or something?

350
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:09,615
Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning.
But that's not important right now!

351
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:12,545
I can't believe
time travel's really possible!

352
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:15,355
How did you, I mean, I figure it out?

353
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,465
The time spells are in
the Canterlot archives.

354
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,065
- But that's not-
- Really? Where?

355
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:20,105
I've never seen them.

356
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:22,155
They're in the
Star Swirl the Bearded wing.

357
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:25,215
- Now, you have to listen to me.
- Is time travel fun, or does it hurt?

358
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:26,715
I have so many questions-

359
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:30,265
I have something extremely important
to tell you about the future.

360
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:32,735
I only have a few seconds,
so you've got to listen!

361
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:34,265
Whatever you do, don't...

362
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:38,575
waste your time... worrying... about...

363
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,045
I can't believe I just did that.

364
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:44,735
Did you tell her about
the cool birthday present?

365
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:47,985
Remember last week when future Twilight
came to warn me about something?

366
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:52,125
That was me trying to warn myself
not to worry so much!

367
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,795
Now I'm gonna spend the next week
freaking out about a disaster

368
00:20:55,945 --> 00:20:57,345
that doesn't even exist!

369
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:02,575
Don't worry about it.
It's past Twilight's problem now.

370
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,575
Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie.

371
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,325
Oh... my stomach...

372
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,535
I think it's all that ice cream...

373
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:17,905
I thought the stomach ache
would be future Spike's problem...

374
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:21,045
But now I am future Spike.

375
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:27,855
Come on, future Spike.

376
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:31,375
Let's get you home.
