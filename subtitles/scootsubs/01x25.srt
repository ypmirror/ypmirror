1
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,890
Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie.

2
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,930
* this is
your singing telegram *

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,190
* I hope it finds you well

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,670
* you're invited to a party

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,210
* 'cause we think
you're really swell *

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,830
* Gummy's turning 1 year old

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,290
* so help us celebrate

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,550
* the cake will be delicious

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,290
* the festivities first-Rate

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,250
* there will be games
and dancing *

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,790
* bob for apples, cut a rug

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,110
* and when the party's over

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,970
* we'll gather 'round
for a group hug *

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,330
* no need to bring a gift

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,150
* being there will be enough

16
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,230
* birthdays mean
having fun with friends *

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,290
* not getting lots of stuff

18
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,170
* it won't be the same
without you *

19
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,490
* so we hope that you say yes

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,950
* so please,
oh, please R.S.V.P. *

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,890
* and come and be our guest

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,920
Next time I think I'll just pass
out written invitations.

we have muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,470
Nice one!

25
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,330
Now let me show you
how it's really done.

26
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,790
Hey, girls!

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,350
Hey, Pinkie Pie.

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,310
Howdy.

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,450
Just wanted to tell you
how happy I am

30
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,730
That you could make it
to Gummy's party!

31
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,410
Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

32
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,830
Me neither.

33
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,710
When Pinkie Pie throws a party,
I am there!

34
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,650
Ta-Da!

35
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,430
Aww, just a boring old apple.
Don't worry.

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,230
There are plenty
of other surprises in there.

37
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,930
What kind of surprises?

38
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,770
I can't tell you that,
silly!

39
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,150
Then it wouldn't be
a surprise!

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,850
Ugh!

41
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,390
This punch
is simply divine.

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,150
Is this
the same recipe you used

43
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,890
For your
spring-Has-Sprung party?

44
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,430
Nope, something new.

45
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,850
It's Gummy's favorite!

46
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,670
Ooh!
This is my jam!

47
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,770
Having fun?

48
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,970
A blast.

49
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,110
You always throw the best
parties, Pinkie Pie.

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,710
They're always
the best parties

51
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,430
'Cause my best friends
are always there.

52
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,810
Aah!
Oh!

53
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,310
Come on, everybody!

54
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,850
Gummy wants to dance!

55
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,150
Go, Gummy!
It's your birthday!

56
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,990
Go, Gummy!
It's your birthday!

57
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,970
Whoo-Whee!
I am beat.

58
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,670
I haven't danced
that much since --

59
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,370
Well, since
your last party.

60
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,910
Thanks again for the invite.

61
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,430
See you later,
birthday alligator!

62
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,950
Bravo for hosting yet another
delightful soirée.

63
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,270
It's been lovely.

64
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,730
you sure you don't want
to stay?

65
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,170
There's still some cake left.

66
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,830
Uh, I think
I'm gonna pass.

67
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,990
Great party, though.
We should do this again soon.

68
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,110
We should do this again soon!

69
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,370
Oh, hi, Pinkie.

70
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,430
It's soon!

71
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,290
Pardon me?

72
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,070
You said we should have another
party soon, and it's soon.

73
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,930
Here's your invitation.

74
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,310
"You're invited to Gummy's
after-Birthday party

75
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,350
This afternoon at 3:00."

76
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,310
All our bestest friends
are invited,

77
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,270
And there's gonna be
dancing and games and cake
and ice cream and punch!

78
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,050
This afternoon?

79
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,950
As in this afternoon
this afternoon?

80
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,310
Yes, indeedy!

81
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,910
Oh, gosh.

82
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,430
I wish I could make it,

83
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,770
But I've gotten a bit behind
in my studies.

84
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,190
I really got
to hit the books.

85
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,810
I understand.
Your studies come first.

86
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,650
But don't worry. We'll be sure
to save you some cake.

87
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,030
Please do.

88
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,910
Oh, and, Twilight,
you shouldn't hit the books.

89
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,450
You should really
just read them.

90
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,850
I'll keep that in mind.

91
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,350
Huh?

92
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,650
Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie.

93
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,490
What brings you
'round these parts?

94
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,750
Who's ready to shake
their hoof-Thang?

95
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,210
It's an invitation to Gummy's
after-Birthday party

96
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:07,930
This afternoon.

97
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,210
There's gonna be dancing
and games

98
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,730
And cake and ice cream
and punch!

99
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,950
This afternoon?

100
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,310
As in this afternoon
this afternoon?

101
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,890
That's funny.
That's just what Twilight said.

102
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,610
And the answer is, yes,
it's this afternoon.

103
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,610
Oh.

104
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,370
Well, I -- Uh, I don't think
I can make it,

105
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,270
'Cause I have to, uh...

106
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,830
uh, you know what?

107
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,650
Uh, uh, pick apples!

108
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,950
Yep, apples, 'cause that's
what we do with, uh, apples.

109
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,330
We, uh, pick them.

110
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,890
Okie-Dokie-Lokie!

111
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,250
A party is
still a party,

112
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,690
Even if there are
only three guests.

113
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,670
Whew!

114
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,270
Anything else I can do for you,
most beautiful one?

115
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,510
Perhaps you could
take a bath.

116
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,790
How do I put this
delicately?

117
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,810
You smell like
a rotten apple core

118
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,170
That's been wrapped
in moldy hay

119
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,590
And dipped
in dragon perspiration.

120
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,410
Ooh, love the new hat.
Very modern.

121
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,370
What's the occasion?

122
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,730
Gummy's after-Birthday party
is this afternoon.

123
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,170
I'm delivering
the invitations.

124
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,710
The party
is this afternoon?

125
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,690
As in this afternoon
this afternoon?

126
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,410
It's so strange.
Everypony keeps saying that.

127
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,130
Oh. Do they?

128
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,590
I know
it's short notice,

129
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,530
But we had such a great time
at his birthday party,

130
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,030
I thought we could have
even more fun

131
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,070
At his
after-Birthday party.

132
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,150
And I'm sure
that we would,

133
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,490
But I'm going
to have to decline.

134
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,590
I have to...wash my hair.

135
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,330
Don't be silly.
Your hair doesn't look dirty.

136
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,450
It doesn't?
Nope.

137
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,590
See?

138
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,350
Dirty.

139
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,670
I have to go.

140
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,730
Huh.

141
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,750
No Twilight, no Applejack,
no Rarity.

142
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,090
Oh, well.

143
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,690
A party is still a party,
even with only two guests.

144
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,410
This afternoon?

145
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,850
As in --
Yes!

146
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,090
As in this afternoon
this afternoon!

147
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,070
Oh, man, we'd love to,

148
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,850
But we're...house-Sitting
this afternoon.

149
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,610
both of you?

150
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,170
It's, uh, a big house.

151
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,610
Uh, look at the time!

152
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,890
We'd really better
get going.

153
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,390
Wait!

154
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,410
Maybe I could bring you

155
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,890
Some after-Birthday cake
and ice cream!

156
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,630
Who are you
house-Sitting for?

157
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,190
Harry.
Harry?

158
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,670
Yeah. I don't think
you know him.

159
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,690
That's strange.

160
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,510
I know just about everypony
around here.

161
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,110
He's...a bear.
A bear?

162
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,030
Yep. He's a bear,
all right.

163
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,570
And he'll be pretty upset

164
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,850
If we don't get over
to his house soon.

165
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,410
Wait!

166
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,990
There's a bear around here
who lives in a house?

167
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,510
It's, uh,
really more of a cave.

168
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,690
But he's fixed
the place up so much,
it feels like a house.

169
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,250
And, uh, he wants us
to look after his house --

170
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,870
Uh, cave --
While he's, uh...

171
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,790
a-At the beach.

172
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,390
He's vacationing
at the beach?

173
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,390
Yep. He loves to...

174
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,250
collect seashells!
Play beach volleyball!

175
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,230
Play beach volleyball!
Collect seashells!

176
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,770
Collect volleyballs!
Play seashells!

177
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,550
Got to go!

178
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,310
Something strange is definitely
going on around here, Gummy.

179
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,930
Sure, Rainbow Dash
and Fluttershy

180
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,630
Had to house-Sit
for that vacationing bear,

181
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,650
But what are the chances
all my other friends

182
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,150
Would have plans
this afternoon, too?

183
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,370
Rarity has to wash her hair?

184
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,010
Applejack has to pick apples?

185
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,630
Twilight is
behind on her studies

186
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,830
And has to hit the books?

187
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,870
The more I think about it,

188
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,150
The more those are starting
to sound like...

189
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,210
...excuses!

190
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,450
That doesn't look
like studying...

191
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,910
or hitting.

192
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,690
Oh, you must be
here for --

193
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,250
Shh!

194
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,770
Is Pinkie Pie around?

195
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,730
Oh, I don't think so.
Good.

196
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,250
I don't want her to know
anything about this.

197
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,870
Yes, of course.
I'll be right back.

198
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,810
But we're friends.

199
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,510
What wouldn't Twilight want me
to know anything about?

200
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,890
She's coming back.

201
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,210
There you go.

202
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,350
Thanks. And remember,
not a word to Pinkie Pie.

203
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,250
Hey.

204
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,550
What's with the tin can?

205
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,250
Aah!

206
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,470
Time to get
to the bottom of things.

207
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,470
I think our cover's been blown.

208
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,450
We'll need
a new disguise.

209
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,270
She didn't see you
at the sweet shop, did she?

210
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,670
I don't think so.

211
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,470
Oh, good. I'd hate for her
to ruin everything.

212
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,770
Me too.

213
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,430
Have you seen her?

214
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,490
Not since this morning.

215
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,750
Me neither.

216
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,750
Can you believe she was
planning on throwing

217
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,410
An after-Birthday party
today?

218
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,810
I'm just glad I was able
to come up with an excuse

219
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,830
For why I couldn't
be there.

220
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,090
Me too. This is obviously
going to be so much better.

221
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,770
As long as we keep her

222
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,190
From finding out about it,
it will.

223
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,650
See you later.

224
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,310
Oh!

225
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,050
Oh!

226
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,630
Aah!

227
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,750
I thought everypony
loved my parties.

228
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,530
Hi, Pinkie Pie.

229
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,410
Uh-Oh!

230
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,590
Rainbow Dash, wait!

231
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:43,850
Whew!

232
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,830
Where are you going?!
Aah!

233
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,190
What's the real reason

234
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,130
You didn't want
to come to Gummy's party?!

235
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,170
What's in that bag?!

236
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,450
Applejack, we have a problem!

237
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,830
I know you're in there!

238
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,870
Oh, uh, howdy, partner.

239
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,930
Mind if I take a look
inside the barn?

240
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,450
No.

241
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,410
Uh, I mean yes.

242
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,810
I mean
you can't come in here.

243
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,530
Rainbow Dash
just went in there.

244
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,150
Oh, well, she was just bringing
in some...supplies, yep.

245
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,210
Supplies
for the r-Renovation.

246
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,310
Fixing up the whole thing,
top to bottom.

247
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,610
Uh, lots of construction
going on in there right now!

248
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,910
You heard her!
Construction!

249
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,490
Yep, construction.

250
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,110
That's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

251
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,850
Okie-Dokie-Lokie.

252
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,430
Secrets and lies.

253
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,730
It's all secrets and lies
with those ponies.

254
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,570
They're up to something, Gummy,

255
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,410
Something they don't want me
to know about.

256
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,010
Well, I'm gonna know
about it!

257
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,770
I'm gonna know about it
big time!

258
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,970
And I know just who's
gonna tell me all about it --

259
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,270
Tell me all about it
big time!

260
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,810
Wow! Nice spread.

261
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,730
It's all yours, Spike.

262
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,650
All you have to do
is talk.

263
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,150
That's it?
Oh, you got it.

264
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,250
Okay. Uh, beautiful weather
we're having, eh?

265
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,490
I love a sunny spring day.
Don't you?

266
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,150
The birds chirping,
the flowers blooming.

267
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,710
No, no, no.
Talk about our friends.

268
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,450
Oh, okay.
Let's see.

269
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,650
There's Twilight Sparkle.
She's the unicorn.

270
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,750
Good with magic,
real brainiac.

271
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,330
And then you got Rarity --
Total knockout.

272
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,170
Twilight seems to think
I don't have a chance with her,

273
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,310
But, eh,
what does she know?

274
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,930
Let's see.

275
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,290
There's -- There's Fluttershy,
a pegasus afraid of heights.

276
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,410
Huh!
What's up with that?
Ugh! No!

277
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,710
You're not
understanding me!

278
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,570
I want you to confess!

279
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,010
Confess?
Confess!

280
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,850
I'm the one who spilled juice
all over Twilight's copy

281
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,650
Of "magical mysteries
and practical potions"!

282
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,690
And?

283
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,530
And I'm the one who used up

284
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,990
All the hot water
in Ponyville yesterday

285
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,350
When I took
a seven-Hour bubble bath!

286
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,310
And?

287
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,130
And sometimes, when no one's
around, I do this.

288
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,310
Lookin' good, Spike!

289
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,870
Lookin' real good!

290
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,870
No, no, no, no!

291
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,390
W-What do you want
to hear?

292
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,290
Tell me what you want me to say,
and I'll say it!

293
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,790
Tell me that my friends are
lying to me and avoiding me

294
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,910
Because they don't
like my parties

295
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,970
And they don't want to
be my friends anymore!

296
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,330
Your friends are all lying
to you and avoiding you

297
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,230
'Cause they don't
like your parties

298
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,550
And they don't want to
be your friends anymore!

299
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,850
Aha! I knew it!

300
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,310
Oh, no!

301
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,870
My friends don't
like my parties,

302
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,910
And they don't want to
be me friends anymore.

303
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,830
uh, so...

304
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,510
aw!

305
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,710
Mm-Mmm!

306
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,350
Mm-Mmm!

307
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,250
Thank you all
so much for coming.

308
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,890
It means so much to Gummy.

309
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,150
could I have some more punch?

310
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,970
well, of course you can have
some more punch, Mr. Turnip.

311
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,870
this is one great party!

312
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,950
You've really outdone yourself!

313
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,790
why, thank you, Rocky.

314
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,350
I'm having a
delightful time, as well.

315
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,730
I'm so glad, sir Lints-A-Lot.

316
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,230
might I trouble you for
another slice of cake?

317
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,650
anything for you,
Madame le Flour.

318
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,950
I'm just glad none of them
ponies showed up.

319
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,130
Oh, they're not so bad.

320
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,130
Not so bad? Please.

321
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,190
They're a bunch of losers.

322
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,030
Oh, come on, now.

323
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,890
"Losers" might be a little
strong, don't you think?

324
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,970
After the way
they treated you?

325
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,790
I say "losers"
isn't strong enough.

326
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,150
Well, it was pretty rude.

327
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,890
Pretty rude?
It was downright despicable!

328
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,550
It was, wasn't it?

329
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,590
If I were you, I wouldn't
speak to them ever again.

330
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,990
You know what?

331
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,930
I'm not gonna speak to them
ever again,

332
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,690
And I'm not gonna invite them
to another party

333
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,630
As long as I live!

334
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,830
They don't deserve to be
invited to my parties!

335
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,910
Not after the way
they've been acting.

336
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,950
Despicable!
Bunch of losers!

337
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,290
Yes, that's right!

338
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,630
Well done.

339
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,990
Yeah, you show them!

340
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,450
Who could that be?

341
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,230
Hey there, Pinkie Pie.

342
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,570
Sorry I was in
such a rush earlier.

343
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,670
Had someplace to be and couldn't
slow down and say hello.

344
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,070
You know how it goes.

345
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,690
I know how it goes,
all right.

346
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,930
Yeah.

347
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,690
So, why don't you come with me
over to sweet apple acres?

348
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,030
No, thanks. I'm spending time
with my real friends.

349
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,110
Isn't that right,
Madame le Flour?

350
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,610
Oui! That is correct, madame.

351
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,030
Uh, Pinkie Pie?

352
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,050
another slice of cake,
sir Lints-A-Lot?

353
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,490
I'd love one.

354
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,270
All righty.

355
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,010
What do you say we get on
out of creepy town

356
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,190
And head over
to Applejack's --

357
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,890
She's not
going anywhere.

358
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,410
I most certainly am not.

359
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,270
I'm having a wonderful time
right here.

360
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,350
You should really
just come with me.

361
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,730
You heard the lady!

362
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,510
She ain't goin' nowheres,
chump!

363
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,270
Who you callin'
a chump, chump?

364
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,470
That's it.
Party's over.

365
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,970
Come on, Pinkie Pie.
No!

366
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,030
Pinkie Pie, let's go!
I said no!

367
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,390
You...have to...
come with...me!

368
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,710
No...i...don't!

369
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,250
Oh, you want to do this
the hard way?

370
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,930
We'll do this
the hard way!

371
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,310
We're...here.

372
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,110
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!

373
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,050
I really thought
she'd be more excited.

374
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,070
Excited?! Excited?!

375
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,370
Why would I be excited to attend
my own farewell party?!

376
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,370
Farewell party?

377
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,250
Yes!

378
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,430
You don't like me anymore,

379
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,910
So you decided to kick me
out of the group

380
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,930
And throw a great big party
to celebrate,

381
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,950
A-Farewell-To-Pinkie Pie
party!

382
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,510
Why in the world
would you think

383
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,090
We didn't like you anymore,
sugar cube?

384
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,230
Why?

385
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,890
Why?!

386
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,870
Why?!
Oh!

387
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,170
Because you've been lying to me
and avoiding me all day!

388
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,750
That's why!

389
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,450
Uh, yeah, because we wanted
your party to be a surprise.

390
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,690
We've been planning this party
for such a long time.

391
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,270
We had to make excuses for why
we couldn't attend Gummy's party

392
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,170
So that we could get
everything ready for yours.

393
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,190
If this is
a farewell party,

394
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,550
Why does the cake I picked up
from sugar cube corner

395
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,930
Say "happy birthday,
Pinkie Pie"?

396
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,030
Because it's my birthday!

397
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,670
Oh, how could I have forgotten
my own birthday?

398
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,330
And you like me so much,

399
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,330
You decided to throw me
a surprise party!

400
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,330
That's what we've been trying
to tell you, darling.

401
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,150
You girls are
the best friends ever!

402
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,710
How could I have
ever doubted you?

403
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,650
It's okay, Pinkie Pie.

404
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,670
It could've happened
to any of us.

405
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,390
Don't worry
about it.

406
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,690
I'm just glad I haven't been
replaced by a bucket of turnips.

407
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,190
Huh?
You don't want
to know.

408
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,230
All right, girls.
Enough of this gabbin'.

409
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,850
Let's party!

410
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,710
Dear princess Celestia,

411
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,870
I am writing to you from
the most delightful party.

412
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,870
I am not only having a great
time with my friends

413
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,730
But also was given
the opportunity

414
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,910
To learn a valuable lesson
about friendship.

415
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,650
Always expect the best
from your friends

416
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,270
And never assume the worst.

417
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,250
Rest assured that a good friend

418
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,410
Always has your best interests
at heart.

419
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,090
Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle.

420
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,070
You girls wouldn't mind
if we celebrated

421
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,990
Gummy's after-Birthday party,
too, would you?

422
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,750
His party was cut short,
and he's pretty upset about it.

423
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,350
Oh, sure!
Oh, definitely.

424
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,890
We must have a party.

425
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,570
Let's have a party
for Gummy.
