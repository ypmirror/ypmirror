1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,870
Where'd I put that?

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,760
Oh, I thought I already --

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,010
Oh, and I can't forget
I've got to --

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,090
Ohh!

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,170
How am I ever
gonna get this done?

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,150
Are you sure
I can't help?

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,940
I could --

8
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,470
No!

9
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,420
Maybe just a --

10
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,070
No, thanks!

11
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,140
How about --
Just stand over there.

12
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:16,670
But --

13
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,490
Where you'll be
out of the way.

14
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,960
Ribbon, ribbon --
where's the ribbon?!

15
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,350
I got it!

16
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,670
Whoa!

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,660
Aah!

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,330
Um...

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,730
I-i'll just go
and stand over there,

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,330
Where I'll be...
Out of the way.

22
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,350
Won't you at least let me
help you clean up?

23
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,940
No. You've helped me
quite enough.

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,710
I'm sorry, sis.

25
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,620
I just thought that
if I could help,

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,480
I might find my special gift
and finally earn my Cutie Mark.

27
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,750
I understand.

28
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,730
It's just that... I need this
time to fill this order

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,100
Without any...
Complications.

30
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,550
Okay, all done.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,830
Now, back to work.

32
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,050
I've lost a lot of time,

33
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,050
And I cannot have
any more interruptions.

34
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,950
Oh, what now?!

35
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,350
Oh, sorry.

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,980
I thought the "open" sign
meant you were open,

37
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,890
But I must have been
mistaken.

38
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,990
Fluttershy, forgive me.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,470
I was so wrapped up
in my work

40
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,670
that I forgot you were bringing
Opalescence back

41
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,550
from her grooming.

42
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,500
No worries, Rarity.

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,840
I've left her there
in the basket.

44
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,470
Oh, she looks great!

45
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,250
I just don't understand
how you're able to do it.

46
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,250
I can't get near her without
getting a swipe from her claws.

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,170
Aah!

48
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,940
Did you use...

49
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,620
"The Stare" on her?

50
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,650
Oh, no. I wouldn't.

51
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,590
I couldn't!

52
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,990
I-i don't really have any
control over when that happens,

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,380
i-it just happens.

54
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,570
No, I'm just good
with animals.

55
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,200
It's my special gift,
you know?

56
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,790
Well, you should have a picture
of Opal as a Cutie Mark

57
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,390
instead of
those butterflies.

58
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

59
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,150
Ooh, ooh!

60
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,430
Maybe I can be good
with animals, too!

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,650
Or not.

62
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,930
I'm sorry I can't invite you
to stay and chat, Fluttershy.

63
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,520
I've bitten off a bit more
than I can chew with this order.

64
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,900
But you're not eating
anything.

65
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,510
No, Sweetie,
it's an expression.

66
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,160
It means that I've taken on
more work than I can handle.

67
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,660
I've got 20 of these
special robes to make tonight.

68
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,250
They're due in Trottingham
tomorrow morning.

69
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,570
See? I've lined them
in a special gold silk.

70
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,230
It took so long to make,

71
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,650
But I think it adds
just the right touch, don't you?

72
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,940
These are lovely,
but 20 by tonight?

73
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,660
How will you
get it all done?

74
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,190
Well, I, uh...

75
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,820
Oh, oh, oh!
Maybe I could... just --

76
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,980
Just stand over here
and watch.

77
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,590
I'll manage.

78
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,490
Well, maybe I should get out
of your mane so you can work.

79
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,170
Hi, Fluttershy!

80
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,310
Hi, Rarity!

81
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,520
Hello, uh, girls.

82
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,980
Hey, Sweetie Belle!

83
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,980
Scootaloo!
Apple Bloom!

84
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,260
You ready
for tonight?

85
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,990
Yep. Cutie mark
planning session is a go!

86
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,800
Tonight is the night
we each try to find

87
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
our own special talent.

88
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,140
Even if it takes us
all night!

89
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,650
I'm ready.
You ready?

90
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,860
Very ready.

91
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,850
Cutie Mark Crusaders'
sleepover at Rarity's!

92
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,690
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,050
And...
Look what I made us!

94
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,540
Whoa!
Wow!

95
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,620
That's so cool!

96
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,650
What does that patch
on your cape mean?

97
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,340
The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

98
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,120
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

99
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,170
We're on a crusade,
a mission...

100
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,700
To find
our Cutie Marks.

101
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,390
Yep, and look --

102
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,650
I lined them
with this special gold silk.

103
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,430
It took so long to make,

104
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,750
But I think it adds
just the right touch, don't you?

105
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,510
Oooh.

106
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,270
Aah!

107
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,270
Sweetie Belle,
what have you done?!

108
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,350
That was the last
of the gold silk!

109
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,160
Oh, now I'll have to make more!

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,990
Oh, I hope I can make more.

111
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,260
I'm gonna have to work
all night, which means --

112
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,560
Sorry, girls.

113
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,180
I'm afraid the Crusaders'
sleepover is canceled.

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,350
What?!

115
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,980
I just won't have any time
to watch you

116
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,080
if I want to get these robes
delivered on time.

117
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,390
But --
No "buts" this time.

118
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,230
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle.
It's just the way it has to be.

119
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,780
Aw!
Aw!
Aw!

120
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,260
I, uh -- I suppose I could
take them for the night.

121
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,700
I couldn't ask you
to do that.

122
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,390
Oh, it's no problem
at all.

123
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,500
Have you met my sister
and her friends?

124
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,270
A problem
is all it would be.

125
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,570
Did I have a problem
with Opal?

126
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,180
You've seen how well
I handle small creatures.

127
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,420
I suppose that's true,

128
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,170
And I do have
a lot of work to do.

129
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,580
Come on.
It'll be fun.

130
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,430
I assure you,
they're quite a handful.

131
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,330
These sweet
little angels?

132
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,410
Well...

133
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,270
All right.

134
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,390
Cutie Mark Crusaders' sleepover

135
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,250
At Fluttershy's cottage!

136
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,230
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

137
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,700
So cute.

138
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,510
Wait for me!

139
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,320
Ohh.

140
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,320
Oh, won't this be
ever so fun?

141
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,370
We can have
a nice little tea party,

142
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,000
and braid each other's tails,

143
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,050
and sit quietly and colour,

144
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,110
and tell each other
fairy tales and...

145
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,110
Hello, Fluttershy.

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,290
Oh, hello, Twilight.
Where are you off to?

147
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,620
I'm heading to the
Everfree Forest to Zecora's

148
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,290
to get some of
my favourite tea.

149
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,610
The -- the Everfree Forest?

150
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,110
Uh, you'll be careful,
won't you?

151
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,910
Of course.
How about you?

152
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,220
What are you doing
with the girls?

153
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,510
Rarity has a big order
to fill tonight,

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,150
so I volunteered
to take the girls

155
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,960
over to my cottage
for a sleepover.

156
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,420
Wow. Sounds like everypony
has their hooves full today.

157
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,530
Taking care of those
three fillies all by yourself --

158
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,060
You sure
you can handle it?

159
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,730
What?
These sweet little angels?

160
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,640
They'll be no problem at all.

161
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,410
Wow, look at this place!
What's that?!

162
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,310
No...problem at all.

163
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,470
Okay, girls.
Uh, what should we do?

164
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,350
I'm gonna get
my Mark first!

165
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,490
Girls...
Nuh-uh!

166
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
...should we...
I am!

167
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,020
G-girls,
okay, now, settle.

168
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,620
I'm staying up
all night!

169
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,910
Me too!
Me three!

170
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,310
Uh, I know
you're excited,

171
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,970
But, girls...

172
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,550
Oh. Oh, careful
with the -- oh.

173
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,880
Girls.

174
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,260
So, what do you want to do --
play a game?

175
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,550
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

176
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,140
And we want to crusade
for our Cutie Marks!

177
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,860
Um, and -- and we --

178
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,410
Um, yeah,
what they said!

179
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,400
Mm, I don't know.

180
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,430
How about a nice, quiet,
little tea party?

181
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,700
Or...

182
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,420
We could go adventuring
in the Everfree Forest!

183
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,710
Yeah!
Yeah!

184
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,770
Oh, no.

185
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,440
The Everfree Forest
is much too dangerous.

186
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,300
It's filled with far too many
strange creatures.

187
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,430
But you could go
with us,

188
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,170
and we could catch
those creatures.

189
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,740
We could be, um,
creature catchers!

190
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,240
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

191
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,120
Cutie Mark Crusader
creature catchers!

192
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,110
Rarrr!

193
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,330
I am a dangerous creature
from the Everfree Forest!

194
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,630
Rarrr!

195
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,530
Halt, dangerous creature
of the Everfree Forest.

196
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,770
I'm Sweetie Belle,
the creature catcher,

197
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,270
and I'm here to catch you!

198
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,400
You can never catch me!

199
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,430
I am far too powerful
and dangerous!

200
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,280
You cannot run from me!

201
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,750
Rarrr!

202
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,430
Rarrr!

203
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,700
Um...oh, maybe
that's not such a --

204
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,400
Now, girls, how about we do
some nice colouring?

205
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,250
No!

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,890
Come back, dangerous creature,
so I can catch you!

207
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,750
Never!

208
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,030
careful...

209
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,270
...you don't...

210
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,990
...break anything.

211
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,050
Sorry, Fluttershy.

212
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,510
Yeah, sorry.

213
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,100
I guess we aren't
creature catchers.

214
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,180
Oh, girls, it's okay.
I --

215
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,610
I know! We could be Cutie Mark
Crusader carpenters!

216
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,250
Carpenters?

217
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,010
Hammer.

218
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:09,760
Hammer.

219
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,460
Hammer.

220
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,370
Hammer.

221
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,110
Hammer.

222
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:17,820
Hammer.

223
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,020
Um, that doesn't look like
a table.

224
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,760
We were making a table?

225
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,730
Somepony needs to put this thing
out of its misery.

226
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,570
We are definitely not
Cutie Mark Carpenters.

227
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,160
Who wants a picture of a hammer
on their flank, anyway?

228
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,310
Well, now that we've
gotten that out of the way,

229
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,560
how about a game?

230
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,820
A game?

231
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,370
It's called "shh!"

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,620
What's that?

233
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,790
Well, it's a game about
who can be quiet the longest.

234
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,660
Sound fun?

235
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,060
I'm the world champ,
you know?

236
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,490
I bet you can't beat me!

237
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,620
I lose!
Me too!
Me three!

238
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,570
Okay,
now what can we do?

239
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,050
Oh! How about Cutie Mark
Crusader coal miners?

240
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,170
Yeah!
Yeah!

241
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,060
No!

242
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,760
Aw!
Aw!
Aw!

243
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,540
I mean, it's time for bed,
don't you think?

244
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,850
Aren't you excited
to get all toasty and warm

245
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,230
in your snuggly-wuggly
little beds?

246
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,110
Snuggly-wuggly?

247
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,070
But we have
more crusading to do.

248
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,820
We've got plans.

249
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,330
And capes!

250
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,790
uh, okay.

251
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,540
Um, maybe the crusading can wait
until morning,

252
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,420
or when it's light
and not so... dark?

253
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,000
How are we gonna find
our special talent

254
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,700
in our sleep?

255
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,950
Maybe you'll have
a lovely little dream

256
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,310
about your special talent.

257
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,050
But we're not even tired.

258
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,320
How about
I sing you a lullaby?

259
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,450
Mm-hmm!
Yeah!

260
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,210
* Hush now, quiet now. *

261
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,840
* It's time
to lay your sleepy head. *

262
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,170
* Hush now, quiet now. *

263
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,050
* It's time to go
to bed. *

264
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,330
I know this one!

265
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,380
Oh, how wonderful!

266
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,070
Why don't you sing it
with me?

267
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,060
* Hush now, quiet now! *

268
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,030
* It's time to lay
your sleepy head! *

269
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,960
* I said hush now, quiet now! *

270
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,720
* It's time to go to bed! *

271
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,060
Okay, Sweetie,
that was --

272
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,690
* Driftin' off to sleep, *

273
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,790
* the exciting day behind you! *

274
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,570
* Driftin' off to sleep, *

275
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,430
* let the joy of daylight
find you! *

276
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,640
Thank you, sweetie.
I'm --

277
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,580
* Hush now, quiet now! *

278
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,250
* Lay your sleepy head! *

279
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,090
* I said hush now, quiet now! *

280
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,170
* It's time to go
to be-e-e-e-e-e-d! *

281
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,830
Ow!

282
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,730
What is that?

283
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,130
Girls!

284
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,090
Fluttershy, your chickens
are on the loose!

285
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,320
I wonder
what could have caused that.

286
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,270
Don't worry,
Fluttershy.

287
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,540
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
will handle this.

288
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,160
Cutie Mark Crusader
chicken herders!

289
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,490
Yeah!
No, I don't think that's a --

290
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,410
Uh, come back.

291
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,700
Please!

292
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,670
Come on, girls.
The chickens are fine.

293
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,310
Oh, girls. Oh.

294
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,110
Girls!

295
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,470
Come on.

296
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,590
In you go.

297
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,030
There's some good
chickens.

298
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,780
Okay. You three --

299
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,940
Isn't it about time
you got into bed?

300
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,550
But --
But --
But --

301
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,030
Please?

302
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,170
So, no more crusading
for tonight, all right?

303
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,550
Yes,
Fluttershy.

304
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,910
We promise,
Fluttershy.

305
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,210
Good night,
Fluttershy.

306
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,270
Okay, good night.

307
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,110
Okay, so what kind of crusading
do we do next?

308
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,340
There's not much
we can do from this room...

309
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,700
Unless we become Cutie Mark
Crusader cottage cleaners.

310
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,130
No, thanks.

311
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,370
Well, we have to think
of something.

312
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,250
We can't just waste
this opportunity

313
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,230
to find out
what our special talents are.

314
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,320
Hey, girls!

315
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:23,900
Look!

316
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,480
Some of the chickens
may have escaped...

317
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,860
Into the forest.

318
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,720
Cutie Mark Crusaders
chicken rescuers are go!

319
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,720
It really wasn't
that hard.

320
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,630
I mean,
all I needed to do

321
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,150
was just show them
who's in charge.

322
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,110
Nothing's gonna get past
Fluttershy --

323
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,950
Good with animals,
good with kids.

324
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,540
Wait up!

325
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,270
Mm, peace and quiet.

326
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,720
Too quiet.

327
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,060
Girls?

328
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,900
Girls?

329
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,160
Elizabeak!
She's missing!

330
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,070
Girls?

331
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,660
Oh, no!

332
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,690
They must have gone looking
for my missing chicken,

333
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,030
which means
they must have gone into...

334
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,370
The Everfree Forest!

335
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,860
Those girls
have really done it this time.

336
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,030
They've really bitten off
more than they can chew...

337
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,980
Oh, just like me.

338
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,510
I never should have offered
to watch them.

339
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,910
Here, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick!

340
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,110
What are you doing?

341
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,980
Calling
for the chicken.

342
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,250
That is not how you call
a chicken.

343
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,610
Oh, and you know how
to call a chicken?

344
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,630
I know
that's not the way.

345
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,790
Then show me.

346
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,450
I don't have to
show you.

347
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,520
You're just chicken.

348
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,900
Am not!

349
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,740
Oh, wait! Now I know
how to call a chicken.

350
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,630
"Scootaloo!
Scoot, Scootaloo!"

351
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,000
That's so funny,
I forgot to laugh.

352
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,850
You also forgot
how to call a chicken.

353
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,330
Why, you --
pbht!

354
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,690
Come on, guys.

355
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,490
We're not gonna find the chicken
or our Cutie Marks

356
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,650
by arguing.

357
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,960
Maybe that's
our special talent -- arguing.

358
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,860
Is not!
Is too!

359
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,690
Is not!
Is too!

360
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,980
Anything yet?
No.

361
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:37,990
Darn.

362
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,790
Here, chick, chick,
chick, chick!

363
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,970
Girls?

364
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,280
Girls?

365
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,380
Get ahold of yourself,
Fluttershy.

366
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,880
Just put one hoof
in front of the other.

367
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,030
Aah!

368
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,020
What was that?!

369
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,470
Aaah!

370
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,100
Twilight?

371
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,530
Is that you?

372
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,370
Oh, Twilight,
it is you.

373
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,770
Thank goodness you're here.
I need your help.

374
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,080
The girls are out here
somewhere, and I'm
afraid that they're...

375
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,120
W-what's happened to you?!

376
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,020
Oh!

377
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,580
Oh, no!

378
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,460
If you've been turned to stone,
it must mean --

379
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,180
Oh!
Oh, no! The girls!

380
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,580
Don't move.
I'll be back for you.

381
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,940
Girls!

382
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,360
Is not!
Is too!

383
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,140
Is not!
Is too!

384
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,710
Girls!

385
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,290
Our special talent
is not arguing.

386
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,810
Besides, what would
the Cutie Mark

387
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,620
of somepony whose talent
is arguing even look like?

388
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,780
Girls? Girls?

389
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,010
Fluttershy?!

390
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,160
Girls, thank goodness
I found you.

391
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,570
Fluttershy, what --

392
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,110
Girls, we have to leave
the forest at once!

393
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,980
But we haven't found
the chicken yet.

394
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,190
There's no time
for that.

395
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,060
There's a cockatrice
on the loose.

396
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,880
A cocka-what-now?

397
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,090
A cockatrice.
It's a frightening creature

398
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,560
with the head of a chicken
and the body of a snake.

399
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,860
Now, come on!

400
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,450
The head of a chicken
and the body of a snake?

401
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,970
That doesn't sound scary.
That sounds silly.

402
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,550
Well, if I ever saw one of them
cocka-thingies face-to-face,

403
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,460
I'd laugh
at how silly it was.

404
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,880
No! Never look one
in the eye.

405
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,900
If you look a cockatrice
in the eye --

406
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,770
The chicken!

407
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,170
Girls, wait!

408
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,960
Here, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick!

409
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,150
There he is!

410
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,850
Two chickens?

411
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,260
I-i thought
only one escaped.

412
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,570
Grab them both!

413
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,840
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!

414
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,810
See? Now we have to --

415
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,000
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!

416
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,260
Girls, please.

417
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,500
Girls. Listen to me, girls.
I -- please.

418
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,190
Girls...

419
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,120
Behind me now!

420
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,740
You!

421
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,830
Just who do you think
you are,

422
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,140
going around,
turning others into stone?

423
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,390
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

424
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,510
I have half a mind
to find your mother

425
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,690
and tell you what you've
been up to, young man.

426
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,820
Now, you go over there
and turn Elizabeak

427
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,790
and my friend Twilight
back to normal,

428
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,730
and don't ever let me catch you
doing this again!

429
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
Do you understand me?

430
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,120
Are you girls all right?
I was so worried.

431
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,570
Yeah, fine.

432
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,710
Thanks to that
stare of yours.

433
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,730
You're like the queen of stares.
You're the...

434
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,650
Stare master!
Stare master!
Stare master!

435
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,910
We're sorry we snuck out of
the house and into the forest.

436
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,500
Yeah, we'll listen to you
from now on.

437
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,870
We promise.

438
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,570
Oh, you do, do you?

439
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,940
Well, you'd better,
or I'll give you...the stare.

440
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,690
What...

441
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,500
What happened?

442
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,530
And that's when it brought you
back from stone.

443
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,760
This is gonna make
quite a letter to the princess.

444
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,460
I was wrong about you.

445
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,900
You certainly do know
how to handle those girls.

446
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,820
Oh, I wouldn't go
that far.

447
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,570
Hmm? How so?

448
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,750
I assumed that I'd be
just as good with kids

449
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,980
as I am with animals.

450
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,850
Boy, was I wrong.

451
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,450
I really learned
the hard way

452
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,540
not to bite off
more than I could chew.

453
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,840
You and Rarity both.

454
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,790
Good morning, Rarity.

455
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Did you finish
all those capes?

456
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,970
Just delivered them.

457
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,580
I have to admit --
if you hadn't come along,

458
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,990
I might not have.

459
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,300
Thanks again.

460
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,600
Won't you stay
for some tea?

461
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,110
I really must get back
to the shop and clean up.

462
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,620
Girls, get your things.
Time to go.

463
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,420
Girls?

464
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,810
Girls, time to --

465
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,630
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah! That was so fun!
Girls, time to --

466
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,070
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah! That was so fun!

467
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,740
Girls, your things!

468
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,750
Oh, yeah!
My turn! My turn!

469
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,710
Girls, it's time to --
Oh, yeah!
My turn! My turn!

470
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,060
Girls, it's time to --

471
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,460
Come on!

472
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:46,490
Girls!
Seriously.
come on!

473
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,670
Girls!
Seriously.

474
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,450
Allow me.

475
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,100
Girls.

476
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,790
Yes, Fluttershy?
You called?

477
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,390
Go and get
your things.

478
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,230
Rarity's here
to see you home.

479
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,430
Of course, Fluttershy.
Right away.

480
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,380
H-how did you --
how did you do that?

481
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,330
I guess I'm just as good
with kids as I am with animals.

482
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,980
Thanks, Fluttershy!
Bye!

483
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,870
Thank you,
stare master!
Bye-bye!

484
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,780
Uh, uh,
speaking of which,

485
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,610
I could use your help
with Opal.

486
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,840
Of course.
How about later today?

487
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,830
How about now?
