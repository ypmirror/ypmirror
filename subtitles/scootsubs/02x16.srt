1
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:06,965
Hey Rarity, hey Pinkie Pie.
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,455
Rainbow Dash!

3
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:11,085
Isn't she the most daring devil?

4
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:13,415
I mean, the most devilish darer?
I mean...

5
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:15,305
She's dazzling!

6
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:19,055
Oh yeah, that's a good word.
She's dazzling!

7
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,765
- Oh no, oh no, oh no!
- Ayayayayay!

8
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:38,365
So much for dazzling...

9
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:46,225


10
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:51,255


11
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:14,325


12
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,745
<i>Is she gonna be okay?</i>

13
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,015
<i>I'm so worried!</i>

14
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:25,965
Is her face gonna stay that way?

15
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,105
- How is she, doctor?
- She's going to be fine.

16
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:39,005
Luckily, she has friends like you
who got her over here in a jiffy.

17
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:43,505
How long do I need to lie here?
I've got things I need to do!

18
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:45,665
Well, that all depends on your recovery.

19
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:47,285
But I'd say a few days minimum.

20
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:49,065
You guys have gotta get me out of here!

21
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:51,025
I'm gonna climb the walls!

22
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:52,645
Just like a spider!

23
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,715
Did the crash somehow give her
super-duper spider powers?

24
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,715
No.

25
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:59,275
Nor did it give her amazing
healing powers.

26
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:01,435
She needs to stay in bed for a few days.

27
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:05,565
Few days? Might as well be
a few months, or few years!

28
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:07,725
It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash.

29
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:10,275
I bet the chow in here
is hoof-lickin' good!

30
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:13,665
And the hospital gowns,
they match the curtains!

31
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:16,895
And look!
You have a roommate!

32
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,915
What's this?

33
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:42,425
"Daring Do and the Quest
for the Sapphire Stone."

34
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:44,545
This is the first story in the series.

35
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:45,955
I own all of them.

36
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:50,805
No thanks.
I so don't read.

37
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,675
I'm a world-class athlete.

38
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:55,235
Reading's for eggheads like you,
Twilight.

39
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:58,755
No offense, but I am not reading.

40
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:02,945
It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.

41
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:07,525
Is she serious?

42
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:10,365
Who doesn't like to read
a bang-up tale from time to time?

43
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:15,685
A good book is almost as magnificent as
silk pajamas on a Sunday morning.

44
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,825
Reading is for everypony,
Rainbow Dash!

45
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:21,175
Yeah! I love reading.

46
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:23,125
And my head isn't even close
to the shape of an egg!

47
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,025
It's more the shape of an apple,
or maybe an orange!

48
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,325
But a big orange,
more like a grapefruit really...

49
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:30,065
All right, my little ponies.

50
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:31,705
Rainbow Dash needs her rest.

51
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:33,745
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

52
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:38,755
I think you'd like Daring.
She's a lot like you.

53
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:45,255
Adventurous, fierce and undeniably,
unquestionably, unstoppable.

54
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:18,035
...to get to the other side!
Get it?

55
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:22,165
Nevermind...

56
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:56,785
As Daring-Do trekked through
the tropical jungle, the wet heat

57
00:04:56,785 --> 00:05:00,625
sapped her energy and
slowed her every step.

58
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,515
If only she could escape
this oppressive atmosphere

59
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:06,405
and fly up into the cool blue sky...

60
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,825
But her crash landing in the jungle
had injured her wing

61
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:11,765
and she was grounded for a few days.

62
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:16,635
Few days... it might as well be
a few months, or a few years!

63
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:19,025
I'm right there with you, sister.

64
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:21,905
The mosquitoes buzzed loudly.

65
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,705
<i>The macaws cried from the high trees.</i>

66
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:28,755
<i>Yet, all of these distracting noises
were not enough to cover the sound</i>

67
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:31,905
<i>of the predators following her every step.</i>

68
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:15,985
<i>Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally
allowed herself a moment to breathe.</i>

69
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:22,865
<i>She turned around to find herself
face to face with the long lost temple</i>

70
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:27,435
<i>that she had sought tirelessly
for over sixty days and nights!</i>

71
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,435
I hate to admit it to myself, and would
really hate to admit it to my friends

72
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:35,545
but... I love this story!

73
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,375
I love reading!

74
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:44,735
I'm an egghead.

75
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:59,925
<i>The smell of decay and danger
hit Daring-Do as she peered into</i>

76
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:02,895
<i>the dimly-lit entrance
of the ancient temple.</i>

77
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,735
Hi Rainbow Dash!

78
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,375
Uh, hey, guys...

79
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,365
We thought we'd come and cheer you up!

80
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,115
We brought your favorite board game!

81
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,405
We know how much you like to win!

82
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:36,775
You go first, Rainbow Dash!

83
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:39,865
No no, you first.

84
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,475
Alright... cloud three.

85
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:48,925
Aw,shucks, you... rained on my cumulus.

86
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,225
Go again!

87
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:52,355
Sky five?

88
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,785
You found my seagull!

89
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:58,425
- Cloud two?
- You zapped my weather pony!

90
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:02,165
You stung my bumblebee.
Oh, my thunderbolt.

91
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,125
And that's my last cloud.
You found it.

92
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,735
Guess you guys win, I lose.

93
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:11,835
But Rainbow Dash,
you didn't even get a turn.

94
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,715
You win some, you lose some.

95
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,095
But you don't lose some.

96
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:19,185
I don't think you've
ever lost a game of...

97
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,325
Thanks for coming!

98
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:23,025
But yesterday you were
desperate for things to do!

99
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:25,315
Do? Who said anything about Daring-Do?

100
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,745
I told you I'm not interested in reading.

101
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,065
It's nap time for me!

102
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:36,115
Glad we could... cheer you up?

103
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:45,225
Alright then.

104
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:54,795
Daring-Do stood at the entrance
to the central temple chamber.

105
00:09:54,795 --> 00:10:00,035
<i>At last, she was face-to-face with
the legendary sapphire statue!</i>

106
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:19,135
There must be a pattern here.

107
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,205
What do all these animals have in common?

108
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,935
These animals are all predators!

109
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:31,295
Except... rats!

110
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:14,125
Hello, Rainbow Dash!

111
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,355
How's our patient doing today?

112
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:25,665
We need to get some fresh air in here.

113
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:28,565
You're lookin' sweatier than a pig
wrangler on a summer's day.

114
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:32,155
Well, guys, thanks for visiting, but...

115
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:34,925
Okay, now, dinner time for Rainbow Dash.

116
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:40,645
Just in time.
I am so hungry.

117
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:42,565
Don't mind us, Rainbow Dash.

118
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,595
Yeah, just go ahead and eat up.

119
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,075
On second thought...

120
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,225
We'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash.

121
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:11,275
"You thought you could evade me
and capture the relic for yourself."

122
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:14,185
"But you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do."

123
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:18,705
And now, you shall meet your doom!

124
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,875
Who is this dude?

125
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:39,425
You won't get away with this, Ahuizotl!

126
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:41,875
But I already have...

127
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,525
Not again...

128
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,055
Quicksand!

129
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:10,845
<i>Rainbow Dash?</i>

130
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:12,655
<i>Rainbow Dash?</i>

131
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,435
Rainbow Daaaash?

132
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:21,895
- Oh, good evenin...
- Morning.

133
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,875
...morning, Doc.

134
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:27,315
Have you been up all night?

135
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:28,815
Of course not.

136
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,515
Well, I'll be quick.

137
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:35,725
Congratulations, Rainbow Dash,
we're checking you out of the hospital.

138
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,795
What?
Later today?

139
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:40,365
No.
Right now!

140
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:42,695
Right now?!
Right now, right now?

141
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,195
Right now, right now.

142
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:47,415
But I don't feel better!

143
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,415
Now take it easy, Rainbow Dash.

144
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:51,915
Remember to stay off
that wing for a week.

145
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:03,835
How will I ever find out
what happened to Daring-Do?!

146
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,815
Is Ahuizotl gonna get away
with the statuette?

147
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:12,105
What's gonna happen to Daring?!

148
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:16,095
Twilight has a copy of the book!

149
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:20,125
But I can't ask her after
I called her an egghead and all...

150
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:24,535
This is making me sick all over again!

151
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:34,635
The pain... the pain!

152
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,595
Rainbow Dash, what are you doing here?

153
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:37,595
Anything wrong?

154
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:41,335
My wing!
It's still hurting, Doc.

155
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,705
Ouch!
Right there.

156
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:49,125
I was touching your good wing.

157
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,105
Uh, right.

158
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:54,045
Well, I think that one's hurting now too.

159
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,505
I think I know what the trouble is.

160
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,695
A severe case of lazy-itis.

161
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,635
But, you got me all wrong, Doc!

162
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:05,175
I'm not being lazy!

163
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:06,835
You're fine, Rainbow Dash.

164
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:09,545
Give it some time and you'll be
right back in the swing of things.

165
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,415
Good day, Rainbow Dash.

166
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:12,415
Take care!

167
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:14,955
What am I gonna do?

168
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:18,525
I'll never get to sleep without knowing
what happens to Daring-Do!

169
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:23,225
Which may not be such a bad thing...

170
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:13,905
Feels like the harder I struggle,
the tighter the ropes get!

171
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,335
<i>Burglar, burglar!</i>

172
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,015
Someone's trying to steal my slippers!

173
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:24,155
I'm not trying to steal your slippers,
I'm trying to steal this book!

174
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,695
Stop, thief!

175
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:57,875
Hey, nopony invited me!

176
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,625
Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?

177
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:26,525
Rainbow Dash,
what in the world is going on?

178
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,115
Why are you stealing slippers?

179
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:31,935
Hey, get back to the hospital!

180
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:35,825
What's all the ruckus?

181
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,555
I'd say it's more of a fracas
than a ruckus.

182
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:41,015
What's going on, Rainbow Dash?

183
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,615
I'm an egghead.

184
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:46,915
Pardon?

185
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:50,995
See, I was trying to get back into
the hospital to finish the last chapter of...

186
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:54,185
"Daring-Do and the Quest
for the Sapphire Statue"!

187
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:55,585
You got me.

188
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,285
I knew the book was good,
but I didn't know it could drive

189
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,785
a pony to petty theft!

190
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:03,845
Good? Try awesomely amazing.

191
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:09,105
That book is undeniably,
unquestionably, un-put-down-able!

192
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:13,425
But then I had to put it down.
I was sent home before I could finish it.

193
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,755
Well, I'm glad that's all this is about.

194
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:18,335
There's no reason to go
around causin' a ruckus...

195
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,435
Fracas!

196
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:22,945
...causin' a fracas,
just because you like to read.

197
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:27,835
Like I said, I have
every book in the series.

198
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,465
And you can borrow them all,
any time you like!

199
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,125
Thanks, Twilight.

200
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,805
I'm sorry I made such a big deal
about all of this.

201
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:38,645
I thought reading was just
for smart ponies like you.

202
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:42,585
Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic
doesn't mean you aren't smart!

203
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:45,155
Yeah!
Just look at me!

204
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:54,395
Reading is something everypony can enjoy,
if they just give it a try.

205
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,095
Yeah, I get it.

206
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,805
I shouldn't knock something
until I've tried it.

207
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:00,305
That's a great lesson.

208
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:02,865
And it would make a great letter
to the Princess.

209
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,075
- Did you get all that?
- Yeah...?

210
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:07,075
Great!

211
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:09,545
You write the letter,
I've gotta finish this book!

212
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:41,265
Another day, another dungeon!

213
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:49,795
With Daring-Do out of the way,
the world will suffer mightily at my hands.

214
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:53,365
I am victorious!

215
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:59,495
I'll take that!

216
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:03,785
Wha...?
Noooooooo!

217
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:06,655
Better luck next time, Ahuizotl!

218
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,445
Curse you, Daring-Do!

219
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:18,435
And so, with Ahuizotl defeated,
and the sapphire statue secured...

220
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,675
...the world was safe and sound,
once again.

221
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:24,285
Thanks to Daring-Do!

222
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,545
Daring-Do and the Griffon's Goblet...

223
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,605
Awesome!
