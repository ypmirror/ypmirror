1
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,660
Eyes over here, Spike.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,790
Uh, sorry.

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,080
For this to work,
it's crucial

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,000
we keep our concentration
totally on the --

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,800
Ugh!

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,920
Spike...

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,800
This magic needs our full
attention to make it happen.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,930
There's no other way.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,970
I can't help it!

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,260
Look!

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,900
Never mind her.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,780
She's just being
Pinkie Pie.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,030
Super extra Pinkie Pie
today.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,910
Twitchy-twitch,
a-twitch-a-twitch!

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,660
Pinkie Pie, what in the wide,
wide world of Equestria

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,870
are you up to?

17
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,750
Oh, it's my tail!
It's my tail!

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a-twitch-a-twitchin'!

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,750
And you know
what that means.

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,800
Actually, Pinkie,
I haven't the slightest idea.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,130
The twitching means
my Pinkie sense is telling me

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,970
that stuff's
gonna start falling!

23
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,680
You two
better duck for cover!

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,300
Oh, Pinkie,
it's not gonna rain.

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,890
Why, there's barely even
a cloud in the -- Ugh!

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,600
He just said, "nice catch"
in frog.

27
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,860

00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,200

What friendship could be *

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,870
* My Little Pony

32
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,660
* Until you all shared
This magic with me *

33

* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,880

Faithful and strong *

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,380

My very best friends? *

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,100
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

40
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,150
Are you okay,
Twilight Sparkle?

41
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,860
I just couldn't stand to see the
pond getting so overpopulated,

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,150
what with the frogs all hopping
into each other and all,

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,740
so I decided to fly
as many as I can

44
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,450
on over to Froggy Bottom Bog.

45
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,910
Of course you did.

46
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,910
Bye-bye!

47
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,420
Um, Twilight,

48
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,830
you got a little something
on your face there.

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,840
Oh, really?

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,300
Did your Pinkie sense
tell you that, too?

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,380
Nah, I could just see it.

52
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,300
* La-la-la la-la
La-la-la *

53
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,470
Ptoo!

54
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,840
Come on, Spike.

55
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,100
Let's continue
our practice session

56
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,890
where there's a little less
commotion.

57
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,220
Wow!
That was amazing!

58
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,560
Pinkie Pie predicted
something would fall,

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,940
and it did!

60
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,230
Oh, come on.

61
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,060
She said
something would fall,

62
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,280
and a frog just happened to fall
right around the same time --

63
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,360
a coincidence --
nothing else to it.

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,950
My tail! My tail!

65
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,820
Twitch-a-twitch!
Twitch-a-twitch!

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,830
Something else
is gonna fall!

67
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,490
Oh, Pinkie, please.

68
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,370
Nothing else
is gonna fa-a-a-ll!

69
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,830
Unh!

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,250
Oh, no!
Twilight fell!

71
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,830
Is it safe
to go help her?

72
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,840
It's okay.
My tail stopped twitching.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,550
* La-la-la la-la,
La-la-la la-la-la *

74
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,840
That was amazing!

75
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,090
Oh, please.

76
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,930
Uh, Twilight,

77
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,140
Why are you hanging out
in a ditch?

78
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,020
Because Pinkie Pie
predicted it.

79
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,270
Honestly, Spike,
she did not.

80
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,100
Two coincidences in a row
like this may be unlikely,

81
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,060
but it's still
easier to believe

82
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,400
than twitchy tails
that predict the future.

83
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,530
Twitchy tail?

84
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,860
Pinkie sense?

85
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,990
Ohh!

86
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,070
Ugh!

87
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,320
Don't worry.
It's safe.

88
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,120
The prediction
already came true.

89
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,330
Oh, wait.

90
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,620
Don't tell me you believe
in this stuff, too.

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,370
I know it doesn't make
much sense,

92
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,580
but those of us who have been
in Ponyville awhile

93
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,590
have learned over time
that if Pinkie's a-twitchin',

94
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,590
you better listen.

95
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,050
My ears are flopping!
My ears are flopping!

96
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,550
Aah!
What does that mean?!

97
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,590
I'll start a bath
for you.

98
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,430
Huh?

99
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,640
A bath?

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,140
This thing keeps on getting
more ridiculous by the minute.

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,390
Ugh!

102
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,070
So, basically,
it works like this --

103
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,030
I get different little,
miggly feelings,

104
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,900
and they mean
different things.

105
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,910
Like, when my back gets itchy,
it means it's my lucky day.

106
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,620
And when my knee
gets pinchy,

107
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,450
that means something scary's
about to happen.

108
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,160
Is your knee
pinchy now?

109
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,950
No, but my shoulder's
achy.

110
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,370
That means there's an alligator
in the tub.

111
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420
Oh!

112
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,540
Aah!

113
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,170
How come your knee
didn't get pinchy?!

114
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,010
That isn't just scary --
it's downright dangerous!

115
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,430
No, it's not, silly.

116
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,970
This is my pet alligator
gummy.

117
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,510
He's got no teeth, see?

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,640
Okay, okay.
I get it.

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,270
Well, I still
don't believe

120
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,360
all this
special-powers stuff.

121
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,480
It's just a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.

122
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,900
What's not to believe?
You do magic.

123
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,190
What's the difference?

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,900
Huge.

125
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,530
For one thing...

126
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,200
...Magic is something
you study and practice.

127
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,330
It only happens
when you decide to do it,

128
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,460
and it's meant
to make something specific

129
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,330
that you choose to happen
happen.

130
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,130
With you, it -- it makes
no sense at all!

131
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,170
That's so not true,
Twilight.

132
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,380
Sometimes it's a bunch
of random things

133
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,430
happening to my body
at random times

134
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,560
that supposedly predict
the future.

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,970
I call 'em "combos."

136
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,220
Combos?

137
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,480
Sure.

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,270
You know, like ear flop,
then knee twitch,
then eye flutter --

139
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,560
that means the sky
is about to be graced

140
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,110
with a beautiful rainbow.

141
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,320
Yeah, sure.

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,320
Uh-oh.

143
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,940
I feel a combo
coming on.

144
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,990
Ear flop, eye flutter,
knee twitch.

145
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,460
You said that combo
meant beautiful rainbow.

146
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,130
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no.

147
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,040
You're thinking of
an ear flop,

148
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,550
then knee twitch,
then eye flutter.

149
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,590
This was an ear flop,
then eye flutter,
then knee twitch.

150
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,130
That usually means
"look out for opening doors."

151
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,220
Are you okay?

152
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,600
I don't believe this.

153
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,680
You don't believe
because you don't understand.

154
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,730
Hmm.

155
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,320
Okay. Now, when you get
another twitch,

156
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,740
we'll have all kinds
of scientific information.

157
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,240
Okey-dokey-lokey!

158
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,160
Any twitches yet?

159
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,210
Nopey-dopey.

160
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,300
Now? Anything?

161
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,050
Wait! Hold on!

162
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,470
Uh, no.

163
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,390
Are you kidding me?

164
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,850
After a whole day
of nonstop twitching,

165
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,850
now that I've got you
all hooked up,

166
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,520
you're not getting
a single one?!

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,100
I don't control it.
They just come and go.

168
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,350
That makes no sense!

169
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,360
Sometimes you just have to
believe in things,

170
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,110
even when you can't
figure them out.

171
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,490
I will not believe in anything
I cannot explain.

172
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,450
Wait. Hold on.

173
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm feeling something.

174
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
Oh, my gosh!

175
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
What?
What is it?!

176
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,950
It's my tummy!

177
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,120
That usually means I'm hungry.
Let's eat!

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Ugh!!

179
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,130
You know what?

180
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,590
Just forget it.

181
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,840
I don't need to know
if this is real or not.

182
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,630
I don't need to understand it.
I don't even care!

183
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,890
Okey-dokey-lokey!

184
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,350
Uh-oh.

185
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Pinkie,
have you seen Twilight?

186
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,320
Uh-huh.

187
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,160
Twilight, what are you doing
back there?

188
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,160
Did you two plan this?

189
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,290
Plan what?

190
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,290
Ugh!
This is ridiculous!

191
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,580
This can't be happening!
This makes no sense!

192
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,630
I have to figure this out.

193
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,020
Mmm!

194
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,170
Twilight?
Aah!

195
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,960
Whoa-oh!

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,590
Honestly, Spike,
don't you know better

197
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,050
than to sneak up
on ponies?

198
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,050
Oh, sorry.
But, um, well,

199
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,260
isn't that
what you're doing?

200
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,680
No.

201
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,220
I'm doing
scientific research.

202
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,180
I'm observing Pinkie Pie --

203
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,980
scientific name,
Pinkius Pieacus --

204
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,560
in its natural habitat.

205
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,480
Pinkius who-acus?

206
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,480
Aah!

207
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,360
There's something fishy
going on

208
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,610
with the whole
twitchy-prediction thing,

209
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,240
and I'm getting to the bottom
of it, so shh!

210
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,620
Come on.

211
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,620
Pinkius Pieacus
is on the move.

212
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,010
Hmm.
Itchy nose.

213
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,050
Aha!
That makes no sense.

214
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,970
See? She's hiding
like something's about
to fall from the sky,

215
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,890
but a twitchy tail

216
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,680
means something's gonna fall
from the sky,

217
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,190
not an itchy nose.

218
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,190
This proves,
perhaps conclusively,

219
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,360
That --
Aah!

220
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,570
Spike,
where are you going?

221
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,200
I'm trying to teach you
the value of scientific obser--

222
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,200
Ow!
Ouch! Ow! Ohh!

223
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,660
What's she doing now?

224
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,580
Smelling a flower.

225
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
Holy guacamole!

226
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,250
I wonder what that means!

227
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,590
Probably that the flower
smells good.

228
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,050
Wait.
I'm getting something.

229
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,260
Ear flop...

230
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,430
eye flutter...

231
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,550
knee twitch.

232
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,430
Hold on.

233
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,600
She told me that's the combo
that says,

234
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,350
"watch out
for opening doors."

235
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,230
You really, really believe
this stuff, don't you?

236
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,230
Here.

237
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,440
Let me show you
there's nothing to be afraid of.

238
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,980
You see?

239
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,400
I promise you, there's nothing
to fear from that --

240
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,110
Whoa!
Ow! Ow! Ohh! Ow!

241
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,570
Twilight! You came
to visit my new apple cellar.

242
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,240
How nice.

243
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,330
Twi? You okay?
Uh, Twi?

244
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,630
Here. Let me help you.

245
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,300
Okay.

246
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,590
Take this down.

247
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,470
Twitchy tail.

248
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,630
Twitchy tail?

249
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,180
Twitchy tail!

250
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,220
Ohh! Hush, Spike.

251
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,600
We can't let Pinkie know
we're here, remember?

252
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Something's gonna fall!
Something's gonna fall!

253
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Run for your lives!
Whoa-oh-oh!

254
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,600
Ohh, Spike, honestly.
You're overreacti--

255
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,190
Ugh!

256
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,110
Ohh!

257
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,780
Hey, Applejack.
What you doing?

258
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,120
Taking more apples
to my new apple cellar.

259
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,120
How about you, Pinkie?
What you doing?

260
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,330
Oh, letting Twilight
secretly follow me all day

261
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,330
without me knowing.

262
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,670
You mean
you knew all along?

263
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,500
Why didn't you tell me?

264
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,340
Silly.

265
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,470
That would have spoiled
the secret.

266
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,680
Uh...uh...

267
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,800
Ugh!

268
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,720
Tail...
still twitching?

269
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,800
All done.

270
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,430
Clear skies from here on in,
as far as I can tell.

271
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Oh, no!
What does that one mean?

272
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,110
Don't know -- never gotten
any like it before.

273
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,190
But whatever that shudder's
about, it's a doozy!

274
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,860
Something you never expect
to happen is gonna happen!

275
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,370
And it's gonna happen...

276
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,700
at Froggy Bottom Bog!

277
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,790
That's where
Fluttershy's headed.

278
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh, no!
Is it about her?

279
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,250
Uh, I'm not sure.

280
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,590
We'd better go
and make sure she's okay.

281
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,590
Calm down, everypony.

282
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,380
All we know right now
is that Pinkie Pie

283
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,510
just got a case
of the shivers -- that's all.

284
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,180
Huh?!

285
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,140
Hey, I thought you didn't
believe in this stuff.

286
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,270
I don't.

287
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,600
I just want to be there
to see the look on Pinkie's face

288
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,690
when we find out
nothing's wrong.

289
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,860
Okey-dokey!

290
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,380
Cold?

291
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,170
Need a jacket
or something?

292
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,880
No, thanks.
I'm fine.

293
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,430
So, what do you think happened
to Fluttershy?

294
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,430
I hope nothing.

295
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,270
I know, but what do you think
happened?

296
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,600
I'm trying
not to think about it.

297
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,190
Me too...

298
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,900
But I'm thinking about it,
anyway,

299
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,690
like...
what if she exploded?!

300
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,280
Just exploded
for no reason?

301
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,620
Yeah, like, boom!

302
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,620
Whoa!

303
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,620
I know.

304
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,740
What if --
what if she exploded

305
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,290
and then --
and then exploded again?!

306
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,330
Can you do that?!
Can you explode twice?!

307
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,880
Of course not.

308
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,750
But what if she exploded

309
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,510
and exploded again
and then --

310
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,170
Will you two stop?

311
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,510
She's fine.
I'm sure of it.

312
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,930
I hope you're right,
for Fluttershy's sake.

313
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,350
Look!
There's Froggy Bottom Bog!

314
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,440
Fluttershy!

315
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,610
Fluttershy!

316
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,910
Fluttershy,
you're okay!

317
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,660
Of course.

318
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,750
Whew! What a relief.

319
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,210
I'm so glad
everything's all right!

320
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,380
Sorry.
I know it's not nice to gloat,

321
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,920
but -- Ha ha! --
Whoa!

322
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,510
I told you there was
nothing to worry about,

323
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,510
and I was right.

324
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,840
Pinkie Pie said whatever
she was shuddering about

325
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,970
was a doozy,
and --

326
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,220
and the only doozy here
is how right I am.

327
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,680
Um
Twilight...

328
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,940
Pinkie's made a lot
of predictions today, but...

329
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,400
Ugh,
what is that smell?!

330
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,940
...but what we've shown here
is that there is no point

331
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,280
in believing
in anything

332
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,950
you can't see
for yourself.

333
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,530
W-well, then s-s-see what's
b-b-behind you, Twilight!

334
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,580
I see it...

335
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,580
but I don't believe it!

336
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,090
Is that a hydra?!

337
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,760
Who cares? Run!

338
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,720
Oh!

339
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,390
Pinkie, come on!

340
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,440
Oh, I'm so sorry.

341
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,030
Oh!

342
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,040
Everypony
up that hill.

343
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,550
Help!

344
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,380
Coming, Spike!

345
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,470
Hang on!

346
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,850
I think
we're gonna make it!

347
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,980
But Pinkie's
still shuddering!

348
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,320
Oh, looky there.
It stopped.

349
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,740
Oh!

350
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,950
There...it...is...again!

351
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,090
He'll be up here in no time.

352
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,130
Quick!
One at a time, cross!

353
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,920
Aaah!

354
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,800
Uh, do you know
any spells

355
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
for turning a hydra
into a mouse?
No.

356
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,470
How about a squirrel?
No.

357
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,970
How about --
No small rodents
of any kind!

358
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,350
That's too bad.

359
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,520
A hop, skip, and a jump!

360
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,980
Whoa-oh!

361
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,610
Wh-o-o-oa!

362
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,780
He's too close.

363
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,110
I'll distract him.

364
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,660
You two go -- now!

365
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,080
Oh, what would a brave pony
like Rainbow Dash do?

366
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,370
Cha-a-a-a-rge!

367
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,680
T-T-T-Twilight?!

368
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,000
T-T-T-Twilight!

369
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,580
You have to jump!

370
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,130
I'll never make it!

371
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,420
You'll be fine!

372
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,960
I will not!

373
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,930
It's your only h-hope!

374
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,180
You have to take
a leap of faith!

375
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,900
No!

376
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,870
Oh, no!

377
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,080
Noooo!

378
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
Unh!

379
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,120
Wh-o-o-oa!

380
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,210
Ugh.

381
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,590
I knew you could do it,
Twilight!

382
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,930
I don't know
how it happened --

383
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,180
coincidence, dumb luck,
or what --

384
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,140
but you said there'd be a doozy
here at Froggy Bottom Bog,

385
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,060
and I'd say
we just had ourselves

386
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,140
one heck of a doozy.

387
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,730
I mean, that hydra --

388
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,730
Pinkie?

389
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,570
That wasn't it.
Huh?

390
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,980
What wasn't what?

391
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,490
What are you
talking about, Pink?

392
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,200
The hydra
wasn't the doozy.

393
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,870
Pbht!

394
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,790
I'm still getting
the shudders.

395
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,910
You see?
There it is again.

396
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,000
Whatever the doozy was
at Froggy Bottom Bog,

397
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,920
my Pinkie sense says
it still hasn't happened.

398
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,210
Huh?
But I -- What?!

399
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,090
The hydra
wasn't the doozy?

400
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,090
How could it not be
the doozy?!

401
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,180
What could be doozier
than that?!

402
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Don't know,
but it just wasn't it.

403
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,810
Ugh!

404
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,110
Ohhh.

405
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,650
I give up.

406
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,150
Give what up, Twi?

407
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,030
The fight.
I can't fight it anymore.

408
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,030
I don't understand
how, why, or what,

409
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,160
but Pinkie sense
somehow...makes sense.

410
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,950
I don't see how it does,
but it just does.

411
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,000
Just because I don't understand
doesn't mean it's not true.

412
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,580
Y-y-you mean
you b-b-b-believe?

413
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,920
Yep.

414
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,170
I guess I do.

415
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,800
That was it!

416
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,810
That's the doozy!

417
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,060
What?

418
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,310
What is?

419
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,640
You believing!

420
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,100
I never expected that
to happen!

421
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,980
That was the doozy!

422
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,110
Oh, and, oh, what a doozy
of a doozy it was!

423
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,940
* La-la-la
La-la la-la *

424
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,030
* La-la-la
La-la la-la *

425
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,120
Oh, good, Spike.
You're here.

426
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,330
Take a letter.

427
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,870
With pleasure, Twilight.

428
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,830
"Dear Princess Celestia...

429
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,790
I'm happy
to report that --"

430
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,880
Spike, what have I been saying
about focus?

431
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,300
I know, but I --

432
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,590
Well...

433
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,670
What's wrong, Spike?

434
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,050
Never thought you'd see me
with an umbrella hat on?

435
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,890
Not really, no.

436
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,600
Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'.
What else can I do?

437
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,690
"I am happy to report
that I now realize

438
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,360
"there are wonderful things
in this world

439
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,530
"you just can't explain,

440
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,070
"but that doesn't necessarily
make them any less true.

441
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,240
"It just means you have to
choose to believe in them,

442
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,370
Aad sometimes it takes a friend
to show you the way."

443
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,620
Honk!

444
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,700
"Honk."

445
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,830
"Always, your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle."

446
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,130
There it goes again.

447
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,880
I wonder what's gonna drop out
of the sky this time.

448
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,930
You never know.

449
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,890
Twitchy tail?

450
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,730
Holy guacamole!

451
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,650
* My Little Pony

452
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,780
* My Little Pony

453
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,790
* My Little Pony

454
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,800
* Friends
