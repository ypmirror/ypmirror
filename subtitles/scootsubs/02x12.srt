1
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:15,065
The timber wolves are a-howlin'!

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,115
The timber wolves are a-howlin'!

3
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:21,965
Eeyup.

4
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:23,745
The Zap Apples are comin'!

5
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:25,725
The Zap Apples are comin'!

6
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:27,305
Yay!

7
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:29,215
The Zap Apples are comin'!

8
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:31,195
That's what I said.

9
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:40,615


10
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:46,305


11
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:08,355


12
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:11,995
Hey, silly goose!

13
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:14,385
Quit your gawkin' and move your caboose!

14
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,335
Ready, Granny!

15
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:25,865
Ready for what?

16
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:28,015
For makin' Zap Apple Jam!

17
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:29,295
Darn tootin'!

18
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:33,435
It's time for some good old-fashioned
Zap Apple Jammin'!

19
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:35,205
Yes mam, I can't wait mam!

20
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,735
Wait for what?

21
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:41,025
To make Zap Apple Jam with you!

22
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:42,065
Of course!

23
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:45,285
Now I been doing this
ever since I was a little pony.

24
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:49,525
So be warned, pickle pear,
there's a whole mess steps in this process

25
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:51,995
and you got to get
each one of them just right.

26
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,575
Or no Zap Apple Jam.

27
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:55,965
Take this.

28
00:01:56,115 --> 00:02:00,005
Is this one of your gazillion secret herbal
ingredients for the Zap Apple Jam?

29
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:02,515
That there's a broom.

30
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,465
Now get sweepin', pipsqueak!

31
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:07,365
Now while you sweep, I'll get to...

32
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:11,845
Oh ponyfeathers!

33
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:14,855
Bet I'd forget my mane if
it wasn't attached to my head.

34
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:36,205
There's the Zap Apple leaves.

35
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,565
Right on schedule!

36
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:56,015
Well, howdy-doo there, Filthy Rich!

37
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:57,515
Hello, Mrs. Smith.

38
00:02:57,665 --> 00:03:01,725
Did I hear right that there's a
Zap Apple harvest coming in a few days?

39
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,105
Four days, to be exact.

40
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:05,595
Excellent news!

41
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:08,695
And as usual,
I get your first hundred jars?

42
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:10,185
'Course, Filthy.

43
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:11,885
I prefer Rich?

44
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:17,395
Oh, you poor, poor thing...

45
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:20,995
Having to make all that
Zap Apple Jam with Granny Smith.

46
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:27,375
Actually, I been looking forward to
making Zap Apple Jam for years!

47
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:31,135
I'm not talking about the jam,
I'm talking about Granny Smith!

48
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:34,375
You must be sooo embarassed.

49
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:38,155
What do ya mean?

50
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:42,735
You know, with all her silly ways,
how she forgets things,

51
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:45,665
and makes you wear
these ridiculous costumes?

52
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:47,555
Granny said that the water needs-

53
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,695
Thank goodness
you're here on the farm

54
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:52,775
and not in town where
everypony could see you.

55
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,335
Don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

56
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,345
"Silly ways"?

57
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,735
Thank you kindly, Filthy!

58
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:07,105
Shake a leg there, slowpoke!

59
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:10,395
We got a gaggle's worth of goods
to gather before the harvest.

60
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:11,755
Come on!

61
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,585
Gonna make Zap Apple Jam, oopsie ooh!

62
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:16,695
Gatherin' the goodies now, oopdie hee!

63
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:26,315
They don't make 'em like they used to.

64
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,865
Hey, you bite it, you buy it!

65
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:48,415
Why hello bees, Beatrice, Beecher!

66
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:51,835
You've all been busy little bees,
haven't you?

67
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:59,185
Granny, isn't there a less silly way
to get the honey?

68
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:06,565
Isn't this just precious?

69
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:08,005
Please stop!

70
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:11,835
And it is perfect for makin'
our Zap Apple Jam!

71
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,295
Stop it, Granny!

72
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:16,675
Granny, please!

73
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,045
Those ponies over there are watchin' me!

74
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:22,495
What? Are those fillies your friends?

75
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:25,335
Hello, Half-pint's friends!

76
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,585
Hi, Granny Smith!

77
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:30,215
Hi, Half-pint!

78
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,155
What dolls.

79
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:38,125
Why, when I was little,
ponies didn't come that purdy.

80
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:39,855
Are we done shopping, Granny?

81
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,205
'Cause I'd like to get back
to the farm, fast.

82
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,935
Hold on, snellybelly.

83
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,195
And by capturing
the whole sale market,

84
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:58,055
purchasing in bulk
and slashing all prices,

85
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:01,455
we undermine every other
gift market in town.

86
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:04,315
And that's how Rich's
Barnyard Bargains

87
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:07,485
became the cornerstone
of retail in Ponyville.

88
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:12,315
Well, thank you, Mr. Filthy-

89
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,225
I mean, Mr. Rich.

90
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,255
What a wonderful day of sharing!

91
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:20,055
And thank you for being a part of
Family Appreciation Day!

92
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:24,035
Now, let's see who will be
bringing in a family member

93
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,745
for next Monday's
Family Appreciation Day...

94
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,295
Apple Bloom!

95
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:33,355
But Miss Cheerilee,
Monday is Zap Apple harvest day!

96
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:36,985
And Applejack and Big Macintosh
will be too busy to come and speak.

97
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:40,235
Well, is there anypony else
in your family that could-

98
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:42,205
Miss Cheerilee!

99
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:45,345
Apple Bloom's Granny Smith
isn't working harvest...

100
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,395
She could come.

101
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,895
Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn't-

102
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:52,965
That's a splendid idea,
Diamond Tiara!

103
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:56,475
Apple Bloom, you shall bring in
Granny Smith on Monday.

104
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:00,105
Have a great weekend,
everypony!

105
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,095
Granny Smith?

106
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:04,655
Come Monday?

107
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:07,675
I'll be the laughing stock of Ponyville!

108
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,575
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom.

109
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:20,225
I already told you that we just
can't take a break from harvest

110
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,375
to come to your school.

111
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,325
You know what'll happen.

112
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:24,525
I know...

113
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:27,945
After the fifth day,
the Zap Apples disappear...

114
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:41,845
Look! The third sign!

115
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,245
Right on time!

116
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,495
Hot diggity!

117
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:01,945
Alright, you lazy daisies,
move your caboose!

118
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:06,295
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom,
but don't you fret.

119
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:10,025
Granny Smith's got no shortage
of entertainin' stories to tell.

120
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:13,015
I know. That's what
I'm worried about...

121
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:17,945
I'll be embarrassed,

122
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,165
shamed,

123
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:20,355
disgraced,

124
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:21,505
mortified,

125
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:22,815
humiliate-

126
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,045
What are you, a dictionary?

127
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,605
Snap out of it,
we're here to help you!

128
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:30,665
After all, we are
the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

129
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,375
We'll figure out a way
to postpone your presentation.

130
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,675
But how?

131
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:39,765
All this worry is makin' me sick!

132
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:41,805
Sick?

133
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,685
That's it!

134
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:46,235
C'mon!

135
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:50,245
Ten-hut!

136
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,075
Now listen here, troops!

137
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:57,775
I don't want any whinin', or cryin',
or crackin' under pressure!

138
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,905
Do I make myself clear?

139
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:03,765
Court-martial!

140
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:11,875
Stay still, Apple Bloom!
You have to look sick!

141
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:18,465
Hey, this is hot!

142
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:21,425
What in the hayseed is going on
in there, silly billy?

143
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:25,945
Oh, Granny Smith!

144
00:09:26,095 --> 00:09:28,875
We were just about to come get you!

145
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:30,475
Apple Bloom's sick!

146
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,885
Looks like she may have
to stay home all week!

147
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:41,505
Perfect as a Piccadilly pear!

148
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:43,895
Now what?

149
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:47,995
It's already almost sundown!

150
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,745
Tomorrow is Sunday

151
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:52,445
and I only have one more day
to figure something out!

152
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:54,005
Hey! Look!

153
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,025
That's the fourth sign!

154
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,455
The Zap Apples have appeared!

155
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:17,015
And that gives me an idea!

156
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:29,495
We can't move Family Appreciation Day,
so let's move harvest day instead!

157
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,335
They don't look... quite ripe.

158
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:34,675
Harvesting apples early
never hurt an apple.

159
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:35,765
I don't know...

160
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:39,175
Zap Apple trees aren't like
normal apple trees.

161
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,505
They're magic.

162
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:42,635
How different can they be?

163
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:52,605
Well if we can't buck 'em,
let's just pick 'em!

164
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:13,315
Any other bright ideas?

165
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:17,255
Granny Smith,

166
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:18,885
it's Miss Cheerilee!

167
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:21,025
Apple Bloom said you wanted
to speak with me?

168
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,255
Hello?

169
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,425
Granny Smi-

170
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,555
Well hello there! Howdydoo!

171
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:34,315
Hi... Granny Smith.

172
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:36,435
Is everything okay?

173
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:39,775
Of course it is!
Why wouldn't it be?

174
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,085
Excuse me.

175
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,775
Pickles always give me the hiccups!

176
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:59,465
I need to tell you that I can't make
the presentation on Monday after all!

177
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,115
Oh no, is that so?

178
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,095
No doubts about it!

179
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:07,805
I gotta shear the flowers
and water the sheep!

180
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:08,965
I mean...

181
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:12,225
I have to water the flowers
and shear the sheep!

182
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:14,285
That's too bad.

183
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:15,725
We can reschedule.

184
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:20,015
Where am I?

185
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:24,865
Well howdy, Miss Cheerilee!

186
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,695
You window shopping?

187
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,825
No, you asked me to come here

188
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:35,125
to tell me that you wouldn't be making it
to Family Appreciation Day?

189
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:36,475
Fiddlesticks!

190
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:40,045
I wouldn't miss it
for all the tea in Canterlot!

191
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:42,205
But, didn't you just say...

192
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:43,385
See you Monday!

193
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:52,985
I can't believe she woke up
from her nap.

194
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:56,055
She never wakes up from her nap!

195
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:59,415
I wish I could just run off and hide!

196
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,805
Well, you can't run off...

197
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:06,255
But maybe somepony else can!

198
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,515
The Zap Apple harvest has begun!

199
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,435
And tomorrow we'll be making up
some Zap Apple Jam!

200
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,145
Miss Granny Smith?
Telegram.

201
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:48,275
Well, bust my buttons.

202
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:51,575
Uncle Apple Strudel wants me
to pay him a visit.

203
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:53,745
And you can just make the 8am train.

204
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,435
I already packed you a bag!

205
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,705
Well that was considerate.

206
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,685
But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet!

207
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:02,585
I'll be back in time to make that jam!

208
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:06,235
That train ride takes all day.

209
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:07,735
I'm safe.

210
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:11,675
For today's Family Appreciation Day,

211
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:14,415
we are pleased
to welcome Granny Smith.

212
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:19,465
Apple Bloom?
Is Granny Smith here?

213
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:22,335
I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee,

214
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:26,835
but she got called out of town
on account of a family emergency...

215
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:29,705
Well howdy, my little ponies!

216
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:36,675
Howdy, y'all!

217
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:40,265
I'm as happy as a pig
in a fresh mudpile to be here!

218
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:44,095
What are you doing here?

219
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:45,685
Did you miss the train?

220
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,815
No, it came.

221
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:50,865
And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it.

222
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,105
Ooooooh, noogie noogie noggie!

223
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:59,025
I can't wait to hear
Granny Smith's presentation...

224
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,025
If she can remember any of it.

225
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:08,625
Long ago, when I was a little pony,

226
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:13,195
things were very different
here in Ponyville.

227
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:17,825
'Cause there was no Ponyville!

228
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,425
<i>That's right, my little ponies.</i>

229
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:26,185
<i>Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk
back when I was a little filly.</i>

230
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,645
<i>We ventured far and wide,</i>

231
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,035
<i>collecting new seeds
and sellin' them on.</i>

232
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:35,775
<i>But my pa was the finest seed collector
in all of Equestria.</i>

233
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:40,355
<i>Then, one day, the Smith family
found themselves in the most brilliant,</i>

234
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:43,685
<i>most grand, most magnificent
of all cities.</i>

235
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:45,645
<i>A place called...</i>

236
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:47,795
<i>Canterlot.</i>

237
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,295
<i>Why, I bet your hooves to hindquarters that</i>

238
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:53,275
<i>I had never seen anything like it
before nor since.</i>

239
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,755
<i>And as if the beauty of
that city wasn't enough,</i>

240
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,355
<i>suddenly, she appeared.</i>

241
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:01,005
<i>Princess Celestia.</i>

242
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,735
<i>The most regal of all ponies.</i>

243
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:05,615
<i>When lo and behold,</i>

244
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:10,055
<i>she stopped and look at
my pa's seed collection.</i>

245
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:13,395
<i>Then Princess Celestia saw that
we were plumb-tuckered</i>

246
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,815
<i>and hankerin' to find
our forever home.</i>

247
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,265
<i>And bein' a royal Princess and all,</i>

248
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:22,325
<i>she knew exactly the place for us
to lay down our stakes.</i>

249
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:25,365
<i>My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks.</i>

250
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:30,045
<i>We quickly found that land
near the Everfree Forest,</i>

251
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:32,495
<i>and we built our first home.</i>

252
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,925
<i>Next, we planted our first orchards.</i>

253
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:37,715
<i>But an orchard don't grow overnight,</i>

254
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:40,505
<i>and we were getting
mighty short on food.</i>

255
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:46,545
<i>Now mind you, we were
cautioned about the forest,</i>

256
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,845
<i>and we knew that
it was not fit to enter.</i>

257
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:52,945
<i>But I knew there was
critters livin' there,</i>

258
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,295
<i>so there must be somethin' to eat.</i>

259
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:57,255
<i>It was dark and musty,</i>

260
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,905
<i>and I won't lie, it was scary.</i>

261
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:02,945
<i>But every inch was covered in plant life.</i>

262
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:05,035
<i>And before I knew it,
wasn't I standin'</i>

263
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:07,535
<i>in front of the most incredible...</i>

264
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:09,905
<i>apple trees!</i>

265
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:15,415
<i>I had never seen anything before
this kind of colorful fruit!</i>

266
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:18,675
<i>I started picking apples,
quick as a whip!</i>

267
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:32,015
<i>I turned, and there before me stood...</i>

268
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,205
<i>the timber wolves!</i>

269
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:39,735
<i>I'd never run so fast in my life.</i>

270
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,655
<i>I did the only thing I could think of.</i>

271
00:17:57,485 --> 00:18:00,085
<i>My pa and I planted
those special apple seeds</i>

272
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:02,755
<i>and before our eyes
they grew like wildfire.</i>

273
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:09,565
<i>Well, we had full grown trees faster
than you could say lickety split.</i>

274
00:18:10,415 --> 00:18:12,875
<i>Then each year,
I paid close attention to</i>

275
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,805
<i>the signs of the Zap Apple
special harvesting times.</i>

276
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,475
<i>How the weather affects
the Everfree Forest,</i>

277
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,415
<i>how the timber wolves howl when
the Zap Apples first start growing,</i>

278
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:26,275
<i>and how they zapped away if
you didn't pick 'em all in one day!</i>

279
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:30,615
<i>And the fruits of our labor were
the best fruit we ever tasted.</i>

280
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:34,325
<i>Soon enough I was mixing up
batches of Zap Apple Jam.</i>

281
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:37,575
<i>Just like harvestin' the Zap Apples
had its special rules,</i>

282
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:40,435
<i>so did makin' Zap Apple Jam!</i>

283
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:43,675
<i>I learned that you gotta be
extra friendly with the bees,</i>

284
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:48,025
<i>otherwise their honey won't taste rightly
sweet to mix in with the Zap Apples.</i>

285
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:52,175
<i>Who'd'a thought that glass jars
needed talking to?</i>

286
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:56,765
<i>Or that Zap Apples
like pink polka dots?</i>

287
00:18:56,915 --> 00:19:00,345
<i>But magic is as magic does.
Just funny that way.</i>

288
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:04,195
<i>Then ponies started comin' to
our farm from far and wide,</i>

289
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:06,735
<i>just to get a taste
of my Zap Apple Jam.</i>

290
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:09,415
<i>Some of them decided to stay,
like Stinkin' Rich,</i>

291
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,535
<i>Diamond Tiara's great grandfather.</i>

292
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:14,815
<i>Matter of fact,
the first thing he ever sold</i>

293
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,855
<i>was my Zap Apple Jam.</i>

294
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,905
<i>And before we knew it,
we had ourselves a nice little town.</i>

295
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:23,365
<i>Bustling with all kinds of ponies.</i>

296
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:28,895
<i>And that is how Ponyville was founded.</i>

297
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:45,895
Thank you kindly, little ponies.

298
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:48,905
Now now, let's settle down.

299
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,245
So if it weren't for you
and the Zap Apples,

300
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:53,025
Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!

301
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:54,865
Darn tootin', little filly!

302
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:57,025
If it weren't for my Granny Smith,

303
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,855
your daddy wouldn't have
Barnyard Bargains.

304
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:05,085
But-

305
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:10,815
But she's just a... kooky old lady!

306
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:14,015
She is not a kooky old lady!

307
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:17,435
She is the most amazing pony
in all of Ponyville!

308
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:40,285
I think this is the best
Zap Apple Jam I've tasted yet!

309
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:43,915
Must because YOU had something
to do with it, Apple Bloom.

310
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,555
You betcha.

311
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:49,415
Apple Bloom is one humdinger
of a Zap Apple Jammer!

312
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:50,765
I am?

313
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:54,035
So I take it
Family Appreciation Day went well?

314
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:57,935
Did it? My Granny Smith
is super special!

315
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,405
I just forgot that for a little while.

316
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:04,795
Aw, don't fret.
I forget things all the time.

317
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:06,935
Now, I'll getcha...

318
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,595
somethin'.

319
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:15,805
Who wants to help Granny
sing to the water?
