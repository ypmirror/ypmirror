00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,370
Oh, I see.
A big cheater is what I see.

362
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,580
Rainbow, Applejack
would never cheat.

363
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,090
It was just an accident.

this is just a game.

Yes, but the rules
have changed.

at that game.

doing her best to catch up.

I'm not sure how
"ketchup" is gonna help
her in this contest.

Now, in a
hot-dog-eating contest,

It can make them doggies
nice and slippery.

But personally,
I prefer mustard.

How about you, Spike?

in quite a pickle,

that this has been

But it isn't the running
that's been fascinating --
