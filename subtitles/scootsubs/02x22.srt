1
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:07,495
Calling all pegasus ponies!
Meeting tonight!

2
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:18,045
Mandatory meeting
for all Ponyville pegasi.

3
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:22,245
Library, tonight.
Be cool, or be mule.

4
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:24,345
No offense.

5
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:25,925
None taken.

6
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:32,825
Alright, go on in, find a seat.

7
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,105
You too, Fluttershy.

8
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:45,845
Come on, let's go.

9
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:55,375


10
00:00:57,215 --> 00:01:00,955


11
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:23,195


12
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:35,455
<i>Every living thing depends on
the life-giving nourishment of rainwater.</i>

13
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:39,105
<i>And it is up to Cloudsdale
to provide rain-filled clouds</i>

14
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:41,465
<i>to every corner of Equestria.</i>

15
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:46,335
<i>But how, one pony might ask,
does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water?</i>

16
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,975
<i>Tornado power!</i>

17
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,525
<i>That's right, pegasi-driven tornado power.</i>

18
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:57,355
<i>A team of pegasi combine their wing power
to create a jumbo tornado,</i>

19
00:01:57,505 --> 00:02:00,665
<i>powerful enough to pull water
out of the local reservoir,</i>

20
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:03,805
<i>and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale.</i>

21
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,845
<i>Remember, pegasi,
your jumbo tornado</i>

22
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:10,085
<i>must reach a minimum of
eight hundred wing power</i>

23
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:12,555
<i>to lift that water up to Cloudsdale.</i>

24
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,765
<i>So, the next time you're wondering</i>

25
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:18,085
<i>"Where does all that extra
rainwater come from?"</i>

26
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,705
<i>just rememb-</i>

27
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:27,525
Uh... intermission?

28
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:29,075
So, here's the scoop.

29
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,965
Cloudsdale has chosen
our own highland reservoir

30
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:34,815
as a source of the rainwater
they need for all of Equestria.

31
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:36,565
And you know what that means.

32
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:40,505
It means it's up to Ponyville's pegasi
to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.

33
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,505
Not only that, but Spitfire,
captain of the Wonderbolts,

34
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:49,235
will be here to oversee the water transfer
and record our top tornado windspeed.

35
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:52,055
Now last year, Fillydelphia
broke the windspeed record

36
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,765
with a top speed of
nine hundred and ten wing power.

37
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:56,595
But I think we can do better.

38
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:59,835
I think we can get a top speed
over a thousand!

39
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:05,705
IF each and every pony trains,
and trains hard

40
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,785
to get their wing power numbers up.

41
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:12,345
That coughing better be from
a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane.

42
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:14,335
Nopony's getting sick on my watch.

43
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,885
So, are we gonna train hard?

44
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:17,935
Yeah!

45
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,955
Are we gonna be strong?

46
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:21,105
Yeah!

47
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:22,755
Are we gonna be fast?

48
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:24,305
Yeah!

49
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,585
Record-smashing fast?

50
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:27,685
Yeah!

51
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:30,525
Who's with me?

52
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:38,045
Fluttershy!

53
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:43,955
Stretch those glutes, Flitter!

54
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:46,245
Nice flexibility, Cloudchaser.

55
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:48,855
A little too much flexibility,
Blossomforth.

56
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:51,245
Somepony give Blossomforth a hoof.

57
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:53,725
Let's see some faster trotting,
Thunderlane!

58
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:56,385
Good pace, Silverspeed!

59
00:03:58,295 --> 00:03:59,205
Keep it up!

60
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:02,345
We're gonna need all the wing power
we can get to break that record!

61
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:03,795
Yeah!

62
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:06,965
Good work, everypony!

63
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:10,425
Everypony except Fluttershy.

64
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:15,275
Fluttershy? I know you're in there!

65
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,935
You're avoiding tornado duty
and I want to know why!

66
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:19,485
Fluttershy, open-

67
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,285
Hi, Rainbow Dash.

68
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:29,155
Fluttershy, what happened to you?

69
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:33,025
Oh, I...
I think I have the pony pox.

70
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:37,355
I'm sorry, I really, really wanted
to come to training day today...

71
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,555
But this pony pox has really
knocked me for a loop.

72
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:45,455
Oh, you poor thing.

73
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:48,385
You know, there's only
one cure for pony pox.

74
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:50,875
I know, plenty of bed-

75
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,515
Cold water!

76
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:56,285
Those pony pox are clearing right up.

77
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:00,515
Y'know, all of a sudden I'm,
I'm starting to feel better.

78
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,965
I'll just get out of these robes and-

79
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,455
My wing, oh ow, it's hurt.
I guess I can't fly after all.

80
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:11,505
Messed up wing, huh?

81
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:17,555
Stop horsing around, Fluttershy.
We've got a lot of training to do.

82
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,725
Come on now, what's going on?

83
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,695
Well, y'see, uh, well...

84
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:26,705
Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
I can't fly!

85
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,375
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:30,885
Just last week you went into
that wicked nose dive

87
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:33,375
to save that falling baby bird
right before it hit the ground!

88
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,005
But that was different,
that was an emergency!

89
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:39,525
This whole tornado thing,
it's more like a performance.

90
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:42,455
And you know how I hate performing
in front of others.

91
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:44,405
Don't you remember flight camp?

92
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:46,805
I couldn't gallop hard, or fly fast.

93
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:49,115
Not with everypony looking at me!

94
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,075
It wasn't that bad.

95
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,715
You're right, Rainbow Dash,
it wasn't bad.

96
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:55,555
<i>It was horrible!</i>

97
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:09,005
<i>All the other foals
used to tease me</i>

98
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:10,455
<i>a lot!</i>

99
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:15,245
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

100
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,905
I just can't risk that
sort of humiliation again.

101
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:24,385
Suck it up, Fluttershy!
This is no time for-

102
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:27,855
I mean, confidence or no confidence,

103
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:32,345
I'm gonna need every pegasus
to break the record, including you.

104
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:35,455
I need every ounce of wing power
I can get.

105
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:38,945
I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...

106
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:42,055
Thanks anyway.

107
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,375
Wait.

108
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,125
I'll do it.

109
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,915
- You will?
- I will.

110
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:52,525
- You're game?
- I'm game.

111
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,425
Alright!

112
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:04,255
What exactly does this machine do?

113
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:06,155
This is an anemometer.

114
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:09,285
It measures your accelerative velocity
and translates it into wing power.

115
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:12,765
Thus gauging your cumulative H2O
anti-gravitational potential.

116
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:14,835
Any other questions?

117
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:16,285
Yeah.

118
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,465
What exactly does this machine do?

119
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:22,465
It tells you how fast you're flying
and how strong your wings are.

120
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:29,435
Is that you again, Thunderlane?

121
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:33,075
Please, we need to have
a germ-free environment.

122
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,315
It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth.

123
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,045
Don't worry, Twilight.

124
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:40,785
Thunder Lane is just cooking up an excuse
to spend tornado day in bed.

125
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:44,285
Why don't you get over here
and be our first test flier, Thunderlane?

126
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,385
We have 9.3 wing power.

127
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,485
Wow! That's fast!

128
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:01,085
Yeah!

129
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,655
Not bad...not bad.

130
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:25,745
16.5 wing power!

131
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,425
Now listen up!

132
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,665
If each of you can get your numbers
up to at least 10.0 wing power

133
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:34,815
by the end of the week,

134
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:37,295
we'll no doubt set
a new tornado speed record.

135
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,745
We'll be number one!

136
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:09,325
Impressive.
Fluttershy, your turn.

137
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:32,845
Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly...

138
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:43,515
- Tell her!
- No, you tell her!

139
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:44,765
No, you!

140
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:51,305
Great job, Fluttershy!
You measured... point five.

141
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:55,365
Point five? Isn't that like...
less than one?

142
00:09:57,235 --> 00:10:01,685
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

143
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:12,215
Fluttershy, wait!

144
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:16,615
So some punks poked a little fun at you
and you got stage fright, big deal.

145
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:19,175
You aren't gonna go quit
just because of that, are you?

146
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,615
Yes!

147
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:24,965
But I need you!

148
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:29,655
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just
don't have the courage right now...

149
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:59,435
Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid
a couple of little acorns won't solve

150
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:01,465
my big flying problem.

151
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:07,485
I tried, but you should've seen
those ponies laughing at me...

152
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:12,085
I know it's important
to have confidence in myself...

153
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:17,875
Yes, yes, I do remember.
The river was swelling...

154
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,325
... and you were scared.

155
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:25,145
Yes, I did tell you to never give up

156
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,195
and to believe in yourself.

157
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:32,555
You're right, my friends.
I shouldn't give up.

158
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:36,975
I will get my confidence up and show
everypony that I am a good flyer!

159
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,585
A great flyer!

160
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:06,005
That's wonderful, Flitter.
Much better than yesterday.

161
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:09,785
This is crazy awesome!
We're gonna smash that record!

162
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:12,555
What'd he say?

163
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:14,845
Do I look like I speak squirrel?

164
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,625
What's that?

165
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:39,455
Two point three? Two point three?!

166
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:41,535
That has to be some kind of mistake!

167
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,625
I worked so hard!

168
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,335
Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!

169
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:49,005
You did awesome, Fluttershy.

170
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:52,225
No I didn't. I thought I'd
gotten over my nerves,

171
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,225
but they still got the best of me!

172
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,985
There's no way I'll fly with
10.0 wing power tomorrow!

173
00:13:58,145 --> 00:14:00,095
So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power.

174
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,855
Every bit counts!

175
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:05,355
How would you feel if everypony
else was flying with 10.0 wing power

176
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:08,105
and you were flying with 2.5?

177
00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:11,205
Actually, it was only 2.3, and- ow!

178
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:16,155
Well, uh... I'd feel...

179
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:19,615
Exactly! Humiliated!

180
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:22,885
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash,
I just can't do it!

181
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:25,185
It's okay, Rainbow Dash.

182
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:27,235
You've still got plenty of
wing power for your tornado.

183
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:29,935
You'll be able to lift tons of water up
to Cloudsdale!

184
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:36,185
If only there was a way to lift
Fluttershy out of the dumps...

185
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:53,135
Are we ready to do this?

186
00:14:58,435 --> 00:14:59,305
Look!

187
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:03,345
Lazy Thunderlane!
Where is he?!

188
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:06,255
He's been trying to get out
of tornado duty the whole time

189
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,805
with his fake coughing and all.

190
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,645
Rumble, where's your lazy brother?

191
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,185
He's got the feather flu.

192
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:13,125
He's down at Ponyville hospital.

193
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,385
But he's not the only one.

194
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:22,075
Let's see, with those eight sick pegasi
out with the feather flu...

195
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:23,345
Oh no!

196
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:26,195
Don't tell me we won't be able
to break the windspeed record?

197
00:15:26,345 --> 00:15:27,345
No...

198
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,125
You might not have enough wing power
to create a tornado powerful enough

199
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:34,535
to lift the water to Cloudsdale!

200
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,135
Well, should we pack up?

201
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:44,915
No. Of course not.
Forget the record.

202
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,325
Cloudsdale still needs water!

203
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:50,785
Okay, everypony,
let's give it all we've got!

204
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,275
On the sound of the horn, we take off!

205
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:12,335
You think they're gonna make it
to eight hundred wing power?

206
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:13,745
I sure hope so!

207
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,725
One hundred and fifty wing power.

208
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:17,695
Two hundred and fifty wing power.

209
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:21,815
Five hundred wing power!

210
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:27,455
Seven hundred and fifty wing power!

211
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:28,605
Twilight!

212
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,115
Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!

213
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:36,275
I figured, if I couldn't help
Rainbow Dash with the tornado,

214
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,825
the least I could do
was offer moral support!

215
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:41,665
She could sure use it,
considering eight pegasi

216
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,675
are sick with the feather flu!

217
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:46,275
Oh no! That's terrible news!

218
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,215
Are you okay?

219
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:10,565
I'm fine!

220
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:14,255
You were so close to the
eight hundred wing power minimum!

221
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:16,515
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.

222
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:20,705
We've got to try again!

223
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:23,255
But you've pushed your crew
to their limit already!

224
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:26,145
If you break apart again,
somepony could get hurt!

225
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,485
You should quit, it's not safe!

226
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,655
No! One more time!

227
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,585
I've gotta know we gave it our all!

228
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:36,195
If I'm going down, I'm going down flying!

229
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:40,195
C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!

230
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:43,515
Yeah!

231
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:53,125
Okay, here we go...

232
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:55,155
One hundred wing power!

233
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,615
Two hundred... five hundred!

234
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:01,085
Stay in position!

235
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:03,675
Flap those wings! Faster!

236
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:05,915
Seven hundred!

237
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:11,355
Seven hundred and fifty wing power!

238
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:16,145
They fell apart right after this!

239
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,465
I'm too nervous to look!

240
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:22,925
C'mon! Just a little harder!

241
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:26,085
I can see the water
trying to funnel through!

242
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:29,275
Seven ninety five! We are so close!

243
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,845
Fluttershy, they need you up there!

244
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:34,485
I won't make a difference!

245
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,715
You can make a difference!

246
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:41,715
My measly 2.3 wing power
is still too little!

247
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:44,015
It's sticking at seven ninety five!

248
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,915
I don't know if they've got
any more in 'em!

249
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:49,365
Do it for Equestria!
Do it for Rainbow Dash!

250
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,145
Do it for yourself!

251
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,595
It's moving!
She's doing it!

252
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:26,635
Seven ninety eight!

253
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:29,395
She surpassed her best
wing power number!

254
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:39,855
<i>Fluttershy, Fluttershy,
Fluttershy can hardly fly!</i>

255
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,465
No!

256
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:45,225
What was that?

257
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,495
I think it was Fluttershy!

258
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:05,335
She did it! She did it!
They all did it!

259
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,985
Whoa, girl, take it easy!

260
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,885
Whuh, what? Did we do it?

261
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,075
Yeah, we did it!
You did it!

262
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,645
Great job, Fluttershy,
that was awesome!

263
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:48,095
Yeah, we couldn't have done it
without you.

264
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:49,445
Nice job, Rainbow Dash.

265
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:52,785
You may not have set a new record,
but you showed a lot of guts.

266
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:54,175
Thanks.

267
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:57,055
But if you wanna talk guts,
then you've gotta give it

268
00:20:57,205 --> 00:21:00,125
to my number one flyer,
Fluttershy!

269
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:03,035
Let's hear it for Fluttershy!

270
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:07,785
Fluttershy! Fluttershy!
Fluttershy can really fly!

271
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:12,695
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

272
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:15,225
<i>sometimes you can feel like
what you have to offer</i>

273
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,685
<i>is too little to make a difference.</i>

274
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:21,725
<i>But today, I learned that
everypony's contribution is important.</i>

275
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,315
<i>No matter how small.</i>

276
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:28,785
<i>If you just keep your head high,
do your best, and believe in yourself,</i>

277
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:30,895
<i>anything can happen.</i>
