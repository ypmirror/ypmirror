1
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:04,415
Attention, everypony!

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:05,835
ATTENTION!

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:08,635
The official Rainbow Dash
fan club will come to order.

4
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:11,475
Let's get right down to our
first order of business.

5
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:16,425
I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared
the most awesome pony in Ponyville.

6
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:17,915
I second the motion.

7
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:21,775
And might I add that if you looked up
the word "awesome" in the dictionary...

8
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:23,945
...there would be
a picture of Rainbow Dash.

9
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:27,145
I object!

10
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:31,005
I think the word
"awesome" is played out.

11
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,025
Rainbow Dash deserves better.

12
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:37,515
I motion that we declare her
the most stupendous pony!

13
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:40,285
"Stupendous"?
Is that the best you got?

14
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:42,685
I motion that we declare her...

15
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,165
...wonderrific!

16
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:46,715
-Astonishing!
-Breathtaking!

17
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:49,415
-Astounding!
-Bedazzling!

18
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:52,155
What about superultraextremawesomeazing?

19
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:58,415
All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash
the most superultraextra...

20
00:00:58,415 --> 00:01:02,715
...uh, whatever you said,
pony in all of Ponyville, say aye.

21
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:03,975
AYE!

22
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:55,115
What a beautiful day.

23
00:01:55,685 --> 00:02:00,635
There's nothing like a dip in the clouds
to make a pegasus feel super-relaxed.

24
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:02,605
Help! Help!

25
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:05,125
Help! Heeelp!

26
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:08,405
Looks like my sky swim
will have to wait.

27
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:14,095
I'm Rainbow Dash
and I'm here to rescue you!

28
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,435
Wow. What's with this crowd?

29
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,465
Uh... Thanks everypony.

30
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:29,385
It was really no big deal.

31
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:33,495
To me it was.
You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!

32
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,875
That Rainbow Dash sure is something.

33
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,595
Something special.

34
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,815
Oh no! There's something
wrong with the baby!

35
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:32,525
She's not cheering for everypony's
favorite hero: Rainbow Dash!

36
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,085
There just aren't enough
words in the dictionary...

37
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:50,865
...to describe Rainbow
Dash's awesomeness.

38
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:53,055
I can think of a few new words.

39
00:03:53,055 --> 00:03:55,925
And I bet "modest" is not one of them.

40
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:04,455
No, but she is kinda awesome.

41
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:20,265
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood
Rainbow Dash is here!

42
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:36,115
-We'd be lost without you!
-You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!

43
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:39,125
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

44
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,685
I can't hear you!

45
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:44,765
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

46
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:52,215
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!
RAINBOW DASH! RAINBOW DASH!

47
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:55,045
Call me silly, but I think
this whole hero thing...

48
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,965
...might be going
to Rainbow Dash's head.

49
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:59,545
You may be right... silly.

50
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:04,015
And then I zoomed into the well.

51
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:07,945
I knew it would be dark and dangerous,
but I didn't let that stop me.

52
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:11,835
Danger's my middle name:
Rainbow Danger Dash.

53
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:15,835
Thinking back on it, I acted pretty
awesomely heroic that day.

54
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:17,205
"...that day."

55
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:21,005
Awesomely heroic that day and
awesomely arrogant ever since.

56
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:26,475
Hey, Applejack! How'd you like
to be immortalized as my friend?

57
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:27,775
Immorta-what?

58
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:32,455
Are you taking notes?

59
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:35,135
Yep! I've been hoof-picked
by Rainbow Dash herself...

60
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,925
...to write her autobiography.

61
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:41,485
Um... Autobiographies are supposed to
be written by the pony they are about.

62
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:44,515
Maybe for your normal,
run-of-the-mill ponies.

63
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:48,125
But I'm far too busy saving
lives to stop and write.

64
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,635
That's why I hired
Spike as my ghostwriter.

65
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,675
Aaah! Spike's a ghost!

66
00:05:55,105 --> 00:06:00,325
Anyway, Spike here writes down
everything I say. Don't you, Spike?

67
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:03,925
"Don't you, Spike?"
Got it!

68
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:07,385
This way I can stay focused on
performing those acts of bravery...

69
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:09,965
...that nopony else
has the guts to perform.

70
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,905
Yeah, it takes guts.

71
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,705
But it also takes brains.

72
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:15,955
And sometimes a big lunch and a nap.

73
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,115
Being a hero is surely
not for everypony...

74
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:21,465
...but I'm up to the challenge.

75
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:29,855
'ere you go.

76
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:33,255
Someday I wanna be just like you.

77
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:36,365
Aim high, kid, but don't
aim for the impossible.

78
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:42,005
Help! Heeelp!

79
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:44,695
Uh... Don't you think
you should go and help?

80
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,885
Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds
to spare. Just a couple more.

81
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,405
"The tension is unbearable."

82
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,915
"Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?"

83
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:21,545
Holy turnips! That pony
came out of nowhere!

84
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,595
I've never seen such
bravery in all my life!

85
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:28,235
That's right. Ponyville has a new hero.

86
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:32,935
A mysterious mare, that has
done well by our fair city today.

87
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:38,165
I dub this new masked hero
the Mysterious Mare Do Well!

88
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:42,475
Mare Do Well, huh?

89
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:46,245
Well, that mare would do well
to stay out of my way.

90
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:51,245
Ponyville's only got room for
one hero and that hero is me!

91
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:11,285
Never fear! Your friendly
neighborhood Rainbow...

92
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:14,325
Excuse me! Do you think
you could skip your catchphrase...

93
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,525
...and just hurry up and save us?

94
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:17,945
Ugh... Fine.

95
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,505
Picky, picky.

96
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,845
Oh, thank you, Mare Do... Well...

97
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,535
I can't believe it!

98
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:51,345
Mare Do Well is stronger than me?

99
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:54,895
Well, a hero is more than just muscle.

100
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:57,915
And she's gonna learn that the hard way.

101
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:24,495
Never fear, your friendly neighbor...

102
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:33,395
Never fear...

103
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:36,305
I'm coming!

104
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,005
Hold on!

105
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,625
Look!

106
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:06,395
Look out for the...!

107
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:08,195
Watch out for falling...!

108
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:11,115
Watch your left! Left!
Your other left!

109
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:15,535
Here you go. Safe and sound.

110
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:25,615
Well, Mare Do Well, or should I
call you Mare Do Slow?

111
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,305
You're gonna have to pick up the pace,
if you wanna compete with me...

112
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:30,185
...cause I move like lightning.

113
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:34,415
Actually, she saved all of us.
We owe her our lives.

114
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:48,465
Okay. She's strong, fast and somehow
knows what's gonna happen ahead of time.

115
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,275
I gotta step up my game.

116
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:05,395
If the dam breaks, the whole
town will be flooded!

117
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:08,355
Looks like Ponyville needs a hero!

118
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:14,145
Easy-peasy. My game
is officially back on.

119
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:16,775
If only somepony were here
to pat me on the back.

120
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,725
Huh. Guess I'll have to do it myself.

121
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:26,955
Heeelp!

122
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,265
Heeelp!

123
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:39,975
You?!

124
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:43,755
Huh. I *suppose* you
want me to thank...

125
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,645
You gotta be kidding me.

126
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,865
Let me get this straight.

127
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,925
She's strong, she's agile...

128
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,555
...and she's magic?!

129
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:17,835
How do I compete with THAT?!

130
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:20,905
Wait a minute.

131
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,745
I do have a leg up on her.

132
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:23,865
And that leg is...

133
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:25,795
Wings!

134
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:30,345
Ha! Take that, Mare Do Well!

135
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:41,405
Oh, for the love of Pete...

136
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:44,885
Gotta hand it to the girl.

137
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:48,315
That Mare Do Well sure can pull out
some pretty pretty heroic feats.

138
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,935
I must say I was impressed by that
spell she used to fix the dam.

139
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:56,005
Seems like something like that
would take quite a bit of study.

140
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:00,905
She really cares about
everypony's safety.

141
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,315
Have you seen her costume?
It is to die for!

142
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,825
If you ask me, she's a hero of fashion.

143
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:09,015
And she's modest and humble.

144
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:11,645
She lets her actions
speak for themselves.

145
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:12,895
Gotta admire that.

146
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,925
I don't have to admire that!

147
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:16,995
I don't think she's all that great.

148
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,235
"She's great."

149
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:19,745
I didn't say that.

150
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,215
Sounds like somepony's jealous.

151
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:23,515
Who? Me?

152
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:24,965
"Rainbow Dash is jealous."

153
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:26,935
Don't write that, Spike!

154
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:34,145
"Correction: Rainbow Dash
is very jealous."

155
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,235
Fine! Laugh all you want!

156
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:40,465
But I'll be the one laughing when I prove
to you all that I'm just as good...

157
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:44,175
...no, that I'm a better
hero than Mare Do Well!

158
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:54,485
No sign of trouble here, darn it.

159
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:58,905
Buses and baby carriages are always
careening down this hill.

160
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:02,405
Where is an out-of-control vehicle
when you need one?!

161
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,895
There are absolutely no freak natural
disasters going on anywhere!

162
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:11,315
How am I supposed to prove myself
when everything's so normal and safe?

163
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:14,525
Hold it right there, Granny Smith!

164
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,025
You don't have to pretend with me.

165
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,715
I can see you're way
over your head here.

166
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:20,965
Yes, what's that?

167
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:23,625
You're putting on
a brave face! I get it.

168
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,525
But you don't have to anymore.

169
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,785
I'll help you cross the street.

170
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:32,355
Actually, I can cross
the street just fine.

171
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:38,615
Don't worry! You're
in extremely capable hooves!

172
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,955
Stop! Back off! Back off!

173
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,835
Here we are! Safe and sound.

174
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:53,495
A good and heroic citizen
deserves a little recognition.

175
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:54,855
Don't you think?

176
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,895
I didn't want to cross
the street in the first place!

177
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,685
Somepony's in trouble!

178
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:13,005
You'd better let me handle this, ma'am.

179
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:16,825
For your own safety I must
ask you to stand back.

180
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,335
Oh, brother.

181
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,545
Ta-da!

182
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,365
Uh, thanks.

183
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,285
How would you describe what I just did?

184
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:48,325
Would you say I was... amazing?

185
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,165
Aren't you milking this a bit?

186
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:51,845
Please, just answer the question.

187
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:53,965
Was I or was I not amazing?

188
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:56,445
Oh, you're amazing,
all right. An amazingly...

189
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:57,785
Oh, look!

190
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:08,005
Another great feat of heroism.

191
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,505
I have just saved that grass!

192
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:11,685
From what?

193
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,695
From weeds!

194
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:16,675
Weeds that were attempting
to eat this lawn.

195
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:19,715
Lame.

196
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:26,075
Oh, who am I kidding?

197
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:37,935
All anypony talks about is
Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that.

198
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:39,425
What about me?

199
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:42,965
How could everypony forget
about me so easily?

200
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,635
I mean, have I changed?

201
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,535
Same sleek body...

202
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:49,185
Same flowing mane...

203
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:51,235
Same spectacular hooves...

204
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:53,725
Nope! I'm still awesome.

205
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:55,495
They're wrong.

206
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:59,155
But... then why am I all alone?

207
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:02,135
I hate being all alone.

208
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:06,195
-Hey, Rainbow Dash!
-I knew it!

209
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:11,345
No need to apologize, squirt.
Anypony could make a mistake.

210
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:13,975
Mistake? What mistake?

211
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,535
Wait a minute. Why are you here?

212
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:19,105
To invite you to join us.

213
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:22,685
We're heading off to the thank you
parade for Ponyville's greatest hero:

214
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:24,105
Mare Do Well.

215
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:29,935
No! No way! Can't you see I...
I wanna be alone? I love being alone!

216
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,615
Oh. Okay. See you later, then.

217
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:35,595
Yeah, right. Like I'm gonna thank *her*.

218
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:39,155
Thank you, Mare Do Well,
whoever you are, for ruining e...

219
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:42,585
Hey, squirt! Wait up!

220
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:48,625
Welcome to Ponyville's first,
but surely not last...

221
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:53,925
...thank you parade in honor of our
city's greatest hero, the Mysterious...

222
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:55,785
...Mare Do Well!

223
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:04,875
The Mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?

224
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,935
So what are you hiding?

225
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:11,225
Let's see how mysterious
you are without that mask.

226
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,415
What a hay?

227
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:58,985
I got you now!

228
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:04,335
All right, Miss Mysterious.

229
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:05,615
Mystery...

230
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,235
...solved!

231
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,135
P-P-P-P-Pinkie?!

232
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,355
Twilight?!

233
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,125
Applejack?!

234
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,365
There were three of you?

235
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:31,595
Yep. We all played
Mare Do Well at different times.

236
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:34,165
I stopped the carriage bus
with these babies.

237
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:37,005
Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.

238
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:40,425
I saved the construction
workers with my Pinkie sense.

239
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,205
-Sorry.
-It's alright.

240
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:48,895
And I used my magic to fix the dam.

241
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:52,195
Ooh! Ooh! And I did
the flyby afterwards.

242
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:56,065
I made the costumes.
Fabulous if I do say so myself.

243
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:59,475
I don't understand.

244
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:00,825
Why?!

245
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,945
Don't you want me to be a hero?

246
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:05,565
Of course we want you to be a hero.

247
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:08,195
But a real hero doesn't brag.

248
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:11,365
Uh, I guess I did start
to brag a little.

249
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:13,345
A LITTLE?!

250
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,525
Okay, a lot.

251
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:19,795
Celebrating your accomplishments
is natural, but...

252
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:22,905
Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.

253
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:27,245
Yeah! The only thing that should be rubbed
in anypony's face is chocolate cake.

254
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,575
I think we're gettin' off topic here.

255
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:38,625
What we're trying to say is it's great
to be really good at something...

256
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,665
...but it's important to act
with grace and humility.

257
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:47,565
Oh! That makes loads more sense!

258
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,095
Yeah. You're right.

259
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:54,685
And I guess I should also act with grace
and humility when others outshine me.

260
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,375
Like... Mare Do Well.

261
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,705
Sounds like you've got a letter
to write to Princess Celestia.

262
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:02,225
Already got it covered.

263
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:05,265
As your ghostwriter, I've already
penned a letter to the princess.

264
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:09,715
That's nice of you, Spike, but I really
wanna write this letter myself.

265
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:13,535
Aw, come on! I wrote the whole thing already!

266
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:15,565
Okay. Let's hear it.

267
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:18,795
-"Dear Princess Cel..."
-Look out!

268
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:20,965
It's a real ghost!

269
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:36,855
