1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,200
Lots of control...
Good.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,910
...Screaming
and hollering.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,210
Yes.
And most importantly...

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,960
...Passion.
Right.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,670
So, now that you know
the elements of a good cheer,

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,040
let's hear one!

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,210
Yay.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,170
Ugh!

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,550
You're gonna cheer for me
like that?

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,260
Louder.
Yay.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,760
Louder!
Yay.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,600
Louder!!

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,890
yay.

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,980
Ugh!

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,690
Too loud?

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,940
* My Little Pony

17
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,780
* My Little Pony

19
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,780
* My Little Pony

20
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,120
* I used to wonder
What friendship could be *

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,780
* My Little Pony

22
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,290
* Until you all shared
This magic with me *

23
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,660
* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

24
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,830
* A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong *

25
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,290
* Sharing kindness
* It's an easy feat

26
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,840
* And magic
Makes it all complete *

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,010
* Yeah, My Little Pony

28
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:10,010
* Do you know you're all
My very best friends? *

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,730
Yay.

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,650
And now phase one
of my routine.

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,780
Ooh.

32
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,740
Phase two.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,880
Way to go.

34
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,350
Here we go -- Phase three,
the sonic rainboom.

35
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,360
Come on!

36
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,660
Uh-oh.

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,870
Wh-o-o-oa!

38
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,490
Last one.

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,620
Thank you so much for
helping me clean up
all these books, guys.

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,120
It was a crazy weekend
of studying.

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,540
Wh-o-o-o-oa!

42
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,550
Aah!

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,470
Rainbow Dash,
you rock.

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,550
Whoo-hoo.

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,890
Did my cheering do that?

46
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,350
Sorry about that,
ladies.

47
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,350
That was a truly feeble
performance.

48
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,060
Actually,
it wasn't all bad.

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,360
I particularly liked it
when you made the clouds spin.

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,860
Ugh. I'm not talking
about my performance --

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,950
I'm talking about yours --
That feeble cheering.

52
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,660
What are you two
arguing about?

53
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,120
Were we arguing?
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,700
Ugh. I wish you guys
could come to Cloudsdale

55
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,660
to see me compete in the
best young flier competition.

56
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,000
What's that?

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,040
It's where all the greatest
pegasus fliers get together

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,750
and show off
their different flying styles.

59
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,380
Some are fast!

60
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,170
Eeeeeeee!

61
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,130
And some are graceful.

62
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,720
Whoa! Whoa!

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,010
Wh-o-o-oa!

64
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,470
Ooh!

65
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,640
Golly.

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,100
I'd love to see you strut
your stuff in that competition.

67
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,520
Yeah. I wish you guys
could be there.

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,060
Fluttershy's
a great support,

69
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,610
but her cheering
isn't exactly inspirational.

70
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,860
Ooh! I'd love to see you make
a sonic rainboom!

71
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,940
It's, like,
the most coolest thing ever,

72
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,400
even though
I've never actually seen it,

73
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,030
but, I mean, come on!
It's a sonic rainboom!

74
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,530
How n cool could it
possibly not be?

75
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,750
What's a sonic rainboom?

76
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,540
You really need to
get out more.

77
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
The sonic rainboom
is legendary!

78
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,670
when a pegasus like Rainbow Dash
gets going so fast --

79
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,050
Boom! --

80
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,210
A sonic boom and a rainbow
can happen all at once!

81
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,720
And Rainbow Dash here's

82
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,800
the only pony
to ever pull it off.

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,640
It was a long time ago.

84
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,060
I-I was just a filly.

85
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,600
Yeah, but you're gonna do it
again, right?

86
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,100
A-are you kidding?

87
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,610
I'm the greatest flier
to ever come out of Cloudsdale.

88
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,230
I could do sonic rainbooms
in my sleep.

89
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,400
Wow.

90
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,610
If you pull that off,
you'll win the crown for sure.

91
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,740
The grand prize is an entire day
with the Wonderbolts --

92
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,120
A whole day of flying
with my lifelong heroes.

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
It'll be a dream come true!

94
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,210
Yay.

95
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm gonna go rest up.

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,920
Don't want to overprepare
myself, you know?

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,840
You, on the other hand,
better keep practicing.

98
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,970
I need
a cheering section

99
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,600
to match my spectacular
performance.

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,970
She's practiced that move
a hundred times,

101
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,560
and she's never even come close
to doing it.

102
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,480
I don't know if I can cheer
loud enough to help her.

103
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,110
Well, guess we better get this
cleaned up...

104
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,230
again.

105
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,110
Go on. Go on.

106
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,400
"Go on" what?

107
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,160
Find a spell that will get us
wingless ponies into Cloudsdale.

108
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,700
Didn't you see
how nervous she was?

109
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,490
Nervous?

110
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,120
Have you spit your bit
or something?

111
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,160
She was tooting
her own horn

112
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,210
louder than the brass section
of a marching band.

113
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,710
Oh, puh-lease.

114
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,630
I have put on
enough fashion shows

115
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,800
to recognize stage fright
when I see it.

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,090
We've got to find a way
to be there for her.

117
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,880
Now, go on!
Aah!

118
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,180
Ugh!

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,260
How am I supposed to find
a flight spell in this mess?

120
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,930
A flight spell?
One sec.

121
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,230
Page 27.

122
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,270
How'd you do that?
It landed on my face

123
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,980
when Rainbow Dash
knocked me into the bookcase.

124
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,980
Here it is -- a spell
that will allow earth ponies

125
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,240
to fly for three days.

126
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,610
Ohh, it looks really
difficult.

127
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm not sure I can do it.

128
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
You've got to try.

129
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,620
Okay, but who's gonna volunteer
to be the test subject?

130
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,830
I will!

131
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,630
For Rainbow Dash,
I will go first.

132
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,920
Here goes.

133
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,310
Aah!

134
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,070
I think it worked.

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,320
You've got to learn
to be assertive, Fluttershy.

136
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,950
Don't be afraid
to speak up.

137
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,170
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

138
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,300
It's our old friend
Rainbow Crash.

139
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,800
Get kicked out
of any flight schools lately?

140
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,800
I didn't get kicked out.

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,680
Face it,
Rainbow Crash --

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,890
Flight school
had too many rules

143
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,100
and not enough naptimes
for you.

144
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,850
Ask her about
the sonic rainboom.

145
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,020
That's nothing
but an old mare's tail.

146
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,860
You don't have the skills
to try something like that.

147
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,650
Now, wait just a minute.

148
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,450
Oh, I'm sorry.

149
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,740
I'm trying to be
more assertive.

150
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,870
Anyhow, she is going to do
a sonic rainboom.

151
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,620
No, she's not,
'cause there's no such thing.

152
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,000
Then show up at the cloudiseum
and see for yourself.

153
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,710
Uh, if you're free.

154
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll be free.

155
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,380
Oh, don't worry.
We'll be there.

156
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,170
See you then,
Rainbow Crash.

157
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,050
Did you see that?
I was so assertive.

158
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,720
Those guys are right.

159
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
I'll never be able
to do it.

160
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,930
But, Rainbow Dash,

161
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,810
just because you failed
the sonic rainboom

162
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,730
100,000 times
in practice

163
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,060
doesn't mean
you won't be able to do it

164
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,900
in front of an entire stadium
full of impatient,

165
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,990
supercritical,
sports-fan ponies.

166
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,740
Aaah!

167
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,860
What do I do?!

168
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,370
Everypony's
gonna see me fail!

169
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,870
The Wonderbolts will never let
a loser like me join!

170
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,910
Princess Celestia
will probably banish me

171
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,000
to the Everfree Forest!

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,870
My life is ruined!!

173
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,250
Rar--

174
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,130
Rare?

175
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,920
The sonic rainboom
is way more than rare!

176
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,170
R-Rarity?

177
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,680
Rarity, are you...
flying?

178
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,310
I most certainly am!

179
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,730
Aren't my wings
smashing?

180
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,770
Twilight
made them for me.

181
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,230
I just adore them.

182
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,440
Why so shocked?

183
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,650
We couldn't leave
our favorite flier

184
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,320
without a big
cheering section.

185
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,030
"We"?

186
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,700
I-I can't believe it!

187
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,660
It's incredible!

188
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,040
This is so cool!
You guys made it!

189
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,290
Sure did!

190
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,170
Wait!

191
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,300
How'd you do that?

192
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,010
Only pegasus ponies
can walk on clouds.

193
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,680
Pretty cool, huh?

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,140
I found a spell that makes
temporary wings,

195
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,770
but it was too difficult
to do more than once,

196
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,060
so I found
an easier spell

197
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,980
that lets the rest of us
walk on clouds.

198
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,150
And we came
to cheer you to victory.

199
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,070
To be honest,
I was starting to get

200
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,150
just the teeniest,
tiniest bit nervous,

201
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,950
but I feel a lot better
now that you guys are here.

202
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,280
Hey, we've got some time
before the competition.

203
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,990
Why don't Fluttershy and I
show you around Cloudsdale?

204
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,450
Yeah!
All right!
That sounds lovely.

205
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,330
Great!
Wonderful.

206
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,290
Here it is -- The greatest city
in the sky.

207
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,250
Whoa!
Whoa!Whoa!
Whoa!

208
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,800
Ahh!
Ahh!Ahh!
Ahh!

209
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,220
Ooh!

210
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,050
Ahh!

211
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,720
Uh...

212
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,350
some of the greatest pegasi
in history came from Cloudsdale.

213
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,520
Oh, wait for me!

214
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,820
Those wings
are gorgeous.

215
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,820
Why, thank you.

216
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,950
Be careful
with those wings, Rarity.

217
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,990
They're made
from gossamer and morning dew,

218
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,990
and they're
incredibly delicate.

219
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,530
Don't worry, Twilight.

220
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm sure they can't get worn out
from too much attention.

221
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,330
Since we're up here,

222
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,920
I'd sure like to get a look
at where the weather's made.

223
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,830
Great idea.

224
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,090
Come on, girls --
to the weather factory!

225
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,970
This is where they make
the snowflakes.

226
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,890
Each one is hoofmade.

227
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,390
As you can see,
it's a delicate operation.

228
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,850
Ooh, the snowflakes
look even better from up here.

229
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,070
Oh, come on!

230
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,950
We'd better move on

231
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,330
before Rarity ruins winter
and causes a drought.

232
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,330
And here's
where they make the rainbows.

233
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,010
Spicy!

234
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,010
Yeah.

235
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,180
Rainbows aren't really known
for their flavor.

236
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,100
Whoa!

237
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,180
Oh, where'd you get
those amazing wings?

238
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,430
I want a pair.

239
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,430
Hmm.

240
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,440
Yeah, I guess
I could see that.

241
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,020
Oh, hey, look.
It's Rainbow Crash again.

242
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,190
Yeah.

243
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,070
Rainbow, uh...

244
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,610
Crash!

245
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,450
Rarity, what are you doing
talking to these guys?

246
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,450
Oh, they were just admiring
my wings, Rainbow Dash.

247
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,080
Yeah. You should forget
the sonic rainboom

248
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,540
and just get yourself
some wings like these.

249
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,210
Ohh.

250
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,590
Oh, come on, girls.

251
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,920
Why don't we go see
how clouds are made?

252
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,880
Don't listen to them.

253
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,220
You're gonna win
that competition for sure.

254
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,510
Are you kidding?

255
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,180
I can't do
the sonic rainboom.

256
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,940
and just look at these boring,
plain old feathered wings.

257
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,980
I'm doomed.

258
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,490
Ooh!
Wow.

259
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,120
What? These old things?

260
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,660
Go ahead, everypony.

261
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,540
Photos are encouraged.

262
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,000
Rarity, we're
supposed to be helping

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Rainbow Dash relax,
remember?

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,470
Put your wings away
and stop showing off.

265
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,630
Oh, how can you ask me
to put away perfection?

266
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,640
Ooh!
Ooh!Ooh!
Ooh!

267
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,520
Rainbow Dash,
are you okay?

268
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,020
You don't look so good.

269
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,980
Of course!
Why wouldn't I be okay?

270
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,150
Everyone's so in love
with Rarity's wings

271
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,650
that they won't even notice
when I totally blow it

272
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,660
in the best young fliers
competition.

273
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,530
Hey, there's an idea --

274
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,530
You should enter
the competition.

275
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,370
Yeah.

276
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,410
I could watch you fly
all day long.

277
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,370
There really isn't anypony

278
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,920
who uses their wings
quite like me.

279
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,460
Perhaps I should compete.

280
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,710
What?!

281
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,210
Oooh!
Oooh!Oooh!
Oooh!

282
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,470
That's amazing!

283
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,220
Wow!
Ooh!

284
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,600
What am I gonna do?

285
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,180
I'll never win
the competition now.

286
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,700
I'm going to be
awhile.

287
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Fillies and gentlecolts,

288
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,460
please rise and join me

289
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,590
in welcoming our beloved
Princess Celestia.

290
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,600
Please welcome
our celebrity judges

291
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,940
for the best young flier
competition,

292
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,690
the Wonderbolts!

293
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,580
And now let's find out
who will take the prize

294
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,040
as this year's best young flier.

295
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,090
Okay, contestant number 1.
You're up.

296
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Aah!

297
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,090
Okay, number 2.
Let's go.

298
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,840
Um...

299
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,430
Come on. Come on.
We ain't got all day.

300
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,850
She's talking to you.

301
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,730
Oh, uh...

302
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,560
Oh, I guess that's me.

303
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,570
Okay, number 4.
Time to go.

304
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,110
I'm number 4,

305
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
and I need just one more
itsy-bitsy minute.

306
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,740
Be a dear and have somepony
go ahead of me, hmm?

307
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,250
Look, I don't care who it is,
but somepony's got to go on.

308
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,080
Let's do this!

309
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,210
Uh...
what am I gonna do?

310
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,630
I love number 7.

311
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,550
Doing 15 barrel rolls in a row
can't be easy.

312
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,010
My favorite is number 10.

313
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,560
She just looked like
such a nice pony.

314
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,730
Wonder how come we haven't seen
Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet.

315
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,100
The competition's
almost over.

316
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,570
Number 15, let's go.

317
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,780
Rarity...is ready.

318
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,820
Look, ladies, I don't know
what to tell you.

319
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,910
There's only time
for one more performance.

320
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,080
If you both
want to compete,

321
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,750
you'll just have to go out there
together.

322
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,040
Well, Rainbow Dash,
shall we?

323
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,130
Uh...uh...
heh...heh.

324
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,960
And now for our final
competitor of the day,

325
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,630
contestant number 15!

326
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,090
Uh, and, apparently,
contestant number 4.

327
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,850
Good luck, Rainbow Dash.
Just do your best.

328
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,350
I hope you don't mind,
but I took the liberty
of changing our music.

329
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,810
That rock 'n' roll

330
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,020
doesn't really match
my wings.

331
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,950
Come on, Rainbow Dash.
You can do this.

332
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,820
Just remember the routine.

333
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,910
Phase one.

334
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,970
Aah!

335
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,390
Nice work,
Rainbow Crash!

336
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,810
Time for phase two.

337
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,030
Look.
Phase two is working.

338
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,380
And now
for my grand finale --

339
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,630
I will fly
right up to the sun

340
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,800
and beam my beautiful wings over
the whole city of Cloudsdale.

341
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,300
Oh, they'll be talking about it
for years!

342
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,100
Looks like this is my last
chance to turn things around.

343
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,400
Phase three --
The sonic rainboom.

344
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,860
Wings, don't fail me now.

345
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,660
Look upon me, Equestria,

346
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,040
for I am Rarity!

347
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,720
Uh-oh.

348
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,050
Aah!

349
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,140
Oh, no!

350
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,310
Her wings evaporated
into thin air!

351
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,100
Aah!

352
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,690
Aaaaah!

353
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,360
Ohh!
Aah!
Ohh!

354
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,940
Aaaaaaah!

355
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,240
Hold on, Rarity!
I'm coming!

356
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,160
Aaaah!

357
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,120
I can't look.

358
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,010
A sonic rainboom!

359
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,220
She did it!

360
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,390
She did it!

361
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,020
Whoo!!

362
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,360
Whoa.

363
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,880
A sonic rainboom!

364
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,380
Whoo!! Yeah!!

365
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,130
I did it.

366
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,880
I did it!

367
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,050
You sure did.

368
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,220
Oh, thank you,
Rainbow Dash.

369
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,760
You saved my life.

370
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,890
Well, yeah.
I did that, too.

371
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,310
Best day ever!

372
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,440
I want to apologize
to all of you

373
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,990
for getting so carried away
with my beautiful wings.

374
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,070
I guess
I just lost my head.

375
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,240
It's okay, Rarity.
Oh, don't worry
about it, kiddo.

376
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
We still love you.

377
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,910
And I'm especially sorry
that I was so thoughtless

378
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,160
as to jump into the contest
at the last minute

379
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,160
after you had worked
so hard to win it.

380
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,960
Can you ever, ever
forgive me?

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,920
Aww, it's okay.

382
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Everything turned out
all right, right?

383
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,590
I just wish I could have
met the Wonderbolts
when they were awake.

384
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,010
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

385
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,260
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

386
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,430
So, you're the little pony
who saved our lives.

387
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,100
We really wanted to meet you
and say thanks.

388
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,350
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

389
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,060
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

390
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,440
Princess.

391
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,610
Hello,
Twilight Sparkle,

392
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,070
and hello
to your friends, too.

393
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,900
Princess Celestia...

394
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,320
I'm sorry
I ruined the competition.

395
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,200
Rainbow Dash here really is
the best flier in Equestria.

396
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,620
I know she is, my dear.

397
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,620
That's why, for her
incredible act of bravery

398
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,080
and her spectacular
sonic rainboom,

399
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,210
I'm presenting the grand prize
for best young flier

400
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,340
to this year's winner,
Ms. Rainbow Dash.

401
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,550
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

402
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,590
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

403
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,140
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

404
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,470
So, Twilight Sparkle,
did you learn anything

405
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,470
about friendship
from this experience?

406
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,140
I did, Princess,

407
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,980
but I think Rarity learned
even more than me.

408
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,440
I certainly did.

409
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,230
I learned
how important it is

410
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,150
to keep your hooves
on the ground

411
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,980
and be there
for your friends.

412
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,990
Excellent.
Well done, Rarity.

413
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,660
This really is
the best day ever!

414
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,330
Uh, hey,
Rainbow Crash.

415
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,330
Dash!

416
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,160
Oh, uh, sorry.
Rainbow Dash.

417
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,160
We just wanted
to congratulate you

418
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,920
on winning
the competition.

419
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,670
That sonic rainboom
was awesome!

420
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,340
Thanks, guys.

421
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,550
Uh, we're really sorry

422
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,630
we gave you
such a hard time before.

423
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,010
Aww, that's okay.

424
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,260
Don't worry about it.

425
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,180
Hey, do you want to
hang out with us?

426
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,010
Maybe you could show us how you
did that incredible trick.

427
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,020
Sorry, boys...

428
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,020
...but I've got plans.

429
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,530
* My Little Pony

430
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,860
* My Little Pony

431
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,290
* My Little Pony

432
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,340
* Friends
