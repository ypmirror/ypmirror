1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,660
Aah!

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:08,370
I! Can't! Believe! The grand!
Galloping! Gala! Is! Tonight!

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,350
Pinkie,
please stop shouting.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,830
I'm trying to concentrate.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,570
Pinkie Pie,
stop that right now.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,670
It's time to prepare
for the gala,

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,190
And I refuse to let you
put on your new dress

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,850
When you're all sweaty.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,570
What's Twilight doing?

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,330
She's got an awesome
magic spell

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,630
She's been working on
for the gala.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,650
Where are the others?
It's getting late.

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,690
Hold your horses, girl.
We're here.

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,810
Perfect. I'm ready.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,860
For what?
All right, Spike.

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,870
An apple!
Are we having Pie?

17
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,510
Shh! Watch.

18
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,690
Awesome!
Lovely!

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,870
Ooh!
Thanks.

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,330
But that's
just the start.

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,310
Fluttershy,
did you bring your friends?

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,190
Yes.

23
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,290
Will they be safe,
Twilight?

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,070
You have my word.

25
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,630
Ta-Da!

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,390
Oh.
Oh.
Uh...

27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,070
Interesting.

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,230
Neat, huh?
And don't worry.

29
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,770
They'll be mice again
at midnight.

30
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,230
Opalescence, no!

31
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,540
Wait! Come back!

32
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,990
Those horses were supposed to
pull our carriage.

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,570
How will we get to the gala?

34
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,270
Whatever shall we do?

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,170
Uh...
excuse me.

36
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,210
Uh, would you boys mind pulling
our carriage to the gala?

37
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,010
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,600
Right.

39
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:59,690
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
we have muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

40
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,590
Ooh!

41
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,150
Aw. Come on, you guys.

42
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,570
Let me in!

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,770
Sure thing, Spike.

44
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,130
Heavens, no!
We're getting dressed.

45
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,190
Dressed?

46
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,610
Uh, beg your pardon,
Rarity,

47
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,690
But we don't normally
wear clothes.

48
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,430
I'm sorry, Spike.
Some of us do have standards.

49
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,810
I still can't believe

50
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,490
We're going to be at Canterlot
tonight, our hometown, Twilight.

51
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,750
And the best part is

52
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,470
That we all get to hang out
together all night long!

53
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,470
I don't know, Spike.

54
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,470
We'll just have to see.

55
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,550
We're gonna be
a might busy.

56
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,430
Busy having fun!

57
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,170
Oh. Okay.

58
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,310
Don't worry, Spike.

59
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,430
We'll all get to spend
some time together.

60
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,630
Great!

61
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,890
'Cause I planned out
my insider's tour of Canterlot.

62
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,770
I've got to show Rarity
the crown jewels

63
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,890
And Applejack the princess'
golden apple tree.

64
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,650
And, Pinkie, we got to go
to my favorite doughnut shop.

65
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,370
All right!

66
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,250
Sounds good, Spike.

67
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,170
Show me around.

68
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,530
Then let's get moving.
Hyah!

69
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,250
Excuse me?!

70
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,970
Um, I...

71
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,750
if you weren't friends
with our neighbor Rarity...

72
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,430
hmph!

73
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,830
Whoa!

74
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,890
You all look...amazing.

75
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,950
I can't believe
we're finally here.

76
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,530
With all that we've imagined,

77
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,530
The reality of this night
is sure to make this

78
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,690
The best night ever!

79
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,830

80
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,810

* at the gala

93

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,930

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,270
* give me some
* caramel apples, apple sweets

96
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,630
* and I'll earn a lot of money
for the Apple family *

97
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,390
* all our dreams and our hopes
from now until hereafter *

98
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,930

for will happen at the gala *

99
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,810

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,410
* and he'll guarantee we'll be

105
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,670

106
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,810
* this is what we've waited for,

107
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,030

108
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,030

* I am here at the grand gala,

Yeah! This is gonna be

149
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,270
You know why?

150
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,350
'Cause we're all gonna spend
time at the gala to--

151
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,490
Whoa!

152
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,810
--Gether.

153
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,770
Or not.

154
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,130
Princess Celestia.

155
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,570
Twilight.

156
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,350
It is so lovely
to see my star student.

157
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,170
Oh, I'm so excited
to be here.

158
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,170
We have so much
to catch up on.

159
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,070
Well, I want you right
by my side the entire evening

160
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,670
So we'll have plenty
of time together.

161
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,190
That's just what I was hoping
you'd say.

162
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,750
Hurry, Rarity.
But not too fast.

163
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,990
I don't want to lose him.

164
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,910
Have to play it cool.

165
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,330
Oh, but don't be cold!

166
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,150
I can't lose him! I can't!
He's everything I imagined!

167
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,630
Even better than I imagined.

168
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,950
Oh, my.

169
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,330
A meadow lark.

170
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,530
I think she's calling to me.

171
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,870
It's exactly what I wished for.

172
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,850
* ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah

173
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,390
Howdy, partner.
You hungry?

174
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,310
As a horse!

175
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,010
Well,
what you hankerin' for?

176
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,970
Carmel apple? Apple Pie?
Apple fritter? Apple fries?

177
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,310
I'll take
that big apple Pie!

178
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,250
Well,
thank you kindly, sir.

179
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,990
Yee-Haw!

180
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,050
In the first minute,

181
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,510
I made my first sale,
just like I expected.

182
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,330
Always hungry after a show,
eh, soren?

183
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,570
Yeah!

184
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,890
My Pie!

185
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,170
You saved it. Thanks.

186
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,130
Hey, no prob.

187
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,530
Hey, I know you.

188
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,690
You're the pony that saved us
in cloudsdale

189
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,370
And won the best-Flier
competition.

190
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,770
Hey, yeah.
Name's Rainbow Dash.

191
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,450
Well, Rainbow Dash, looks like
your skills saved us again.

192
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,350
Well, at least,
they saved Soren's apple pie.

193
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,770
Yeah!

194
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,830
Want to come
hang out with us?
Sure. Why not?

195
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,910
I'm hanging
with the Wonderbolts!

196
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,290
Oh! The shiny dance floor!

197
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,090
The pretty party ponies!

198
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,970
Ooh! The fancy band!

199
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,990
Shiny, pretty, fancy!

200
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,070
Got to dance!

201
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,710
* I'm at
the grand galloping gala *

202
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,530
* I'm at
the grand galloping gala *

203
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,990
* I'm at
the grand galloping gala *

204
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,790
* it's all I ever dreamed

205
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,550
* it's all I ever dreamed
whoo-Hoo! *

206
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,170
* it's all I ever dreamed
yippee! *

207
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,650
* I'm at the grand galloping
gala-A-A-A-A-A-A *

208
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,930
* it's all I've ever dreamed?

209
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,490
Well, hello.
I am prince Blueblood.

210
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,890
I am Rarity.

211
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,310
Oh, my,
what a lovely rose.

212
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,190
You mean...

213
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,310
this rose?

214
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,090
Thank you.

215
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,870
It goes with my eyes.

216
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,750
* ah-Ah-Ah-Ahh

217
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,470
My little meadow lark
is right around this bend.

218
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,910
Was that you?

219
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,710
Yep. I love whistling
while I work.

220
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,070
Oh. Yes, well, excuse me.

221
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,450
Oh, I see a toucan.

222
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,350
And a spider monkey.

223
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,790
And, oh, is that a wallaroo?

224
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,630
Oh, Fluttershy,
you're such a loudmouth.

225
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,790
Hey!

226
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,370
Have you ever done a rain cloud
double back flip?

227
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,150
Have you ever
swerved past lightning?

228
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,230
It's awesome!

229
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,910
Welcome to
the grand galloping gala.

230
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,930
Princess, I've been so excited
to spend time with you, and --

231
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,150
Yes, me too, twi--

232
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,550
Oh, good evening.
Welcome to the gala.

233
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,670
Which is why I --

234
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,570
Ladies.
Lovely to see you again.

235
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,870
Looks like getting a chance
to talk to the princess

236
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,050
Is gonna be
a magic trick in itself.

237
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,710
First minute, first sale.

238
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,330
Second.

239
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,910
Fourth.

240
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,330
Sixth.

241
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,890
60th minute, no sales.

242
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,210
this ain't what
I expected at all.

243
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,150
* I'm at
the grand galloping gala *

244
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,210
And it's not what I dreamed.

245
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,070
This isn't at all
what I imagined.

246
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,030
Good evening.

247
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,910
Welcome.

248
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,550
This isn't
what I hoped.

249
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,630
This isn't hanging out.

250
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,850
This isn't what I wished for.

251
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,230
No.

252
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,990
I waited all my life...

253
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,910
for this moment.

254
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,430
And I'm not going to...

255
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,450
let it slip by.

256
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,570
If it's the last thing I do...

257
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,070
I'm gonna make this...

258
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,810
The best night ever!

259
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,110
I just have to be more bold,
like Twilight says.

260
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,050
I'm so sorry to have scared you,
my friends.

261
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,630
But I'm leaving now,
so you can all come out.

262
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,190
Gotcha!

263
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,530
It's okay.
I promise not to hurt you.

264
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,470
I just want to be your --

265
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,510
Friend?

266
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,410
Mmm!
Sounds good to me.

267
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,170
Come on, Rainbow.

268
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,830
If they don't notice you, you
got to make them notice you!

269
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,370
Aah! Aah!

270
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,970
Aah!

271
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,350
Just give him a chance,
Rarity.

272
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,090
His princely side is sure to
come out if you're just patient.

273
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,950
Miss Rarity, stop!

274
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,810
Oh!

275
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,850
Prince blueblood,
how chivalrous.

276
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,310
One would hate to slip.

277
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,530
Yes, one certainly would.

278
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,150
One's cloak should take care
of the problem.

279
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,030
Oh, of course it will.

280
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,650
And then...
and then I want you to do this.

281
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,950
Come on, everypony!

282
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,850
I know what'll make you
shake those groove things!

283
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,470
* you reach your right hoof in

284
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,490
* you reach
your right hoof out *

285
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,890
* you reach your right hoof in,
and you shake it all about *

286
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,790
* you do the pony pokey, meeting
lots of folks with clout *

287
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,310
* that's what
I'm talking about *

288
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,990
* you step your left hoof in

289
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,010
* you pull it right back out

290
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,550
* you step your left hoof in,
but you better help him out *

291
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,450
* you do the pony pokey,
but you find a different crowd *

292
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,930
* that's what it's all about

293
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,590
* you kick your back left in

294
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,410
* you pull your back left out

295
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,190
* you reach your back left in

296
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,010
* just be brave
and have no doubt *

297
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,790
* you do the pony pokey

298
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,750
* feeling like
you're gonna pout *

299
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,370
* that's what
I'm singing about *

300
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,070
* you tilt your head in

301
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,050
* you tilt your head out

302
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,490
* you tilt your head in,
then you shake it all about *

303
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,210
* you do the pony pokey,
even though your date's a lout *

304
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,910
* you're better off without

305
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,650
* you stomp your whole self in

306
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,570
* you stomp
your whole self out *

307
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,070
* you stomp your whole self in,
and you stomp yourself about *

308
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,510
* you do the pony pokey,
and you give a little shout *

309
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,570
Come out!
* that's what
I'm talking about *

310
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,210
* you do the pony pokey

311
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,050
* you do the pony pokey

312
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,770
* you do the pony pokey

313
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,590
* and that's what
it's all about *

314
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,910
Yeah!

315
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,550
Young lady, this is not
that kind of party!

316
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,350
Oh-H-H-H-H.

317
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,990
They don't want to party.

318
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,230
These ponies
want to pa-A-A-Rty!

319
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,410
Two apple fritters,
please.

320
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,690
Two apple fritters
coming right up.

321
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,890
That'll be 4 bits.

322
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,350
Ahem.
Ahem.

323
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,970
Ahem.
Ahem.

324
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,150
I'm going to have to pay,
aren't i?

325
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,630
It's okay, Rarity.
I got you covered.

326
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,570
Thank you, Applejack.

327
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,170
At least some pony here
had good manners.

328
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,670
Blech! Ugh!

329
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,990
Fritters! Dumplings!
Caramel apples!

330
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,290
My royal lips have touched
common carnival fare!

331
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,450
I'm going to the buffet
for some hors d'oeuvres.

332
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,190
Well, no wonder
no pony wants my food.

333
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,730
They're filling up on all those
fancy-Schmancy vittles.

334
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,810
Well, my down-Home apples

335
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,110
Are plenty good enough
for this crowd.

336
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,410
I'll just dress them up a bit
and prove it to them.

337
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,110
I'll catch you yet,
my pretties. Oh, yes.

338
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,790
As soon as one of you little
birds or monkeys or bears

339
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,790
Touches this net,
you'll be mine.

340
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,150
Mine!

341
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,770
Wha--

342
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,130
come on, everypony!

343
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,150
You wanted a part-Ay?

344
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,330
Now let's party!

345
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,530
Yeah! Unh!

346
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,850
Now, that's a beat! Yeah!

347
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,450
Come on! Dance!

348
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,590
Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!

349
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,050
Okay,
all you high-Class ponies.

350
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,450
Here's a highfalutin
apple cake

351
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,130
For all your
hoity-Toity taste buds.

352
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,710
Stage dive!

353
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,430
Aah!
Aah!

354
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,710
You, sir, are the most
uncharming prince

355
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,990
I have ever met!

356
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,850
In fact, the only thing
royal about you

357
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,310
Is that you are
a royal pain!

358
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,110
Ew! Stay back!

359
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,890
I just
had myself groomed!

360
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,450
Afraid to get dirty?!

361
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,210
Aah! Aah!

362
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,490
Whoa!

363
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,490
Aah!

364
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,650
This is my chance!

365
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,150
Yes!

366
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,930
Whoa!

367
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,790
Well,
it can't get any worse.

368
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,890
You're going to love me!

369
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,570
Oh. Uh...

370
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,110
Run.

371
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,650
Ooh! Rarity,
your glass slipper!

372
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,670
Now your prince
is sure to find you!

373
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,230
Let's go!

374
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,070
Hey, Pony Joe,
another doughnut.

375
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,510
Don't you think
you've had enough?

376
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,270
Another doughnut!
Extra sprinkles!

377
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,070
Twilight Sparkle.

378
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,530
Long time, no see.

379
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,510
Hey, how was the gala?
How was your best night ever?

380
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,350
That sounds like
the worst night ever.

381
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,870
It was!
It was!
It was!
It was!

382
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,510
I just hope princess Celestia
isn't upset with us

383
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,690
For ruining the gala.

384
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,390
That was the best
Grand Galloping Gala ever!

385
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,370
Princess Celestia.

386
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,890
Pardon me, princess,
but tonight was just awful.

387
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,770
Oh, Twilight, the Grand
Galloping Gala is always awful.

388
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,870
It is?

389
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,310
That is why
I was thrilled

390
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,430
You were all attending.

391
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,810
I was hoping you could
liven things up a bit.

392
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,570
And while the evening may not
have gone as you planned,

393
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,570
I'm sure you'll agree
that in the end,

394
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,030
It didn't turn out so bad
for this group of friends.

395
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,490
You're right, princess.

396
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,090
Friends have a way of making
even the worst of times

397
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,850
Into something
pretty great.

398
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,570
Yeah!
Hanging out with friends.

399
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,870
Talking.

400
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,950
Laughing!

401
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,790
You mean doing exactly what
I wanted to do the whole time?

402
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,810
Yes, Spike.
You were right.

403
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,010
As horrible
as our night was...

404
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,790
being together here
has made it all better.

405
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,910
In fact, it's made it...

406
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,270
The best night ever!
