1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:06,535
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

2
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:09,085
You've really outdone yourselves,
Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

3
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:13,235
This is sure to be the winning entry
of this year's National Dessert Competition!

4
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:14,785
Oh, thank you Pinkie!

5
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:18,275
And thanks for transporting it
all the way to Canterlot for us.

6
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:20,455
Absolutely! It's my honor and I-

7
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:23,395
Beg pardon but,
could we maybe move things along?

8
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:26,315
This here cake's a mite heavy,
right Big Macintosh?

9
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,425
Eeyup.

10
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:30,245
All righty then, Big Mac!

11
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:34,175
To the train depot!

12
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:39,085
That's it Big Mac, nice and slow.

13
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:41,085
This is precious cargo you're carrying.

14
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:43,965
Yes, it took months
of planning and testing.

15
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:45,215
I would hate for it to-

16
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:49,085
Fall!

17
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:52,065
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

18
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:55,415
Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy,
a little pegassistance?

19
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:02,025
I'll get it there safely, you'll see!

20
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:04,975
Of course, Pinkie.

21
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,625
We never doubted you.

22
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:15,095
Twilight, can I see you a second?

23
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:19,435
A nice protective spell
as extra insurance...

24
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:20,685
Better safe than sorry.

25
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:27,655
AJ, Rarity, one last thing?

26
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:36,015
All right everypony,
we're in the home stretch here.

27
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:40,405
See, Mr. and Mrs. Cake?
I got it here without a hitch!

28
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,575
Now all we have to do is get it...

29
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:46,355
in?

30
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:55,415


31
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:01,135


32
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:23,425


33
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:35,325
Thank you all for helping me get
the cake safely on the dessert car.

34
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:38,095
Thank you for inviting us all
to go with you to Canterlot

35
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,985
for the National Dessert Competition.

36
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,745
I'm sure the festivities
will be just lovely.

37
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:45,015
Fooey on the festivities,
I can't wait to try

38
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,705
all those tasty treats!

39
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,985
Well, the tastiest treat
of all is sure to be the Cake's

40
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:54,105
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

41
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:57,735
All that rich creamy goodness
of the marzipan,

42
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:00,365
combined with the tart tanginess
of the mascarpone,

43
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:05,415
blended perfectly with the smooth,
silky sweetness of the meringue...

44
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:08,335
That's why I call the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

45
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:10,285
the "MMMM".

46
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:14,145
Exactly.

47
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,675
It's the most delicious delectable
delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria.

48
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:20,225
And it's sure to win first prize.

49
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,915
This is not so.

50
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:23,965
For I, Gustave Le Grand,

51
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:28,685
do challenge your crude cake
to a duel of delectable delacacies

52
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:33,565
against my exceptionally exquisite éclairs!

53
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:38,015
They will undoubtedly strike down
all the competition,

54
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,545
winning first prize and crowning me...

55
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:42,195
<i>le champion!</i>

56
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:43,975
Not a chance, Le Grand.

57
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:45,325
Doughnut Joe!

58
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,255
What are you doing in Ponyville?

59
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:51,905
Picking up the final all-important
ingredient for my contest entry...

60
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:54,805
"Doughnutopia"!

61
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,935
And with these super-sprinkles,

62
00:03:57,085 --> 00:04:01,585
my doughnuts are gonna dunk all
the other lousy desserts steal first prize,

63
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:03,985
and make my doughnut shop famous...

64
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,685
forever!

65
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:11,785
Oh, Joe... your dippy doughnuts
could never outrun me.

66
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:15,675
Hello. What's your name?

67
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:18,625
I am Mulia Mild.

68
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:22,355
Behold, my chocolate mousse moose.

69
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:26,315
It will trample all your treats,
be given first prize,

70
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:30,505
and make me the greatest chef
in Equestria...

71
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,725
Madame Mild, you and your
mousse moose are mistaken.

72
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,985
Your frou-frou éclairs
will never defeat my doughnuts!

73
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:41,525
The Cakes'
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

74
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:42,835
is going to win!

75
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:46,825
Your simple cake could never
take my moose.

76
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:57,295
Well, it sure looks like we're in
for a delicious competition tomorrow.

77
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,005
Maybe we should all settle in
for a good night's sleep.

78
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:13,075
I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.

79
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:15,705
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.

80
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,785
Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs?

81
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:20,865
We have to protect "MMMM".

82
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:22,415
Mmmm?

83
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:23,765
Mmm hmm.

84
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:27,355
I know for super sure that "MMMM"
is the best dessert in all of Equestria.

85
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,035
And I know that they know it too.

86
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,285
So...

87
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:33,965
So... one of them is going to
sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight!

88
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,845
You have to help me stand guard!

89
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,235
Pinkie, you're overreacting.

90
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,755
Yeah, those chefs aren't gonna
do your cake any harm.

91
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:43,195
But they are! I just know it.

92
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:45,815
Fine!
If you wanna stand guard, go for it.

93
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:47,365
We're going to bed.

94
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,425
I'll show them.

95
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:58,355
I'll stay up all night and protect you.

96
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:02,505
Nothing and nopony will stop me
from keeping you safe.

97
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:20,555
Stop, you saboteur!

98
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,005
I have you now!

99
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:55,625
Thank Celestia, you're okay!

100
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:58,585
But one of those bakers
is mixing up something bad.

101
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,275
So I'm not leaving you again,
no matter what.

102
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:05,475
Who turned out the moon?

103
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,985
Don't go near that cake, thief!

104
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:09,855
Stop, thief!

105
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,885
Oh, are you okay thief?

106
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,545
Overreacting my hoof.

107
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:26,005
I knew I was going to have
to keep a close eye on you.

108
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,575
And that's just what I'm gonna do.

109
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:43,425
The cake!

110
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,635
You look mmmm-marvelous.

111
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:57,875
I know. I think some congratulations
are in order for a job well done.

112
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:02,905
You better hold off on giving yourself
an award just yet Pinkie... look!

113
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:04,365
Look at what?!

114
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:16,025
What is it?

115
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:17,095
What happened?

116
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,245
It's the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

117
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,825
It's been... mutilated!

118
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:25,445
Now, we just need
to find out who done it.

119
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:28,345
You mean, who "did it".

120
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:30,195
Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.

121
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,755
Well, having read many mystery novels,

122
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:36,195
I know that the only way to
discover the culprit is to investigate.

123
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:37,345
Exactly.

124
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:44,955
And as chief detective,
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

125
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:48,575
- You're investigatin'?
- Yes!

126
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,755
And Twilight shall be
my lowly assistant

127
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,025
who asks silly questions
with obvious answers.

128
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:56,345
Fine, Pinkie.

129
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,555
Should we start looking for clues?

130
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,295
Perfect silly question,
my dear Twilight.

131
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:03,675
Because the obvious answer is...

132
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:05,375
Yes?

133
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,935
No! 'Cause I know who did it.

134
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:12,085
Pinkie, how could you possibly know?

135
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,115
How could I possibly not know?

136
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,875
Clearly, this dastardly deed
was done by the baker

137
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,845
who knew their dessert
could not measure up

138
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:22,665
to the mastery of the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness.

139
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:26,105
I guess you feared
your éclairs lacked flair...

140
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:28,065
Gustave!

141
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:05,095
Thus, destroying the cake,
and the Cakes' chance

142
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:07,485
of winning the
National Dessert Competition.

143
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:09,135
But it makes no sense!

144
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,055
What do you mean, lowly assistant?

145
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:13,425
Well first, if you were tied
to the train tracks,

146
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:14,865
how are you now here?

147
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,505
Guess that isn't
a totally silly question.

148
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:22,995
And second, the cake hasn't been sliced,
it's been bitten.

149
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:24,765
Just look at the teeth marks!

150
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:27,845
You're right, my fine fellow.

151
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,915
Gustave Le Grand
is clearly in the clear.

152
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:34,255
Which means the "MMMM"
was destroyed by another baker.

153
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:37,965
A baker whose doughnuts are do-nots.

154
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,885
That's right, it was Joe!

155
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:49,375
Or as he's known in the spy world,
Mane. Con Mane.

156
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:39,465
Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!

157
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:40,895
Pinkie!

158
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,535
There is no laser beam security system.

159
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,255
And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane!

160
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,195
He's big, gruff, and messy!

161
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:52,885
Although, you would look
rather dapper in a tuxedo.

162
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,795
You may be right, lowly assistant.

163
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:57,015
May be?

164
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,495
Now that I'm taking
a closer look at these desserts,

165
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:03,125
I see that one simply cannot
look me in the eye.

166
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,995
Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!

167
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,045
Yes!

168
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:11,685
And the mule behind the moose panicked
when she saw the mastery of the "MMMM".

169
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,455
So you're saying that the culprit is...

170
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:16,965
Mulia Mild!

171
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:47,275
Putting an end to the Cakes'
dreams of taking first prize.

172
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:51,075
I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia.

173
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:54,345
Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous!
Look at her!

174
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:58,605
I guess you're right...

175
00:12:58,755 --> 00:12:59,755
Thank you!

176
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,415
But I was so sure that it was
one of the other bitter bakers

177
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,165
that destroyed the "MMMM".

178
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:07,375
That way, their delicious dessert
would reign supreme.

179
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,305
I mean, just look at Joe's Doughnutopia.

180
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:13,895
It's a spectacular city
of doughnutty delight,

181
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:17,575
topped temptingly
in sprinklicious sprinkles.

182
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:22,835
And Gustave's éclairs look incredibly
edible, with glistening glaziness.

183
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:26,435
But then, there's
Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose.

184
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:30,775
Why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous
mousse moose tempts the taste buds

185
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:34,745
with this silky, smooth, yummy-nummy,
chocolateyness.

186
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:38,505
So, why did this criminal devour the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness

187
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,475
while leaving this trio
of tasty treats untouched?

188
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:55,505
Now I have no idea who do-doned it!

189
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:03,805
This mystery gets more mysterious
every minute.

190
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:07,475
Well, you have to stop the wild
accusations and get to the truth.

191
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,195
Everypony go back to your cars
while we do a little investigating.

192
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:16,515
Okay Pinkie, in order to
really solve this mystery,

193
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:19,095
we're going to have to find clues.

194
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:24,035
Now you were here,
at the scene of the crime all night.

195
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:26,475
You're not accusing me, are you?

196
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:27,875
No!

197
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:30,655
But maybe you saw something
that will help us.

198
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:33,195
I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!

199
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:36,115
Good... let's retrace your steps.

200
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:45,475
Then, I chased the culprit down
the train towards the caboose.

201
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:48,585
But when I got there, he was gone.

202
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:56,785
Our first clue.

203
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:04,045
I think I know who did it, Pinkie.

204
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,725
- Already?
- Yes.

205
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,995
But I need more evidence to confirm.

206
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:09,555
Tell me what happened next.

207
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:14,945
I heard somepony else in the dessert car,
and chased them up to the engine.

208
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:19,945
But, when I got there, all I saw
was the conductor shoveling coal.

209
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,855
The conductor, huh?

210
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,205
But, that doesn't make any sense.

211
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,085
What happened next, Pinkie?

212
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:40,005
Well... I went back to the dessert car.

213
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:52,575
Yes?

214
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:57,655
The curtains mysteriously closed,
all on their own.

215
00:15:57,805 --> 00:16:00,425
Interesting. Anything else?

216
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:03,085
I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud.

217
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,475
And then they were gone!

218
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,545
When I opened the curtains,
I saw that the portrait by the door

219
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:09,995
was all crooked.

220
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,665
Oh my, what is that?

221
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,415
What next, Pinkie?

222
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:26,235
That's it. I was here guarding
the cake the rest of the night.

223
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,095
I mean... I slept by the cake
the rest of the night.

224
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,545
And when you woke up,
half the cake was gone?

225
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:35,495
Exactly.

226
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:37,875
By Jove, I think I've got it.

227
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:39,825
Call everypony back.

228
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:41,925
We have a cake culprit to catch.

229
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:47,925
Why are we all here again?

230
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,405
I bet you're wondering
why you're all here again.

231
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,055
She's good.

232
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:57,015
We have discovered the true culprit
of this cake carnage.

233
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:58,795
But how?

234
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:01,565
Well you see, when committing a crime,

235
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:04,545
it's crucial that one
never leaves behind clues.

236
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:08,355
Especially an obvious clue like... this.

237
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:11,575
A blue feather.

238
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:15,485
I knew it was you, Gustave Le Grand.

239
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,655
Pinkie, Gustave doesn't
have blue feathers.

240
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,555
No, 'cause he's been dying them!

241
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,515
No, Pinkie.

242
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,595
Remember how when you chased
the suspect to the caboose,

243
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,045
they suddenly disappeared?

244
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:29,465
That's because they flew away.

245
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,325
But the thief did leave
a little something behind...

246
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:35,065
didn't you, Rainbow Dash?

247
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:37,495
I don't even like cake!

248
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:41,865
So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!

249
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:44,695
Case not solved, because
when we went to the engine,

250
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,045
I saw the conductor's hat.

251
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:49,815
And inside the hat was... this.

252
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:54,755
So it was you, that pink hair came
from your rainbow colored mane!

253
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,495
I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!

254
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,645
So you're wearing a wig?

255
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,655
Cut it out!

256
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:02,385
Pinkie, remember?

257
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:05,265
You chased a pony to the engine,
where you thought you saw

258
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:06,735
the conductor shoveling coal.

259
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,655
But that wasn't the conductor at all.

260
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,045
It was... Fluttershy.

261
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,995
You're going down, Fluttershy.

262
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:16,145
Pinkie!

263
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,895
But then another clue
confounded my suspicions.

264
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:23,775
You were guarding the cake
when the curtains mysteriously closed.

265
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,295
But that's no mystery, that's magic.

266
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:28,765
But when the thief tried
to make their great escape,

267
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:31,545
they left a little addition to the portrait.

268
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:36,545
Has anypony else noticed
that Rarity is wearing

269
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:38,365
her hair rather differently today?

270
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:42,885
What? Is it a crime to change
one's style every now and again?

271
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:45,025
Why, I think it's a crime not to.

272
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,595
Really?

273
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,255
Fine, I'm guilty!

274
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:53,155
I wear false eyelashes.

275
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:56,575
Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.

276
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,125
So did I.

277
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,505
Oh nuts, so did I.

278
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:02,585
You just made it sound
so delectable.

279
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:03,735
So tasty.

280
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:05,635
And boy was it!

281
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,985
I only meant to take a little,
lady-like bite.

282
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,435
And it was so good.

283
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:12,685
Yeah, I just dove right in!

284
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,865
But I'm really really sorry.

285
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,315
Terribly sorry.

286
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,315
Sorry, Pinkie.

287
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,025
That's okay.

288
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,415
At least this mystery
is finally solved.

289
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:24,465
But it isn't.

290
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:27,255
We figured out who ate the
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness,

291
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:30,515
but we still don't know who devoured
the other bakers' goods.

292
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:33,415
You're right, Twilight.
You know what we have to do?

293
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:36,755
Well, yes I do. Do you?

294
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,145
Look for clues!

295
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:52,315
Well, Pinkie. Did you find
the devourer of the desserts?

296
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:56,975
I most certainly did.
It was, none other than...

297
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,955
the bakers!

298
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:05,315
First of all, Gustave has mousse
in his moustache.

299
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:09,955
And Joe has éclair in his hair.

300
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:16,455
And Mulia has sprinkles
in her freckles!

301
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:19,645
What do you say, bakers?

302
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:22,045
Oh I am so sorry, Mulia.

303
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:25,665
But Pinkie made your
mousse moose sound...

304
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:27,215
<i>très magnifique.</i>

305
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:32,015
And Pinkie's description of your éclairs
really did make 'em sound scrumptious.

306
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:35,715
And the way she spoke
of your Doughnutopia,

307
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:38,725
it was too delectable to resist.

308
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:46,155
Well everypony,
we finally have the mystery solved.

309
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:50,345
Yes, but now we don't have any desserts
to enter into the contest!

310
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:53,885
I think we can fix that. Come on!

311
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:58,055
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

312
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:01,695
<i>today I learned that it's not good
to jump to conclusions.</i>

313
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:05,365
<i>You have to find out all the facts
before saying somepony did something.</i>

314
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:09,695
<i>If you don't, you could end up blaming
somepony for something they never did.</i>

315
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:14,835
<i>This could hurt their feelings,
and it can make you look really foolish.</i>

316
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:19,015
<i>So from now on, I'll always
make sure to get all the facts.</i>

317
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:22,195
How's that for a lesson,
Princess Celestia?

318
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,235
Care for a bite?

319
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:29,105
I don't mind if I do.
