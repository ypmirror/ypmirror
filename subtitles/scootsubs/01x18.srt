1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,750
Where
are you taking us?

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,450
We're almost there, youngins!

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,220
I've never been here
before.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,560
Ouch!

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,010
Oh, sorry.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,510
Are we there yet?

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,300
There? Where?
What?

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,090
I don't even know
what we're doing!

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,390
Here we are!

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,830
What are we
looking at?

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,860
I have no idea.

12
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,130
What is
that thing?

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,760
Cutie Mark Crusaders,
welcome to your new clubhouse!

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,570
Well, don't thank me
all at once.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,500
This was my clubhouse
when I was your age.

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,450
Sure, it hasn't been used
in a while,

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,630
But it's empty

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,900
And on a secluded, private
part of the farm.

19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,330
And it's all yours.

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,300
It just needs
a little, uh, TLC.

21
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,890
TLC as in "Tender Loving Care"
or "Totally Lost Cause"?

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,710
Applejack,
we're supposed to turn this

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,530
Into
our new clubhouse?

24
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,740
Well, maybe y'all will get
your cutie marks

25
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,220
When you discover
your talent for -- Aah!

26
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,240
Ugh.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,430
House cleaning?

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,270
Regular subtitles

29
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,050
Not so fast!

30
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,450
Whoa!
Hey, Scootaloo.

31
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,430
Back already?

32
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,360
You're amazing
on that scooter.

33
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,870
Thanks.
Wow, Apple Bloom.

34
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,080
You did all of this?
Yep.

35
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,930
I fixed the broken shutters,
sanded off the splinters,

36
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,800
Rebuilt the roof, painted.

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,610
That's so cool!

38
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,000
What's Sweetie Belle
up to?

39
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,770
* we are
the Cutie Mark Crusaders *

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,940
* never stop the journey

41
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,030
There you are, Sweetie Belle!

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,470
See?
I told you we could find her

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,750
By following
her totally awesome voice.

44
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,740
What's that sweet tune
you're singing?

45
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,890
Oh. I was just working on our
new Cutie Mark Crusaders
theme song.

46
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,570
Cool!
Cool!

47
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,790
Teach us?

48
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,590
Well, I've only come up
with one part, but, okay!

49
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,730
* they all say
that you will get your mark *

50
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,700
* when the time
is really right *

51
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,990
* and you know just
what you're supposed to do *

52
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,020
* and your talent
comes to light! *

53
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,410
Well, I'll be,
Cutie Mark Crusaders.

54
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,690
You've done one fine job
with this place.

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,080
So, what's next?

56
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,890
Well, now that we have
a real-Life clubhouse...

57
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,700
and a map
of Ponyville...

58
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,210
and a Cutie Mark Crusaders
theme song...

59
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,150
theme song?

60
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,530
We're gonna go out in the world

61
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,940
And discover our talents!

62
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,490
A new adventure!

63
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,320
And earn
our cutie marks!

64
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,000
We'll leave no stone unturned!

65
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,070
No mountain unclimbed!

66
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,800
No meal uncooked!

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,380
No song unlearned!

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,590
Well, okay, then!

69
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,060
sounds like you have a plan.

70
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,790
I got to, uh,
leave no apple unpicked.

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,190
See y'all later.

72
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,590
Are we ready to get
our cutie marks, ponies?

73
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,540
Ready!
Ready!

74
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,450
I had nothing to do
with this.

75
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,840
What is going on here?

76
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:24,810
Hmm.

77
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,820
Well, we sure aren't getting
our cutie marks

78
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,110
For being librarians.

79
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,850
Huh.
I should think not.

80
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,120
What?

81
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,050
Girls, I think you're going
about this the wrong way.

82
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,300
Instead of trying to do things

83
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,790
In areas
you're not familiar with,

84
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,190
Why not try doing things
in areas that you already like?

85
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,090
And I have the perfect place
to start.

86
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,670
Showcase your talents...

87
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,720
for all to see.

88
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,780
Perform in the Ponyville
school talent show!

89
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,840
There will be
all sorts of awards --

90
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,250
Best dramatic performance,
best comedy act, best magic act.

91
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,390
Surely you can find
your talent.

92
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,560
This would be the perfect place
to discover our talents!

93
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,360
Juggling!

94
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,080
Acting!

95
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,300
Magic tricks!

96
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,420
Square dancing!

97
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,650
Tight-Rope walking!

98
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,730
Tiger taming!

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,520
My little ponies,
you're missing the point.

100
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,450
Think about the things
you already enjoy doing.

101
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,560
Think about
what you're already good at.

102
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,360
Sure.
We could do that.

103
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,830
Yeah, sure we can.

104
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,610
Well, whatever we do,
we'll do it as...

105
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,410
the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

106
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,610
Sweetie Belle!

107
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,280
I told you not to touch
my things!

108
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,520
Come back
with my supplies!

109
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,820
We're just borrowing them
for the talent show.

110
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,370
Don't worry, sis!

111
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,290
I promise
we'll bring them back!

112
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,750
Thanks, mr. Breezy.

113
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,980
We're return the fan to you
real soon.

114
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,030
What do we need
this fan for?

115
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,560
Trust me on this one.

116
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,290
Okay, so that's six wooden
planks, 4x8 plywood,

117
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,180
A box of nails, four cans
of paint, and four brushes.

118
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,110
Anything else?

119
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,540
Yeah.

120
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,450
Instructions on how to use
six wooden planks,

121
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,300
4x8 plywood, a box of nails,
four cans of paint,

122
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,290
And four brushes.

123
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,750
Whoa!

124
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,400
"Ghosts, goblins,
and ghoulish figures"?

125
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,870
Good heavens, girls.

126
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,660
What do you need
a book like this for?

127
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,750
You'll see.
Thanks, Twilight.

128
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,050
We'll give it back as soon
as we're done with it!

129
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,860
What do you think
they're up to?

130
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,090
I have no idea,

131
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,980
And I don't know if I should be
excited or scared to find out.

132
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,290
I'm glad
we're doing this as a team.

133
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,580
Me too!

134
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,170
Um, so,
what are we doing again?

135
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,040
A super, awesome, dramatic song
for the talent show, of course.

136
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:41,740
Right!

137
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,310
With super-Cool scenery
and amazing costumes!

138
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,580
And mind-Blowing
dance moves.

139
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,060
This is gonna be
so amazing.

140
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,740
Sweetie Belle, I think
you should be the singer.

141
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,500
What?

142
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,790
No way I'm singing
in front of a crowd.

143
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,360
Twilight said to do something
we like to do,

144
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,950
And I'd like to be
like my big sister,

145
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,540
And she's a designer.

146
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,330
Fine, then. You can do
the costumes and the scenery.

147
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:05,900
Mm-Hmm.

148
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,660
And, Scootaloo, you're great
at maneuvers on your scooter,

149
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,390
So you should do
the choreography.

150
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,630
You know,
all those dance moves.

151
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,620
Nah.

152
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,790
I'd rather sing
a wicked rock ballad.

153
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,150
Why don't you come up with the
dance routine, Apple Bloom?

154
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,630
Hmm.

155
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,980
I'm not much of a dancer,
but I do like kung fu!

156
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,470
That's kind of like dancing!

157
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
Hyah! Hah!

158
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,610
Hah! Yah!

159
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,010
Then it's settled!

160
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,740
Let's get started!

161
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,840
One, two, three, oh!

162
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,690
Oh!

163
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,460
Ow, Apple Bloom!

164
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,700
What are you doing?

165
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,990
I feel like I have
four left feet.

166
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,350
I can't even spin right.

167
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,720
Don't be silly.

168
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,230
You just got to keep
your head forward

169
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,280
Until the very last minute,
like this.

170
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,630
See?
Easy peasy.

171
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,710
You just got to practice
a bunch, that's all.

172
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,630
Wow!

173
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,020
That does look easy!
Thanks!

174
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,780
Okay.
Let's try this again.

175
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,940
Oh! Ouch!

176
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,780
Ow!

177
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm okay!

178
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,610
Keep practicing!

179
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,060
Will do!

180
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,500
 * we fight the fight,
walk the walk *

181
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,470
* talk the talk, eat the, uh,
food like a celery stalk? *

182
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,340
Ugh!

183
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,890
I'll never come up
with anything!

184
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,900
Never, never, never!

185
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,320
Come back! Come back!

186
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,990
Dumb fabric.

187
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,670
Hey, scoot.
How's the song going?

188
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,250
Pbht!

189
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,680
Pbht?
Oh, my.

190
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,910
Sounds serious.

191
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,040
I'm just no good
at lyrics.

192
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,100
Coming up with words
is like...really hard.

193
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,100
Oh,
they can't be that bad.

194
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,010
"With our cutie marks
we'll rock Equestria.

195
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,340
We use our stomachs
to digestia"?

196
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,710
Um, well,
these are, um, good,

197
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,900
But how about
after "we fight the fight"...

198
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,690
* there is nothing
that we fear *

199
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,490
* we'll have to figure out
what we'll do next *

200
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,580
* till our cutie marks
are here *

201
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,430
Wow!
That's so awesome!

202
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,290
Did you just come up
with that now?

203
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,270
Yeah, kind of.

204
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,120
Thanks!

205
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,820
I'm totally using that.

206
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,290
Oh, no!

207
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,120
One, two, three, four, five?

208
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,110
Oh!

209
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,370
Ouch!

210
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,600
How's the spin
coming along?

211
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,220
I think I got to just stick
to punches and kicks.

212
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,200
You know
ponies only have four legs?

213
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Unh.

214
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,720
I'll never be a designer
like my sister, Rarity.

215
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,490
Hey,
it's no big deal.

216
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,070
Why don't you use
the dress form?

217
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,600
It'll help you
with your patterns

218
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,900
And help you put all the pieces
in the right places.

219
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,690
Oh.
Is that what that's for?

220
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,740
Uh, maybe you should also clean
your paint brush

221
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,970
Between each color.

222
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,590
Oh, I was wondering why all
the colors looked like mud.

223
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,700
You're not using power tools,
are you?

224
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,750
The talent show's
just around the corner.

225
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,440
I wonder how the fillies
are doing.

226
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,300
Oh, sorry, Scootaloo!

227
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,660
That's okay.
Ugh!

228
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,340
Oops!
Sorry, Scootaloo.

229
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,020
Ouch!

230
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,760
Oh, my bad,
Sweetie Belle.

231
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,810
Let's sing
the chorus again.

232
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,450
Well, gosh.

233
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,370
Sure wasn't expecting that.

234
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,510
I think that sounded pretty good.

235
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,890
Me too.
You think we're ready?

236
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,740
Ready as we'll ever be.

237
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,350
Hey,
did you see us practicing?

238
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,190
Uh, yeah.

239
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,420
Well, how did we do?
How did we do?

240
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,130
Uh...

241
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,160
speechless!
See, girls?

242
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,820
I told you that's what
we're gonna do.

243
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,030
We're gonna leave them
speechless!

244
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,810
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!

245
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,630
Speechless is right.

246
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,340
And on the count
of three,

247
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,170
This rabbit
will disappear

248
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,880
And something tasty
will reappear in its place!

249
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,050
One, a-Two,
and a-Three!

250
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,110
Hey!
Where are they?

251
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,580
Snails,
where are the...

252
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,270
...carrots.

253
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,520
Snails!

254
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,100
Uh, how about a round of
applause for the S&S magic act?

255
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,920
And now for our next act,

256
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,670
We have Sunny Days
and Peachy Pie

257
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,140
Reciting their favorite poem
on roller skates!

258
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,210
Break a leg!

259
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,880
Sweetie Belle,
what a thing to say!

260
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,760
No, no, no.
You see, in the theater,

261
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,070
It's considered bad luck
to say "good luck,"

262
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,050
So you say
"break a leg" instead.

263
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,710
My little ponies,
how are you doing?

264
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,670
Nervous.
Nervous.
Nervous.

265
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,780
Don't worry.
You're gonna be amazing.

266
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,000
Remember -- Just stick
to what you know best.

267
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,450
I can't wait to hear you sing,
Sweetie Belle.

268
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,780
What does every pony
always think I'm gonna sing?

269
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,410
Actually, Twilight Sparkle,
I'm the main singer tonight.

270
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,570
Oh?

271
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,200
And I'm the main dancer.

272
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,650
Hyah!

273
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,690
Oh?

274
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,140
And I'm in charge of...

275
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,500
costumes?

276
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,200
And sets and props.

277
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,310
How'd you know?

278
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,330
Really, girls?
Are you sure?

279
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,670
Cutie Mark Crusaders,
you're on next.

280
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,490
Break a leg.

281
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,080
Break a le--
Ugh!

282
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,650
Uh, good luck!

283
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,350
* look here
are three little ponies *

284
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,840
* ready to sing
for this crowd *

285
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,480
* listen up
'cause here's our story *

286
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,960
* I'm gonna sing it very loud

287
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,020
* when you're
a younger pony *

288
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,700
* and your flank
is very bare *

289
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,790
* feels like the sun
will never come *

290
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,870
* when your cutie mark's
not there *

291
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,110
* so the three of us
fight the fight *

292
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,060
* there is nothing
that we fear *

293
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,270
* we'll have to figure out
what we'll do next *

294
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,110
* till our cutie marks
are here *

295
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,440
* we are
the Cutie Mark Crusaders *

296
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,580
* on a quest to find out
who we are *

297
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,410
* and we will never stop
the journey *

298
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
* not until we have
our cutie marks *

299
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,940
* they all say
that you'll get your mark *

300
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,680
* when the time
is really right *

301
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,740
* and you know just what
you're supposed to do *

302
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,690
* and your talent
comes to light *

303
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,620
* but it's not as easy
as it sounds *

304
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,730
* and that waiting's
hard to do *

305
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,260
* so we test our talents
everywhere *

306
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,940
* until our face is blue

307
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,070
* we are
the Cutie Mark Crusaders *

308
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,480
* on a quest to find out
who we are *

309
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,550
* and we will never stop
the journey *

310
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,790
* not until we have
our cutie marks *

311
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,640
* we are
the Cutie Mark Crusaders *

312
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,810
* on a quest to find out
who we are *

313
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,890
* and we will never stop
the journey *

314
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,330
* not until we have
our cutie marks *

315
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,710
Wow.

316
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,350
That did not go
as well as I expected.

317
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,890
I can't believe
they're laughing at us!

318
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,050
Was it that bad?

319
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,670
Back on stage, girls!
It's time for the awards!

320
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,930
Back on stage?
No.

321
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,180
They'll just laugh
some more!

322
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,240
Yeah.
What's the point?

323
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,660
Now, girls,
let's be good sports.

324
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,150
You made a great effort.

325
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,590
You should be proud.
Now, come on.

326
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,780
Let's hear it for all our
talented fillies and colts.

327
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,650
Our first award goes to...

328
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,970
Snip and Snails
for best magic act.

329
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,600
Hey!
My medal is shinier!

330
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,510
Well, mine's bigger!

331
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,060
Oh, yeah, well --
Well, mine, is, um, heavier?

332
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,130
The next award goes to
Sunny Days and Peachy Pie

333
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,810
For best dramatic performance.

334
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,760
And, finally, the last award
of the night goes to...

335
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,560
...the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

336
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,720
What?
What?
What?

337
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,130
For best comedy act!

338
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,410
Can you believe it?
We won!

339
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,590
I knew our act
was awesome!

340
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,530
You know
what would be the best?

341
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,340
If we won
and we got our cutie marks.

342
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,290
Congratulations, ponies.

343
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,780
Job well done.

344
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,100
Thanks, Twilight.

345
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,730
Hey.
You don't sound too excited.

346
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,350
We worked really hard
and won a prize,

347
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,820
But we still don't have
our cutie marks.

348
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,730
Which is the prize
we really wanted.

349
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,870
Oh, girls.

350
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,560
But we think
we know why.

351
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,310
Yes.
We know why.

352
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,070
Oh?
Tell me.

353
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,820
I'd love to make a special
report to the princess.

354
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,850
Well, maybe we were trying
too hard.

355
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,710
Yes?
And?

356
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,630
And instead of forcing ourselves

357
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,710
To do something
that's not meant for us...

358
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,530
yes? Yes?

359
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,530
We each should be embracing
our true talent.

360
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,260
And that is?

361
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,450
Comedy!
Comedy!
Comedy!

362
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,940
Apple Bloom,
you did it!

363
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,850
Did you see our award?

364
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,240
Weren't we funny?

365
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,210
One day.

366
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,650
One day.
