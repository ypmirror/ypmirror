1
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:06,345
No distractions.

2
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:10,825
Today is too important.

3
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:14,305
Reshelving day!

4
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:26,445
"Understanding Medieval Equestria"
goes in... Pony History.

5
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,485
"Modern Spellcasting" –
that's Classics.

6
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:34,615
"The Art of the To-Do List". Actually,
I kinda wanna read that again.

7
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:40,555
Spike! What are you laughing at?

8
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,795
This little beauty. It's my
birthday present to myself.

9
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:46,265
It's a fire ruby.

10
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:50,505
I've been aging it for months.
And it's almost ripe!

11
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:03,705
Hey! You took my advice!

12
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:06,545
Just use the whole
floor as one big shelf.

13
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:50,415
Hello! Anypony home? Twilight!

14
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:54,285
Is that a fire ruby?

15
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:57,515
That must be at least twenty carats!

16
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:59,855
No inclusions, pristine facets...

17
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:01,545
And totally delicious.

18
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,515
Uh, you guys don't mind?

19
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:05,825
Oh! Uh, of course.

20
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:09,545
I just came by to see if you hadn't
any books on historical fashion.

21
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,855
Did you say "delicious"?

22
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:16,545
Sure did! Next week's my birthday.
And this is my birthday dinner.

23
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:19,595
Start with this one.

24
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:21,555
Thanks, Twilight.

25
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,055
I've got the feeling
ruffled taffeta capes...

26
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,255
...are going to make a huge
comeback this season.

27
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:27,575
And I want to be ahead of the game.

28
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:32,475
I hope it's as tasty
as it is beautiful, Spike.

29
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:36,455
I've never seen anything
quite so stunning before.

30
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,855
Gosh. You really like it, huh?

31
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:44,215
Like it?

32
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:47,545
It's magnificent!

33
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:54,715
Then you should have it.

34
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:58,055
This beautiful gem was
meant to to be with you.

35
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,465
I don't know what to say.

36
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:04,805
This is so thoughtful.

37
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:07,385
Mm, my little Spikey-wikey!

38
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:14,005
Thank you so much!

39
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,495
Wow, Spike.

40
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,655
That's one of the kindest, most
generous things you've ever done.

41
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:21,365
I've never seen Rarity so happy.

42
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:24,785
I will never wash this cheek again.

43
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:38,315
Just about finished, Spike?

44
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:39,885
Everypony will be here soon.

45
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,305
There. Perfect.

46
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,125
Everything looks perfect.

47
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:46,225
Not quite everything.

48
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:49,355
A wash cloth? I don't get it.

49
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,825
Oh, no way, Twilight!

50
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:57,415
I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek
that Rarity kissed and I meant it!

51
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,315
It's over, Spike!
I'm cleaning that cheek!

52
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:10,395
It's mine!

53
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:12,995
-Stop it!
-Never!

54
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:20,725
Happy birthday!

55
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:26,755
Party time, woohoo!

56
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:29,095
Are those... for me?

57
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,525
You bet they are, birthday boy.

58
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:33,645
Happy birthday, Spike.

59
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,445
Don't you know you get
presents on your birthday?

60
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:49,555
Well, actually this is my first
birthday in Ponyville.

61
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,035
I usually just get one present.

62
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,845
From Twilight. A book.

63
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,005
Speaking of presents, this is
from my new line of taffeta capes.

64
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:05,455
I'm going to make one for each of you.

65
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:11,605
I've been inspired by the generosity
of my little Spikey-wikey...

66
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,105
...who gave me this
beautiful fire ruby...

67
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,755
...one of the kindest acts
I've ever experienced.

68
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:28,335
Applejack, I can't thank you
enough for this great blanket.

69
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,325
I really needed a new one.

70
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:33,635
Come on, Spike. You already
thanked me fifteen times.

71
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:35,735
I'm starting to get a little embarrassed.

72
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,585
I know I keep thanking you guys,
but I'm just so grateful.

73
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:41,475
I wish this party could last forever.

74
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:42,965
Duh!

75
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:45,945
Party can't last forever, cause
you have to go to Sugarcube Corner...

76
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:48,435
...cause the Cakes said they have
a special surprise for you...

77
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,035
...CAUSE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!

78
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:51,775
NO WAY!

79
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,395
I said the party can't last forever...

80
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,875
...but it doesn't need to end right now!

81
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,525
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cake!

82
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:05,285
There's the dragon of the hour!
Happy birthday, Spike!

83
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:06,275
Thanks.

84
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,245
When we found out
it was your birthday...

85
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:11,075
...we couldn't resist
trying out a new recipe.

86
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,735
Sapphire!

87
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:15,855
Wow!

88
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:19,205
Thank you so much!

89
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:23,525
Man! First I get a bunch of great
presents from my best friends...

90
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:26,085
...and now an amazing sapphire cupcake!

91
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,695
Ho ho, what a day!

92
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:39,765
Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee.

93
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:43,265
That's okay. What's got you so excited?

94
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:50,145
Pinkie Pie told me I should
come to the Cakes...

95
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:52,555
...so they could give me a treat,
cause it's my birthday today.

96
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:54,395
Why, happy birthday, Spike!

97
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:56,365
I wish I had something to give you.

98
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:58,225
Oh!

99
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:01,825
Here you go.

100
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,345
Wow. Really?

101
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:06,595
Sure. Everypony should get
fun gifts on their birthday.

102
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:11,465
Have a great birthday, Spike.

103
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:14,245
I wish every day was my birthday.

104
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,395
Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday
to the Cakes and I get a cupcake.

105
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:23,275
I mention it to Cheerilee
and I get this great hat.

106
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:36,335
I wonder...

107
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:39,825
Hey there, Lickety Split! That's
a pretty cool ball you got there!

108
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:42,245
Did you know it's my birthday?

109
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,705
This in unbelievable!

110
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:55,425
Hey, Junebug! It's my birthday!

111
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,275
Uh... Happy birthday, Spike.

112
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:01,475
Aren't you gonna give me something?

113
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,355
You know, like a birthday present?

114
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,325
Um... I... I don't have anything.

115
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,415
Well, how about those
flowers? I'll take those.

116
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:09,725
Spike!

117
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,135
Sorry, Junebug.

118
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:16,075
I think Spike might have
gotten a little carried away.

119
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,105
Uh... No problem.

120
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:19,975
Happy birthday, Spike!

121
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:24,045
What are you doing? You're
out here demanding gifts now?

122
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:28,035
Wow. You're right, Twilight.

123
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,645
I don't know what got into me.

124
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,405
Thanks for snapping me out of it.

125
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,505
I'd better go give
Cheerilee her hat back.

126
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:38,135
No problem. See you at home later?

127
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:40,485
Sounds good. Bye!

128
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:49,035
Who else has a present for Spikey-wikey?

129
00:08:57,535 --> 00:09:00,385
Wow. Little rough night sleep, Spike.

130
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:02,535
I had the weirdest drea...

131
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:09,865
I can't believe you!
Where'd you get all this...?

132
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:17,795
What happened?

133
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:25,245
What's happening to me, Twilight?!

134
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,805
I don't know! Think back to last night.

135
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:29,485
Did something happen?

136
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,035
Spike.

137
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,105
What did you do after I saw you?

138
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:44,195
I went to talk to...

139
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:46,635
Spike!

140
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:51,445
You went to talk to who?

141
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:54,015
Oh, um... I don't remember.

142
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:56,555
Hey, can I have that globe?
You're not using it, right?

143
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,595
Huh?

144
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:02,595
What about this book?

145
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,105
Spike, I'm worried about you.

146
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,965
You're usually not so... grabby.

147
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:15,105
My arms aren't usually
THIS LONG EITHER.

148
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:20,645
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

149
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,205
Well now, what theems to be the problem?

150
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,815
This is Spike...

151
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,345
...and something's wrong with him.

152
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:37,115
He used to be half this size.

153
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:40,275
And he keeps trying to take
things that aren't... his.

154
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:44,635
All right then. Let'th just
have a look-thee, shall we?

155
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:48,205
Wittle guy not feewing too good?

156
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:53,145
Who's the brave wittle boy, huh?
Who's the brave one?

157
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:59,175
So? What do you think, doctor?

158
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:02,875
Well, I think I know
what the problem is.

159
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,455
He is... a dragon!

160
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:08,855
That's not the problem.
He's always been a dragon.

161
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,845
Oh. Well, that would explain it.

162
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:13,265
Listen, I don't know
anything about dragons.

163
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:16,635
I know about baby ponies.
Maybe you should try a vet.

164
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,625
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

165
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:23,465
Well, I'm flummoxed.

166
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,665
You bring me a dog – I've
got it diagnosed in seconds.

167
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,875
Snake even faster. But to be honest...

168
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,565
...I've never seen
a real-life dragon before.

169
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:35,845
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

170
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,455
Set.

171
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:44,115
Thanks anyway.

172
00:11:44,115 --> 00:11:46,015
Come on, Spike.

173
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:00,345
Ooh.

174
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,035
He is starting to mature.

175
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,285
Of this fact I am quite sure.

176
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:07,485
Mature? So he's just... growing up?

177
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:10,585
But that doesn't explain
why he keeps grabbing things.

178
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,875
A dragon's heart is prone to greed.

179
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:16,735
A steady diet to make growth speed.

180
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:21,105
Then the resulting bigger size
only makes their hunger rise.

181
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:24,835
If this trait should go unchecked,
if Spike continues to collect...

182
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,455
...more growth will certainly occur.

183
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,025
He is going to turn into a monster.

184
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:31,775
You mean...

185
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:35,375
...the more things the dragon collects,
the bigger and greedier he gets?

186
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:38,475
But how do we stop him before
he's completely out of control?

187
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:41,315
If his monstrous ways
you wish to impede...

188
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:44,715
...you must prevent him
from practicing greed.

189
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:55,535
Get away from her, you brute!

190
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,545
SPIKE WANT!

191
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,235
You're not getting my scooter!

192
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,765
SPIKE WANT!

193
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:06,835
Hey, Spike!

194
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:09,625
Check out this amazing broom.

195
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:15,515
SPIKE WAAANT!!!

196
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:25,845
Come on, big boy.
Look at this incredible broom.

197
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:34,105
SPIKE WANT!

198
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,895
Fight all you want.
I'm not letting you out.

199
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,345
Ugh, Spike.
I just reshelved this room.

200
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,195
What now?

201
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,925
Now who in Ponyville
would steal my apples?

202
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,415
For that matter, who
would steal my leaves?

203
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:13,505
Applejack, help!

204
00:14:13,505 --> 00:14:15,985
Spike's running wild and
I need you to lasso him!

205
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,945
Oh, that's a good one, Twilight.

206
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,235
Sweet little Spike running wild.

207
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:24,605
What a laugh.

208
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:30,395
Twilight, get my rope.

209
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,875
HEEELP!

210
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:47,775
Huh?

211
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:56,245
Don't tell me you...
you tied yourselves up?

212
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:57,995
Get us out of here right now!

213
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:01,345
What was that?

214
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:03,785
Sounded like Fluttershy to me.

215
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,325
Fluttershy? Fluttershy!

216
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,525
I'm up here!

217
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,995
What happened?

218
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:14,375
I was helping my squirrel friends
with their dance step...

219
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:20,145
...and all of a sudden a giant
rampaging d-d-dragon stormed through.

220
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:21,765
That was Spike!

221
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:25,965
Spike?! But why would Spike
steal my chicken coop?

222
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,365
He just pulled it out of the ground...

223
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,795
...and filled it with a bunch
of apples and stuff...

224
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,205
That sounded like Pinkie Pie!

225
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:34,685
Come on, girls!

226
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:36,905
Back! Get back!

227
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:46,215
Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!

228
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:49,265
I'm not giving him cake!
I'm assaulting him with cake!

229
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,795
How dare you take the cake?!

230
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:09,455
He's completely out of control.
Who knows where he'll go next?

231
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,895
Perhaps some more ruffle.

232
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:50,905
Put me down, you brute!

233
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:57,125
How rude.

234
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,655
Don't worry, Rarity. We'll save you.

235
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:02,215
Put her down right now!

236
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:04,675
I-If you wouldn't mind, that is.

237
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:07,265
I mean it, dragon boy!

238
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:10,665
We'd be ever so grateful if you'd be
so kind as to possibly consider...

239
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,925
Drop her, scaly!

240
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:14,445
Hey!

241
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:19,195
I'm... not some...
sort of common... flyswattaaah!

242
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:27,735
Girls!

243
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:29,445
My cape!

244
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,485
Look! The Wonderbolts!

245
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:23,465
Oh, be quiet.

246
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:25,795
You've got nothing to be proud of.

247
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:28,255
You steal everypony's things,
terrorize the town...

248
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:30,845
...and use me as a weapon
against my own friends.

249
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,415
Which as horrible as it is,
I can almost understand...

250
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:35,235
...because you're a dragon and all.

251
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:36,685
BUT THIS...

252
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:41,835
THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST FASHION!

253
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:53,045
Oh no! You are not
getting this gemstone!

254
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,005
This was given to me
by my dear friend Spikey-wikey.

255
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:01,645
The kindest, sweetest,
most generous dragon ever.

256
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:05,965
And it is too precious to me to give
to a greedy old beast like you!

257
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,155
"Here, Rarity. You take it."

258
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:19,745
"It would mean even more to see
you happy, than to eat it myself."

259
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:22,815
"I... I don't know what to say..."

260
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:25,385
"This is just so generous..."

261
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:37,585
Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be
eating me or something.

262
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:43,655
Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?!

263
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,305
Somepony do something!

264
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:49,675
On it!

265
00:19:56,645 --> 00:20:00,985
Rarity, I need to tell you something.
Just in case we don't make it.

266
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:04,995
I've always sort of had a crush...

267
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:23,615
We did it! I can't believe we did it!

268
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:32,885
All in a day's work.

269
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:44,205
Spike, I just have to tell you how
absolutely proud I am of you.

270
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,625
Proud of me?

271
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:52,405
Yes. It was you, who stopped...
you from destroying Ponyville.

272
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:55,365
You are my hero, Spikey-wikey.

273
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,375
"Dear Princess Celestia."

274
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,125
"Today I learned a great
lesson about friendship."

275
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:11,555
"Well, you might think that it would feel
good to get lots and lots of stuff..."

276
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:14,445
"...but it doesn't feel nearly as great
as giving something special..."

277
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,775
"...to somepony you really care about."

278
00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:20,525
"Why, I learned that it truly
is better to give than to receive..."

279
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:23,865
"...and that kindness and generosity
are what lead to true friendship."

280
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:28,245
"And that's more valuable
than anything in the world."

281
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,945
Well, almost anything.

282
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:36,855
