the magical land of Equestria,

There were two regal sisters
who ruled together

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,170
And created harmony
for all the land.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,810
To do this, the eldest
used her unicorn powers

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,640
To raise the sun at dawn.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,080
The younger brought out the moon
to begin the night.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,780
Thus, the two sisters
maintained balance

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,810

and their subjects --

of ponies.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,690

sister became resentful.

her elder sister brought forth

13

through her beautiful night.

One fateful day,
the younger unicorn

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,850
Refused to lower the moon
to make way for the dawn.

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,510
The elder sister
tried to reason with her,

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,200
But the bitterness
in the young one's heart

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,170
Had transformed her into
a wicked mare of darkness --

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,530

the land in eternal night.

magic known to ponydom --

27

And banished her permanently
on the moon.
