1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,640
Wow.
What a gorgeous day.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,090
Rainbow Dash must have
gotten up early for once

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,300
And cleared
all the clouds away.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,060
I bet all of Ponyville

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,160
Is gonna be out
enjoying the sunshine.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,620
What?
Where is everypony?

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,120
Is it some sort
of pony holiday?

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,420
Not that I know of.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,750
Does my breath stink?

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,130
Not more than usual.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,450
Is it...zombies?!

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,360
Uh, not very likely.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,300
Not likely,
but possible?

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,410
psst!

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,890
Twilight!

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,190
Spike!
Come here!

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,540
Come here!

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,230
Hurry!
Before she gets you!

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,170
Who?
The zombie pony?

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,550
Z-Zombie pony?

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,850
Aah!

22
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,180
Spike, there are no
zombie ponies.

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,890
Pinkie, what are you doing
here alone in the dark?

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,570
I'm not alone
in the dark.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,490
Okay, then, what are you all
doing here in the dark?

26
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,060
We're hiding from her.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,600

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,330
Did you see her,
Twilight?

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,990
Did you see...Zecora?

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,580
Apple Bloom, I told you
never to say that name.

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,030
Well, I saw her
glance this way.

32
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,780
Glance e-E-Evilly
this way.

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,590
And then a bunch of you flip out
for no good reason.

34
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,450
No good reason?!

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,900
You call protecting your kin
no good reason?

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,320
Why, as soon as my sister
saw Zecora riding into town,

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,930
She started shaking
in her little horseshoes.

38
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,520
Did not.

39
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,550
So I swept her up
and brought her here.

40
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,650
I walked here myself.

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,860
For safekeeping.

42
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,260
Applejack,
I'm not a baby!

43
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,960
I can take care
of myself!

44
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,250
Not from
that creepy Zecora.

45
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,270
She's mysterious...

46
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,530
sinister...

47
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,230
and spo-o-o-oky.

48
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,650
Will you
cut that out?

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,890
Just look at those stripes.
So garish.

50
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,820
She's a zebra.

51
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,360
A what?!
A what?!
A what?!
A what?!

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,630
A zebra.

53
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,160
And her stripes aren't
a fashion choice, Rarity.

54
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,920
They're what
she was born with.

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,090
Born where?

56
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,580
I never seen a pony
like that in these parts,

57
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,160
Except...her.

58
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,290
Well, she's probably
not from here,

59
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,590
And she's not a pony.

60
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,570
My books say that zebras come
from a faraway land.

61
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,630
But I've never seen her
in Ponyville.

62
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,910
Where does she live?

63
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,960
That's just it.

64
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,560
She lives in...
the Everfree forest.

65
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,740
Spike!

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,000
Uh, sorry.

67
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,160
The Everfree forest
just ain't natural.

68
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,610
The plants grow...

69
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,900
animals
care for themselves...

70
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,840
and the clouds move...

71
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,170
all on their own!
All on their own!
All on their own!

72
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,900
And that wicked enchantress
Zecora lives there,

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,840
Doing her evil...stuff!

74
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,300
Why, she's so evil,
I even wrote a song about her.

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,730
Here we go.

76
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,290
* she's an evil
enchantress *

77
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,590
* she does evil dances

78
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,050
* and if you look
deep in her eyes *

79
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,520
* she'll put you in trances

80
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,620
* then what will she do?

81
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,050
* she'll mix up an evil brew

82
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,720
* then she'll gobble you up
in a big, tasty stew *

83
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,940
* so watch out!

84
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,200
Wow. Catchy.

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,950
It's a work
in progress.

86
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,510
This is all just
a lot of gossip and rumors.

87
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,100
Now, tell me, what exactly have
you actually seen Zecora do?

88
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,500
Well...

89
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,690
once a month,
she comes into Ponyville.

90
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,900
Ooh!

91
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,870
Then...she lurks
by the stores.

92
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,530
Oh, my.

93
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,880
And then
she digs at the ground.

94
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,000
Good gracious!

95
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,350
Okay, I'm sorry,
but how is any of this bad?

96
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,650
Maybe she comes to town
to visit.

97
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,390
Yeah. Maybe she's just
trying to be neighborly.

98
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,970
And maybe she's not lurking
by the stores.

99
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,690
Maybe she's going to them,
lurk-Free, to do some shopping.

100
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,170
Yeah.
Everypony likes to shop.

101
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,230
You know what I think?

102
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,600
Apple Bloom, hush
and let the big ponies talk.

103
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,690
I am a big pony.

104
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,350
What about
digging at the ground?

105
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,880
You've got to admit
that's weird.

106
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,900
What if she's digging
for innocent creatures?

107
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,180
I am sure there's an explanation
for everything Zecora does.

108
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,920
And if anypony here

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,890
Were actually brave enough
to approach her,

110
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,320
She would find out
the truth.

111
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,140
Well, I'm brave enough.
I'm gonna find out myself.

112
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,480
You ponies
are being ridiculous!

113
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,510
Well, I heard
that Zecora eats hay.

114
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,640
Pinkie, I eat hay.
You eat hay.

115
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,380
Yeah, but I heard it's
the e-E-Evil way she eats hay.

116
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,690
Hey!
Where's Apple Bloom?

117
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,890
Fluttershy:
the door's open.

118
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,150
She went outside!

119
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,420
And Zecora's
still out there.

120
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,220
That silly
little filly.

121
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,120
I told her
to stay put.

122
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,250
Spike, you stay here in case
Apple Bloom comes back.

123
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,450
Will do!

124
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,260
Apple Bloom?!

125
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,320
You get back here
right now!

126
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,280
Beware! Beware,
you pony folk!

127
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,770
Those leaves of blue
are not a joke.

128
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,000
Y-You keep
your creepy mumbo jumbo

129
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,230
To yourself, you hear!

130
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,010
Yeah!

131
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,570
Ha! Was that
supposed to scare us?!

132
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,860
* she'll gobble
you up *

133
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,410
* in a big,
tasty stew *

134
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,730
Oh, brother.

135
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,310
Beware! Beware!

136
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,930
Yeah!
Back at you, Zecora!

137
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,310
You and your lame
curse are the ones
who'd better beware!

138
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,630
And you!

139
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,900
Why couldn't you just
listen to your big sister?

140
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,410
I-I...

141
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,940
who knows
what kind of nasty curse

142
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,410
Zecora could have just
put on you?

143
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,970
Just like in my song.

144
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,370
* evil enchantress!

145
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,620
* with the dances!

146
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,970
* and the trances!

147
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,620
You guys, there's
no such thing as curses.

148
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,770
Well, that's
interesting to hear

149
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,890
Coming from
miss magic pants herself.

150
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,170
My magic, real magic,
comes from within.

151
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,930
It's a skill
you're born with.

152
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,450
Curses are artificial,
fake magic.

153
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,900
It's conjured with potions
and incantations --

154
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,650
All smoke and mirrors
meant to scare.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,670
But curses
have no real power.

156
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,190
They're just
an old pony tale.

157
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,770
Just you wait,
Twilight.

158
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,530
You're gonna learn that
some pony tales really are true.

159
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,680
* she's an evil enchantress!

160
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,180
* she does evil dances!

161
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,080
Beware! Beware!

162
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,090
* if you look deep in her eyes

163
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,850
* she will put you
in trances! *

164
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,370
Yeah, was that
supposed to scare us?!

165
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,690
Wicked, wicked zebra.

166
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,300
Curse.

167
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,640
* then what will she do?!

168
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,270
Just you wait, Twilight.
Some pony tales really are true.

169
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,640
* then she'll
gobble you up *

170
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,030
* in a big, tasty stew

171
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,230
Ohhh...watch out!

172
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,810
Ugh. What a dream.

173
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,790
Curses, schmurses.

174
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,880
Whoa.

175
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,790
Maybe Zecora cursed
my hair.

176
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,490
Or she cursed my horn!

177
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,020
No, no, no, no, no!

178
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,630
None of these books have a cure.

179
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,860
There has to be
a real reason for this!

180
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,960
An illness?
An allergy?!

181
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,190
A curse!

182
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,000
I said a real reason --

183
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,370
Something that points
to something real.

184
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,660
How about this one?

185
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,060
"Supernaturals"?

186
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,300
Spike, the word
"supernatural"

187
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,090
Refers to things like ghosts
and spirits and zombies,

188
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,210
Which are
as make-Believe as curses.

189
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,180
This book
is just a bunch of hooey.

190
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,060
But what if you're wrong,
Twilight?

191
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,240
What if this
really is a --

192
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,340
A pfurse!

193
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,330
A purse?
How could it be a purse?

194
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,650
Pinkie!
What happened?!

195
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,200
Pee pah pah pfurse pah!
Pee pah pah pfurse pah pah!

196
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,840
Hey, say it,
don't spray it, Pinkie!

197
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,510
Rainbow Dash: ow!

198
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,110
Oh!

199
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,150
She's --

200
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,330
Trying to say -- Ow!

201
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,230
Zecora -- Oh!

202
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,420
She slapped us all
with a -- Ow!

203
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,620
...curse!

204
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,380
I'm afraid
I have to agree.

205
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,890
Pftblblt!

206
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,290
I hate to say

207
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,200
I told you so, Twilight,
but I told you so!

208
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,240
It's a curse,
I tells ya!

209
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,450
But Fluttershy
seems just fine.

210
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,380
Yes.

211
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,630
There doesn't seem to be
a thing wrong with her.

212
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,630
Fluttershy?
Are you okay?

213
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,740
Is there something
wrong with you?

214
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,680
Would you
care to tell us?

215
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,370
So...
you're not gonna tell us?

216
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,650
"Yes, you're not,"
or "yes, you will?"

217
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,030
Good gravy, girl!
What's wrong with you?!

218
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,370
I don't want to talk about it.

219
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,150
This is hilarious!
Look at all of you!

220
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
We got hair-ity...

221
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,220
Rainbow Crash...

222
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,640
Spitty Pie...

223
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,860
Apple-Tini...

224
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,850
Flutterguy...

225
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,470
and...uh...

226
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,460
I got nothing.

227
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,910
"Twilight Sparkle" --

228
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,230
I mean, seriously,
I can't even work with that.

229
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,660
Ah-Ha-Ha-Ha.
This is no joke, Spike.

230
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,300
Now, start looking for more
books so I can find a cure.

231
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,140
I think we'll find a cure
to this curse at Zecora's place!

232
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,070
It's not a curse!

233
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,270
I agree with Dash.

234
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,890
We'll go to Zecora's and
force her to remove this hex.

235
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,830
It's not a hex either!

236
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,540
That woman's
got to be stopped.

237
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,980
This is all
my fault.

238
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,200
If I hadn't followed Zecora
in the first place,

239
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,740
None of this
would have happened.

240
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,160
I just got to fix this.

241
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,730
Now, where does she think
she's going this time?

242
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,750
I don't care what you say,
Twilight!

243
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,450
It's time to pony up
and confront Zecora!

244
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,700
Come on, girls.
Are you with me?!

245
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,820
I am-Pft!

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
And I, as well.

247
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,210
Oh, I don't know.
Seems awfully dangerous.

248
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,080
How about you,
Applejack?

249
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,670
Applejack?

250
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,600
pf-She's gone-Pft!

251
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,280
Aah!
Somepony stepped on her!

252
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,900
Or sat on her?

253
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,070
Rarity's hair!

254
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,830
Oh! Oh!
Pinkie, what are you doing?

255
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,660
Really -- Ow!

256
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,430
Ever hear
of personal space?!

257
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,700
Nope!

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,550
Apple Bloom
is gone, too.

259
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,720
I bet
they went after Zecora.

260
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,280
Well, we'd better
go find them.

261
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,300
Aah!

262
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,770
Come on, girls.
Let's go.

263
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,380
Oh, dear!

264
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,020
Oh, this
is so unseemly. Aah!

265
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,110
Hey,
a little help here?

266
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,440
Oopsie. Sorry.

267
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,960
Ow!

268
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,250
Uh, s-Spike?
A-Are you coming?

269
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,010
Nope.

270
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,370
Uh...

271
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,000
got to stay here
and look for a cure.

272
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,500
Twilight flopple!

273
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
Stop right there!

274
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,710
Turn around right now, missy!

275
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,840
No!

276
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,790
No?!

277
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,930
You can't ignore a direct order
from your big sister!

278
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,260
Sorry, Applejack,
but I'm the big sister now.

279
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,760
Apple Bloom, you come back here
right this instant!

280
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,830
I'm gonna tell
Big Macintosh on you!

281
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,930
Oh, pony feathers.

282
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,690
Come on, girls.
We've got to get to Zecora's.

283
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,490
Hurry!

284
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,860
Oh!

285
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,480
Easier said than done.

286
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,630
Hey! Wait for me!

287
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,500
Oof!

288
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,970
Rainbow! Thank Celestia!
There's no time to lose!

289
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,750
I need to get
to Zecora's pronto!

290
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,170
Giddy up, pony!

291
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,260
Excuse me?!

292
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,840
Yee-Haw!

293
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,130
What the...

294
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,050
no, Rainbow Dash!
Other way!

295
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,090
Oh!
I look horrible!

296
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,640
Plis place
plooks horrible!

297
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,720
Oh, my.

298
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,180
That place
really does look horrible.

299
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,780
Nice decorations --
If you like creepy!

300
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,230
Pfhe psole my psung!
Pshe spluh mm mm!

301
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,890
She stole your song?

302
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,040
Oh, Pinkie.

303
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,280
It doesn't sound
anything like your song.

304
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,840
Hmm. 

305
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,870
* she's an evil
enchantress *

306
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,950
* and she does
evil dances *

307
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,150
* and if you look
deep in her eyes *

308
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,460
* she will put you
in trances *

309
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,790
* then what
will she do? *

310
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,530
* she'll mix up
an evil brew *

311
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,420
* then she'll
gobble you up *

312
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,460
* in a big,
tasty stew *

313
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,680
* so...

314
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,940
* watch out

315
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,020
You saw
those terrible things.

316
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,120
Now do you believe us,
Twilight?

317
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,180
Scary-Looking masks,
confusing incantations,

318
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,090
And a great, big
bubbling cauldron?

319
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,110
Oh, everything is pointing
to Zecora being...bad.

320
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,190
Or...what if Zecora's
just making soup?

321
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,650
Mmm!

322
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,820
The perfect temperature
for ponies, I presume.

323
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,820
Now, where is
that little Apple Bloom?

324
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,840
Or...what if she's making
Apple Bloom soup?!

325
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,090
What if she's making
Apple Bloom soup?!

326
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm coming for you,
Apple Bloom!

327
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,790
Aaaah!

328
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,410
oof!

329
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,890
Whoa, there! Aah!

330
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,600
Heel, Rainbow Crash!

331
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,510
What have you done
with Apple Bloom?!

332
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,080
No! No!

333
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,050
Ponies,
what is this you --

334
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,440
No! You know not
what you do!

335
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,890
You've gone and spilled
my precious brew!

336
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,940
We're onto you,
Zecora.

337
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,930
I didn't want to believe
that you cursed us,

338
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,000
But the evidence
is overwhelming.

339
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,010
You made me look
ridiculous.

340
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,290
You made me sound
ridiculous.

341
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,090
Pfe pfuh pfuh pfound
puh-Pluh-Pli-Plus!

342
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,050
You ruined my horn!

343
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,670
How dare you?!

344
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,700
You destroy my home,
destroy my work,

345
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,620
Then rudely accuse me
of being a jerk?!

346
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,180
You put this curse on us,
now you're gonna un-Curse us!

347
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,020
It is unwise to venture
down this road.

348
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,270
Your actions
will make my anger explode!

349
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,520
Where is Apple Bloom?

350
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,000
Zecora, I think I found
all the things you asked for.

351
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,490
What in Ponyville
is going on here?

352
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,110
Apple Bloom! You're okay!

353
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,110
Why wouldn't I be?

354
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,940
Because Zecora
is an evil enchantress

355
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,350
Who cursed us and was gonna
cook you up into soup.

356
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,160
Oh, Twilight.

357
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,130
Did those silly fillies
finally get in your head?

358
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,550
You know there's
no such thing as a curse.

359
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,320
Apple Bloom, sweetie,

360
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,010
You can't just stand there
and tell me this isn't a curse.

361
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,090
This isn't a curse.

362
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,030
If you
will remember back,

363
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,730
The words I spoke
were quite exact.

364
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,370
Beware! Beware,
you pony folk!

365
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,960
Those leaves of blue
are not a joke.

366
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,040
It was a warning
about that blue plant.

367
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,040
It's called "poison joke."

368
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,870
That plant
is much like poison oak,

369
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,570
But its results
are like a joke.

370
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,150
What in the hay
does that mean?

371
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,060
It means this plant
does not breed wrath.

372
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,150
Instead, this plant
just wants a laugh.

373
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,600
Will somepony
please talk normal?

374
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,380
I think
what she's saying

375
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,730
Is that when we ran in
to save Apple Bloom,

376
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,850
We ran into
the poison joke.

377
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,180
All our problems are just
little jokes it played on us.

378
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,000
Little jokes?!
Very funny.

379
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,220
Okay. Fine.
But what about the cauldron?

380
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,820
And the chanting?

381
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,390
And the creepy decor?

382
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,920
Treasures of the native land
where I am from.

383
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,250
This one speaks "hello,"
and this -- "Welcome."

384
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,140
Not welcoming at all,
if you ask me.

385
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,930
The words I chanted
were from olden times --

386
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,470
Something you call
a nursery rhyme.

387
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,310
But the cauldron,
the Apple Bloom soup?

388
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,870
Looky here, Twilight, that pot
of water wasn't for me.

389
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,920
It was for all these
herbal ingredients.

390
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,370
The cure for poison joke is
a simple, old natural remedy.

391
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,190
You just got to take
a bubble bath.

392
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,610
But I tried to find a cure
in all my books

393
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,850
And couldn't find
anything.

394
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,300
What book
has this natural remedy?

395
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,710
Here is the book. You see?

396
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,870
Sad that you lack it
in your library.

397
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,980
Actually,
I do have this book.

398
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,050
But I didn't look inside because
the title was so...weird.

399
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,060
"Supernaturals --

400
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,330
Natural remedies and cure-alls
that are simply super."

401
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,510
I...i...

402
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm so sorry, Zecora.

403
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,450
I had the answer
the whole time,

404
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,710
If only I'd bothered
to look inside.

405
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,360
Maybe next time

406
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,980
You will
take a second look

407
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,540
And not judge
the cover of the book.

408
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,150
Zecora,
would you be kind enough

409
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,280
To mix up another batch
of the herbal bath?

410
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,750
Mix it up,
I certainly will.

411
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,050
Yet I am missing
an herb from Ponyville.

412
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,210
But whenever
Zecora comes to town,

413
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,870
All the shops
are mysteriously closed.

414
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,400
Oh, well, I think
we can help you with that.

415
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,200
Look, rose.
How awful!

416
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,670
The wicked enchantress
has cursed them all.

417
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,360
The horror!
The horror!

418
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,480
Everypony get inside.

419
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,620
Run, ponies! Run!

420
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,750
Daisy,
we need to talk.

421
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,940
"Dear princess Celestia,

422
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,000
"My friends and I all learned
an important lesson this week --

423
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,260
"Never judge a book
by its cover.

424
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,620
"Someone may look unusual
or funny or scary,

425
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,050
"But you have to look past that
and learn who they are inside.

426
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,580
"Real friends don't care
what your cover is.

427
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,940
"It's the contents of a pony
that count.

428
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,080
"And a good friend,
like a good book,

429
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,940
"Is something
that will last forever.

430
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,770
Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle."

431
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,770
Miss Zecora, I would love to get
the recipe for this bath.

432
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,970
It's simply luxurious.

433
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,730
Applejack!

434
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,820
Hey!
Where's Applejack?!

435
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,690
I'm right here,
little sis.

436
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,600
I ain't tiny no more.

437
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,720
Oh!

438
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,700
I have never felt so lovely
in all my life.

439
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,990
Oh, my gosh!

440
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,140
I never realized how horrible
it is not to be able to talk!

441
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,530
I mean,
I love talking so much,

442
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,330
And when I couldn't talk
anymore,

443
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,990
My tongue was all...
aaaah!

444
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,250
It was the worst!
Don't you agree, Fluttershy?

445
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,780
Yes.
