1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,275
Lunch time!

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:05,175
Who's hungry?

3
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:07,875
Plenty for everypony.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,135
Slow down, sweetie.

5
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,785
Here you go, Angel bunny.

6
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:31,555
Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win.

7
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:34,555
Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum yum yum!

8
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:36,965
What? But--

9
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,835
Then, what will you eat?

10
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,365
I'm not sure I can even make that.

11
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:54,425
Well, I don't want you to starve...

12
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,835
Are you sure I can't tempt you
with a nice crisp piece of--

13
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:01,825
I'll make your special recipe.

14
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:08,725


15
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:14,325


16
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:37,455


17
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:44,675
Hmm, let's see.
Asparagus.

18
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,785
Excuse me... I think you just
stepped in front of me...?

19
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:56,965
Excuse me, I think you made a mistake?

20
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:57,965
You see I was actually here first and--

21
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,855
Sorry, didn't notice you there.

22
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,875
I know.

23
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:04,985
Pardon me, sir.

24
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:06,765
Yes, what?

25
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,975
I think you just cut in front of me.

26
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,915
A cut of celery?
But, this is the asparagus stand!

27
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:16,805
I said, I think you just cut
in front of me.

28
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:20,495
No need, dearie, I'm already in front!

29
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:22,575
I noticed.

30
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:24,115
Hey!

31
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,855
Would you mind moving back?
You're in my personal space.

32
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:29,295
But--

33
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:31,555
Seriously, do you need
your asparagus so badly?

34
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:32,595
Get a life.

35
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,915
Oh, okay. There's no rush.

36
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:37,475
Fluttershy!

37
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,995
You mustn't let them treat you that way.

38
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:42,345
It's really no big deal...

39
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,945
It's bigger than big, it's double big.

40
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:47,195
You are a pony with a problem.

41
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:48,495
What problem?

42
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:55,765
Go right ahead Pinkie Pie, you first.

43
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:58,115
Right there! That's the problem.

44
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,535
You've got to stop being such a doormat.

45
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:02,245
A doormat?

46
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:04,625
A pushover, darling.

47
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,595
You've got to stand up for yourself.

48
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:07,505
Promise us.

49
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,005
Okay. I promise.

50
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:11,205
Oh, good!

51
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,155
That's okay, I don't mind.

52
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:16,985
Watch and learn.

53
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:17,905
Hold it right there,

54
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,715
mister small and handsome!

55
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:21,715
Who, me?

56
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:23,355
Of course, you.

57
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:26,245
Nopony ever called you handsome before?

58
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,315
That'd be a big no.

59
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:30,625
Well they should!

60
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,525
How about flexing
some of your muscles for me?

61
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:37,425
Oh my heavens!

62
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:41,335
Do you think a strong, handsome stallion
such as yourself

63
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,655
could give my friend the last asparagus?

64
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,255
See, that's not so hard, is it?

65
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:51,675
I guess not...

66
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:54,375
Alright then! What else is on your list?

67
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:57,405
Let's see... I also need tomatoes.

68
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:00,915
Here you go.

69
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:05,155
That'll be two bits. Not one.

70
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:07,285
But last week it was only one bit.

71
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:08,925
That was then, this is now.

72
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:10,195
Okay.

73
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,035
I don't wanna argue about it.

74
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,745
What do you think you're doing?

75
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,465
Mindin' my own business,
maybe you should try it.

76
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,275
Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous.

77
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,175
One bit is the right price.

78
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:22,105
I say it's two bits.

79
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:24,145
One bit.

80
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:25,645
Two bits!

81
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:26,645
One bit!

82
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:28,465
- Two bits!
- One bit!

83
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:29,465
Two bits!

84
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:31,245
- Two bits!
- One bit!

85
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:32,645
- Two bits!
- One bit!

86
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:34,795
I insist, it's two bits or nothing!

87
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:36,795
One bit and that's my final offer!

88
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,205
Have it your way, one bit it is!

89
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,305
See? Asserting yourself can be fun!

90
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:45,855
I guess you're right!

91
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,845
So, Fluttershy,
do you feel like giving it a try?

92
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,685
Um... okay.

93
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:54,505
I need that cherry.

94
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:57,295
Am I glad you have one cherry left.

95
00:04:57,445 --> 00:04:59,865
You see, I'm making this special meal
for my bunny Angel

96
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:03,185
he's a very picky eater,
and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.

97
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:05,175
Here you go.

98
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,445
So,

99
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:09,305
you say you need
this cherry very badly.

100
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,665
Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!

101
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:13,195
Then it'll be ten bits!

102
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,495
Ten?!

103
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,545
Oh, hey, mister handsome.

104
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,675
I know you wanna do the right thing,
because you're handsome and strong

105
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,785
and big, handsome, strong guys
are always nice to everypony, right?

106
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:31,775
Ten bits for the cherry.

107
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,975
Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous!

108
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,145
I insist on paying you... eleven bits!

109
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,195
Eleven bits?

110
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:41,925
I mean, nine bits!

111
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,355
Now wait a minute...

112
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:46,195
Okay, twelve bits,
but that's my final offer!

113
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,795
I think you're confused.

114
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,955
It's twelve bits, take it or leave it.

115
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:51,315
Okay, I'll take it.

116
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:52,795
Don't give him your money!

117
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:55,095
One cherry is not worth twelve bits!

118
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:57,685
But... I was only doing what you did.

119
00:05:57,835 --> 00:06:00,325
It was a valiant effort,
but you should refuse to give him

120
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,095
your business and just walk away.

121
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:04,415
But... I can't let Angel starve!

122
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:07,145
He won't eat it unless
I make it just right!

123
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:09,805
I need that cherry
no matter what it costs!

124
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:12,245
In that case, twenty bits!

125
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:16,265
Twenty?!
Oh, but I don't have that much.

126
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,095
Then why're you wasting my time?

127
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,885
I'll give you two bits for that cherry!

128
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:20,585
Sold!

129
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:23,945
That's a break, kid.
Next time, don't be such a doormat.

130
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:33,725
Here you go, Angel.

131
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,695
Sorry there's no cherry on top,

132
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:38,095
but the rest of it is exactly
what you wanted.

133
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:40,965
Angel?

134
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:48,195
Look at me... I really am a doormat.

135
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:51,315
The incredible Iron Will

136
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,865
turns doormats into dynamos.

137
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:56,875
Assertiveness seminar today,
hedge maze centre.

138
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:00,825
As Celestia is my witness,

139
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:03,955
I'm never gonna be a pushover again!

140
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,005
Excuse me!

141
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,105
Welcome, friends! My name is Iron Will.

142
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:57,425
And today is the first day
of your new life!

143
00:07:57,565 --> 00:08:01,255
I wanna hear you stomp
if you're tired of being a pushover!

144
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:07,805
Stomp if you're tired of being a doormat!

145
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:13,175
Stomp if you wanna pay nothing
for this seminar!

146
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:23,345
That's no joke, friends.

147
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:28,455
Iron Will is so confident that you will be
one hundred percent satisfied

148
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,945
with Iron Will's assertiveness techniques,

149
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:36,265
that if you are not one hundred percent
satisfied, you... pay... nothing.

150
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:39,855
But I pity the fool who doubts
Iron Will's methods.

151
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:41,455
You don't doubt me, do you?

152
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,785
Uh-uh, no sir...

153
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:46,355
That, my friends, is your first lesson.

154
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,185
"Don't be shy, look 'em in the eye."

155
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,725
Now, to demonstrate that

156
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,405
Iron Will's techniques
will work for anypony,

157
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:58,605
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

158
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,545
You, in the back row!

159
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:12,745
Who, me?

160
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:16,575
Yes, you! Iron Will wants you onstage!

161
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:18,765
Uh, well...

162
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:20,165
Now!

163
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:21,565
Okay...

164
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,055
He’s blocking your path.

165
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:32,435
What are you gonna do about it?

166
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:34,575
Um, politely walk around him?

167
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:35,605
No.

168
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,415
Gingerly tip-toe around him?

169
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:38,405
No.

170
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:39,945
Go back home, and try again tomorrow?

171
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,955
No!

172
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:45,295
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

173
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,055
Oh! Sorry.

174
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:52,175
Don’t be sorry, be assertive!

175
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:55,755
"Never apologize, when you can criticize."

176
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:58,875
Why don’t you watch where you’re going!?

177
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,375
Now, you try.

178
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:07,985
Next time, get out of the way before...
I bump into you.

179
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:12,655
Because...
I totally won’t be sorry when I do!

180
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,785
You see my friends!?

181
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:19,455
If my techniques can work
for this shy, little pony,

182
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,645
then they can work for anypony!

183
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,805
Okay, I feel good.

184
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:32,655
I feel ready to "attack the day",

185
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:34,005
as Iron Will says.

186
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:40,225
Excuse me, Mr. Greenhooves,

187
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,825
but I think you might be
over-watering my petunias...

188
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,025
again...

189
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:47,405
Let the professional handle it.

190
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:55,185
"Treat me like a pushover,
and you'll get the once over."

191
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:08,015
Perhaps that is enough water.

192
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:09,115
Thank you.

193
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:13,625
I can't believe it worked!

194
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,355
Showpony business is tough.

195
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:19,135
Go ahead, try one of your jokes out on me.

196
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:20,435
I laugh at everything.

197
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:21,435
Okay, okay, okay.

198
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:25,435
A donkey and a mule
are stuck on a desert island...

199
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,325
Excuse me?

200
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:29,555
Would you mind moving your carts,
so I can pass?

201
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:32,025
Yeah yeah, in a minute,
I just wanna finish up this story.

202
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:34,715
And so the donkey says to the mule--

203
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:38,265
Can you move, you're blocking my path.

204
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:41,265
Yeah yeah, in a minute!
So the donkey says to the mule...

205
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:44,835
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

206
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:53,255
Easy does it, lady. We're moving, okay?

207
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,455
Good!

208
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,455
Who's next, please, and what

209
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:01,865
can I get for you today?

210
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:04,785
What do you think you're doing?

211
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:05,985
Didn't you see me?

212
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:07,725
Uh, I guess maybe.

213
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,605
"Maybe"?
"Maybes are for babies!"

214
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,685
Now go to the back of the line,

215
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,245
where you belong!

216
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,555
Hey, look at you!

217
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:27,485
Your attitude is so feisty.

218
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,895
It's fabulous.

219
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:31,135
Looks like that monster's workshop
really paid off!

220
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:34,015
Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur.

221
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,045
And a true inspiration.

222
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:37,565
His techniques really work.

223
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,825
Well, they've certainly made a difference
in the way you carry yourself.

224
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,395
You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.

225
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:46,305
Yes, I am.
And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked

226
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,165
about new Fluttershy.

227
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:51,085
Well, old Pinkie Pie feels
really proud of new Fluttershy.

228
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,225
Proud as pink punch.

229
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:54,975
Want some?

230
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,935
"You laugh at me, I wrath at you!"

231
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,505
Bye, girls.

232
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,125
What a day.

233
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:11,675
Taxi!

234
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,515
Oh no you don't.

235
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:20,005
"Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!"

236
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:27,455
Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around!

237
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,605
NOPONY!

238
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,115
Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure

239
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,225
new Fluttershy is such
a good idea after all.

240
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,105
Old Rarity agrees.

241
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,715
You got this, new Fluttershy!

242
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,495
This day is yours!

243
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,605
And nopony's gonna take it away from you!

244
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:49,305
Am I right?!

245
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:50,885
Right!

246
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:55,895
What?! He's delivered
the wrong mail, again!

247
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:05,435
And new Fluttershy does not want
the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.

248
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:08,075
Did I mix them up again?

249
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,945
Sorry about that.

250
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:13,135
"You apologize, I penalize!"

251
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:26,445
Excuse me, do you know how
to get to the Ponyville tower?

252
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:28,115
Sure, you just--

253
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:32,945
That's a shame.

254
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,915
"You make me lose, I blow my fuse!"

255
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:44,405
Fluttershy! What are you doing?!

256
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:46,155
That's no way to behave.

257
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:48,585
Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy?

258
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:51,645
And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!

259
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:55,395
No, sweetie, he didn't.
We saw the whole thing.

260
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,195
We think that you've taken
your assertiveness training

261
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,495
a little too far.

262
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:00,795
What?!

263
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:04,745
You just want new Fluttershy
to be a doormat like old Fluttershy!

264
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,685
But old Fluttershy is GONE!

265
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:10,635
New Fluttershy... old Fluttershy...!?

266
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,885
What happened to nice Fluttershy?

267
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:14,365
We want that Fluttershy back.

268
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:18,905
No, you want wimp Fluttershy.
You want pushover Fluttershy.

269
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:22,545
You want do-anything-to-her
and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!

270
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:27,175
Too many Fluttershies to keep track of!
Make it stop!

271
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:30,935
Things getting too complicated for
your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?

272
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:34,245
Now, stop right there!

273
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:37,055
Let's not let things descend
into petty insults!

274
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:40,745
Why not? I thought "petty"
was what you're all about, Rarity.

275
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,865
With your "petty" concerns about fashion.

276
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:47,315
Hey, leave her alone!
Fashion is her passion!

277
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:51,765
Oh, and what are you passionate about?
Birthday cake? Party hats?

278
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,915
I can't believe that the two most
frivolous ponies in Ponyville

279
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,725
are trying to tell new Fluttershy
how to live her life

280
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,895
when they are throwing their own lives
away on pointless pursuits,

281
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:04,225
that nopony else gives
a flying feather about!

282
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:08,425
Looks like nasty Fluttershy
is here to stay!

283
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:13,275
I cannot believe what that monster,
Iron Will, has done to you!

284
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:20,085
Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!

285
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,185
...I'm the monster.

286
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,975
Fluttershy, are you in there?

287
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,185
It's Pinkie Pie, and Rarity!

288
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:50,235
Go away! Go away before
nasty Fluttershy strikes again!

289
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:53,495
Oh, sweetie,
we all said things that we regret.

290
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:54,595
We did?

291
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:57,445
Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame.

292
00:16:57,645 --> 00:17:00,745
But don't worry, I'm never
coming out of my house again.

293
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,185
Everypony will be a lot safer with me
and my mean mouth locked away.

294
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,175
Sweetie,

295
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,145
Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you,
nor do I.

296
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,185
You just received some bad advice
from that Iron Will character.

297
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:15,855
Yeah! He's the one that
made you act super-duper nasty.

298
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:17,635
What I mean is,

299
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:21,295
there are other ways to assert yourself
besides yelling at everypony.

300
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:21,865
Yes!

301
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:25,505
You can stand up for yourself
without being unpleasant about it.

302
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,745
I'm not sure I can.

303
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,345
I'm too far gone.

304
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:30,605
Whenever I try to assert myself,

305
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:32,395
I become a monster.

306
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:37,215
Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.

307
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:38,515
No, but he is.

308
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:43,415
Iron Will's my name,
training ponies is my game.

309
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,665
What a darling little catchphrase.

310
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,935
Your friend Fluttershy loved
Iron Will's catchphrases.

311
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:54,475
Word on the street is that
she doesn't take no duff from nopony!

312
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,535
So, Iron Will is here
to collect Iron Will's fee.

313
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:01,515
Fluttershy's in no shape
to deal with that creep!

314
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:06,195
I'm sure a big, brave,
powerful and rich monster--

315
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:08,765
I mean, minotaur, like you,

316
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,855
doesn't need that money right away.

317
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:12,295
You can afford to come back later.

318
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,985
Are you kidding?
Fluttershy is overdue as it is.

319
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,315
Iron Will collects now.

320
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:20,985
Do something!

321
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:24,115
We're not even sure
Fluttershy is home right now.

322
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:26,825
She might be off frolicking
with some woodland creatures.

323
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:28,955
Why don't you give us some time
to track her down for ya?

324
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:32,135
Iron Will does have some
grocery shopping to do.

325
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,325
Iron Will will come back this afternoon.

326
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,945
But that's only half a day.

327
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,995
We need one full day at least.

328
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:43,125
Iron Will will delay for half a day
and no longer!

329
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:44,145
A full day!

330
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,145
Half day!

331
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:45,845
Full day!

332
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:46,845
Half day!

333
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:47,845
Half day!

334
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:48,795
Full day!

335
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,245
We need half a day and no more!

336
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,735
You'll get a full day and no less!

337
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:55,815
Okie dokie. See you tomorrow.

338
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:56,715
Wait, what?

339
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,295
Sounds like the search
won't be necessary.

340
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:03,855
Iron Will collects now.

341
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,855
But we had an agreement!
You gotta come back tomorrow!

342
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:10,965
"When somepony tries to block,
show them that you rock!"

343
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:18,945
Your payment is overdue, Fluttershy!

344
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:29,115
You were nothing but a doormat!

345
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:33,305
And Iron Will turned you into a lean,
mean, assertive machine!

346
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,985
Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will!

347
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:40,275
Um, no.

348
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:45,055
What did you say?

349
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,065
No.

350
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:48,975
I'd hate to be you right now.

351
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:52,175
Because Iron Will is gonna
rain down a world of hurt

352
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:55,705
unless Iron Will gets his money pronto!

353
00:19:57,245 --> 00:19:59,675
As I recall, during your workshop,
you promised

354
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,975
one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed

355
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:03,015
or you pay nothing.

356
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:05,265
Well, I'm not satisfied.

357
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,295
What do you mean, you're not satisfied?!

358
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:09,845
Everypony has always been satisfied!

359
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:11,745
Well I guess I'm the first then.

360
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:12,845
But since I'm not satisfied,

361
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,225
I refuse to pay.

362
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:15,345
It's as simple as that.

363
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,795
Are you sure you're not
just a little bit satisfied?

364
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,945
Because maybe... we could, cut a deal...

365
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,825
I mean, we're both reasonable creatures,
aren't we?

366
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:35,855
I'm sorry, but no means no.

367
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:37,935
No means no, huh?

368
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:40,265
Nopony's ever said that to me before.

369
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:42,415
I gotta remember that one.

370
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:45,465
That's a good catchphrase
for my next workshop.

371
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,445
You're amazing, Fluttershy!

372
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:50,575
You totally stood up to that monster!

373
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:52,085
In fact, you didn't change at all!

374
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:55,575
You were the same old Fluttershy
that we've always loved!

375
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:57,375
The one we missed!

376
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,985
Don't worry,
old Fluttershy's back for good.

377
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:03,065
I'm sorry I took the whole
assertiveness thing too far.

378
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,375
Friends?

379
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:07,935
Friends!

380
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:11,465
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

381
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:15,635
<i>Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony
like me to stand up for myself.</i>

382
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:16,885
<i>And when I first tried it,</i>

383
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:18,745
<i>I didn't like the pony I became.</i>

384
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,735
<i>But I've learned that standing up
for yourself isn't the same</i>

385
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,545
<i>as changing who you are.</i>

386
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:28,515
<i>Now I know how to put my hoof down,
without being unpleasant, or mean.</i>
