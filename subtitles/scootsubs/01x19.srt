1
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,610
Perfect.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,400
Coming!
Welcome to Carousel Boutique,

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,740
Where every garment is chic,
unique, and magnifique.

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,050
Sapphire Shores!

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,570
The pony of pop!

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,580
Good afternoon,
miss Rarity.

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,930
Y-You know my name?

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,610
Well, of course I do,
darling.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,630
I make it a point
to know

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,540
All of the up-And-Coming
designers,

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,370
And clothes horse magazine
simply raved about you.

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,550
Oh, my stars.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,580
If I'm dreaming,
do not wake me up.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,040
How may I help you,
miss Shores?

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,720
Oh,
please call me Sapphire.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,380
How may I help you,
Sapphire?

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,710
Well,
as I'm sure you know,

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,850
I'll be touring all of Equestria
with my latest concert --

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,130
Sapphire Shores
zigfilly follies!

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,480
So I need to look
se-E-E-Nsational!

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,210
Oww!

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,300
I have
just what you need.

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,600
Sapphire Shores,
prepare yourself

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,410
For the pièce de résistance
de la haute couture.

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,560
I used every last diamond
I found on this one garment.

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,320
And it is spectacular!

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,250
I'll take it.

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,310
Really?

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,370
Oh, yes.

30
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,100
And five more, each done up
in a different jewel.

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,850
Beg pardon?

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Costume changes.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,420
Ohh!

34
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,190
Yes, I do have that effect
on ponies.

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,280
Oh, my gosh!
Sapphire Shores!

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,090
The pony of pop!

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,450
She is awesome!

39
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,100
I mean, she's gorgeous
and talented and...

40
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,090
And -- Not even half the pony
you are.

41
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,360
I mean, you're 10 times more
gorgeous and talented and --

42
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,150
Spike,
a lady is never jealous.

43
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,240
O-Of course not.

44
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,590
But were you totally
flipping out or what?

45
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,340
Ladies do not flip out,
Spike.

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,950
However, I was quite in awe.

47
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,370
Ooh, I need to find more jewels
than ever before

48
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,010
To decorate her costumes.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,480
Ooh! Aha!

50
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,550
Did you find some?

51
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,050
Yes, Spike!
Right there!

52
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,600
Ooh!

53
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,690
You look so...delicious.

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,720
Spike!

55
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,870
I promised I'd give you gems
to snack on,

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,620
But we need to collect more
first,

57
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,260
Or I'll never be able to make
these outfits for Sapphire.

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,720
I will miss you, my sweets.

59
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,010
Come along, Spike.
We have many jewels to find.

60
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,470
At your service, my lady.

61
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,210
Spike!

62
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,230
You've been very patient today,
Spike.

63
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,970
And for that,
you get the finest reward.

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,520
This is from me to you.

65
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,840
Is something wrong,
Spike?

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,270
No.

67
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,300
It's perfect.

68
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,120
Ooh, bring the cart,
Spike.

69
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,530
There are more
over here.

70
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,690
For me, from Rarity.

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,910
Glass gems!

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,880
Gems!

73
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,690
Where?
Precious gems.

74
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,550
He is the gem hunter.

75
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,270
With him, we can have
all those gems and more.

76
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,100
Let's get the dragon.

77
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,950
Spike, where are you?

78
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,960
Wait!
Who is that?

79
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,490
You know, it's terrible
to keep a lady waiting.

80
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,990
Coming!

81
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,940
I think we're really going to
strike gold this time.

82
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,170
So to speak.

83
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,300
Jackpot!

84
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,040
Ooh,
it's not the dragon we want.

85
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,250
It's the pony.

86
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,810
Yeah, pony.
Yeah, pony.

87
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,660
Well, Spike.

88
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,300
I think that's all we can do
for today,

89
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,240
And these will certainly get me
well on my way

90
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,400
With Sapphire's outfits.

91
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,910
Why don't
we start heading --

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,210
ooh! What's this?

93
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,380
Another jewel!

94
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,980
Oh, oh, strange.

95
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,420
It's in the trees.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,550
Ooh.

97
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,510
Aah!

98
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,220
Uh, good day,
gentle...fellow.

99
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,030
Uh, I am Rarity,
and this is my friend, Spike.

100
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,890
And you are?

101
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,890
A diamond dog.

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,460
Oh, really?

103
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,540
Well, that explains
your fine taste in jewelry.

104
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,650
I mean, I-I-I know that diamonds
are a girl's best friend,

105
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,450
And now I know that they're
a dog's best friend, too.

106
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,100
so, um...

107
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,830
You're out hunting for gems,
as well?

108
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,320
Yes.
We hunt.

109
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,540
Uh, we?

110
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,470
We hunt for gems.

111
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,640
But you are a better hunter,
so now we hunt for you.

112
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,600
Unh!

113
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,480
Aah!

114
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,050
Run, Rarity!
Run!

115
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,520
Spike, come on!
Hurry!

116
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,930
Gotcha!
Aah!

117
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,990
Go on, Rarity!
I got him!

118
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,820
nope.

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,980
Dogs sorry, skinny one.

120
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,710
W-Wait.
Rarity.

121
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,480
Unhand me this instant,
you ruffians!

122
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,090
Put me down!

123
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,900
You brutes!

124
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,330
Rarity!

125
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,670
Spike!

126
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,020
Aah! Dirt!
Aah!

127
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,180
W-W-Where --

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,320
Spike!

129
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,060
Noooooo!

130
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,410
Spike,
can you breathe now?

131
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,330
yes.

132
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,160
I think so.

133
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,080
Good.
Now tell us what you now.

134
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,480
Yeah, 'cause all you said
earlier was...

135
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,760
Rarity! Woods! Jewels!
Dogs! Hole! Taken!

136
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,490
Save her!

137
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,320
Not a whole lot to go on there,
sport.

138
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,140
Sorry.

139
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,960
Rarity and I were in the woods
looking for jewels

140
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,310
When these creepy guys
showed up.

141
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,430
Creepy guys?

142
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,430
They called themselves
the diamond dogs.

143
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,390
They grabbed Rarity

144
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,190
And disappeared down a hole
in the ground.

145
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,940
Well,
this sounds mighty easy.

146
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,390
Just take us to that there hole,
and we'll save Rarity.

147
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,920
Holy moley,
that's a lot of holeys!

148
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,240
Come on, girls.
Let's get started.

149
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,100
Hello?

150
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,060
Ugh!

151
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,900
Quick, we got to get down one
before they're all filled up.

152
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,200
O-Oh, my.

153
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,830
Ohh! Ohh!

154
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,070
Aah!

155
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,790
We can't muscle through it!

156
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,410
We'll see about that!

157
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,000
Whew!
Heavens to betsy.

158
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,380
Now, I'm used to picking myself
up and dusting myself off,

159
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,120
But Rarity won't even touch mud
unless it's imported.

160
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,840
Oh, Rarity.

161
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,200
Oh, woe is me!

162
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,120
Whatever shall I do?

163
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,070
Aah!
Dirt! Dirt!

164
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,400
Get away, dirt!

165
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,670
Aah!
Make it stop!

166
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,360
Make it stop!
Aah!

167
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,000
Filthy, disgusting dirt.

168
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,790
It stings!
It burns!

169
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,530
Help!

170
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,100
Oh, somepony, save me!
Save me!

171
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,820
We got to save her.

172
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,810
But they blocked up
all the holes.

173
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,310
Don't mean
we can't dig them out.

174
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,130
Come on.

175
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,440
Ow!

176
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,130
Unh!

177
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,790
Get 'em!

178
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
Whoa!

179
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,330
Come on!

180
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,070
All those scary monsters
popping up everywhere.

181
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,360
Oh, poor Rarity
must be terrified.

182
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,020
Ohh.

183
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,140
Give me the baubles!
Aah!

184
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,630
Give me the beads!
Aah!

185
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,350
Where are the trinkets?
Aah!

186
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,190
Where's the treasure?!
Ohh!

187
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,110
Poor Rarity.

188
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,680
What are we gonna do?

189
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,440
I got it!

190
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,550
I'll save you, my sweet.

191
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,820
Huh?
Huh?Huh?
Huh?

192
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,910
Spike,
it is very noble of you...

193
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,510
shh!

194
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,260
...to sacrifice the gem
Rarity gave you.

195
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,130
Oh, lady Rarity,
my damsel in distress,

196
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,940
I shall save you.

197
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,910
Show yourselves, you dogs!

198
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,220
You curs!

199
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,450
Ah, there you are,
you mangy mutts.

200
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,050
Who are you calling
mutts?

201
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,410
Unleash the hounds!

202
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,830
Roar!
Roar!
Roar!

203
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,650
Now,
where is lady Rarity?

204
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,120
Spike!

205
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,560
I knew
you would save me.

206
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,160
Nothing could stop me,
my lady.

207
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,160
Ohh, Spike,
you are my hero.

208
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,180
Whoa, there, loverboy.

209
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,480
Whoa!

210
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,080
W-W-W-Whoa!

211
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,170
I've got a bite!
I've got a bite!

212
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,780
Hold on there,
little fella.

213
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,500
Applejack.

214
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,650
Twilight!

215
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,690
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

216
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,220
Wait for me!

217
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,140
Whee!

218
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,630
Aah!

219
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,330
Whee!

220
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,630
Ha ha!
It worked.

221
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,860
We're in!
Now we can finally save Rarity.

222
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,140
Um...

223
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,940
which way do we go?

224
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,210
Nooooo!

225
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,760
All these tunnels.

226
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,790
How are we ever
gonna find Rarity?

227
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,730
Guess we're just gonna have to
start going down them

228
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,660
One by one.

229
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,320
That could take
forever.

230
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,150
There's got to be a way
to narrow it down.

231
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,830
I know.

232
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,820
I bet they've taken Rarity down
the tunnel with the most gems.

233
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,620
But, Spike, Rarity's the only
one who knows how to find gems.

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,680
No, Twilight.
You can.

235
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,010
You can copy
Rarity's gem-Finding spell.

236
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,930
Oh, my gosh.
You're right.

237
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,200
Rarity showed me how she did it
awhile back.

238
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,340
If I can just remember...

239
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,680
That's it.
You did it, Twilight!

240
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,800
Come on.

241
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,840
We're coming, Rarity.

242
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,860
We'll save you.
Just hold on.

243
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,280
Oh, please,
diamond dogs.

244
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,880
Please let me go.

245
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,770
No!

246
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,930
You're
our precious little pony.

247
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,480
Forever!

248
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,750
But whatever do you want
from me?

249
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,260
Gems!

250
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,010
Yes,
the gems, the jewels.

251
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,310
Find them.
Find them all.

252
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,770
Oh, is that all?

253
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,030
There, a lovely pocket of jewels
are right there.

254
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,330
Now, if you'll be so kind
as to show me the exit...

255
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,380
good.

256
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,200
Now, dig them up, pony.

257
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:05,980
What?

258
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,890
But you said you wanted me
to find the gems.

259
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,630
Yes.
Find and then dig.

260
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,520
Dig?

261
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,470
Yes.

262
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,710
Dig.

263
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,760
Ugh.

264
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,680
What are you doing?

265
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,270
We said dig!

266
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,450
Forgive me, but prior to you
so rudely dragging me

267
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,200
Into a dirt pit,

268
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,670
I had a ponypedi, and I am
not about to chip a hoof

269
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,880
Because you dislike
my style of digging.

270
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,850
Uh!

271
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,570
Oh, for goodness' --

272
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,650
Fine!
Just stop.

273
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,460
Stop!

274
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,640
Dig, dogs.
Dig!

275
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,080
And fast.

276
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,980
If she won't dig,
she pulls.

277
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,670
I beg your pardon, but what,
pray tell, are you doing?

278
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,050
Others will dig.

279
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,200
You will haul
the wagon.

280
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,570
Precious ponypedi
will be preserved!

281
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,610
Well, somebody certainly needs
proper nail care.

282
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,770
When was the last time
you two had a manicure?

283
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,740
You're scratching up my coat
with those jagged things.

284
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,120
Please be quiet!

285
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,290
Good heavens!
What is that smell?

286
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,400
Smell?

287
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,680
Ah, mystery solved.

288
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,630
It's your breath.

289
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,010
Phew!

290
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,120
Enough!

291
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,700
Search, pony!

292
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,270
Well, since you insist.

293
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,280
But I must say
the working conditions in here

294
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,650
Are simply dreadful.

295
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,270
Musty and damp -- It's going to
wreak havoc on my mane.

296
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,540
And this air is stifling,
suffocating!

297
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,990
And when I try to get
a deep breath,

298
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,250
The stench of all you dogs
makes me nauseated.

299
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,820
You look and smell like
you haven't bathed in weeks.

300
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,330
Have you never heard of soap?

301
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,200
You could all do with a good
round of soap and water.

302
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,310
Oh, water.
Water!

303
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,450
I'm terribly thirsty.

304
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,710
Could I please have some water?

305
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,130
Good gracious,
I can't take this anymore!

306
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,940
Be quiet, pony!

307
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,380
And that's another thing.

308
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,190
I would appreciate it
if you'd stop calling me "pony."

309
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,250
I am a lady, and I wish to be
addressed as such.

310
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,810
So you may call me "miss,"
or "Rarity," or "miss Rarity."

311
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,810
Enough!

312
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,290
Y-Your whining --
I-It hurts!

313
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,960
Whining?

314
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,290
I am not whining.

315
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,650
I am complaining.

316
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,300
Do you want to hear whining?

317
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,240
this is whining!

318
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,990
Ooh,
this harness is too tight!

319
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,280
It's going to chaff!
Can't you loosen it?!

320
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,600
Ooh, it hurts,
and it's so nasty!

321
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,750
Why didn't you clean it first?

322
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,260
It's gonna leave a stain!

323
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,980
The wagon's getting heavy!

324
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,920
Why do I have to pull it?

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,530
Ugh, make it stop!

326
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,210
Stop whining!

327
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,970
But I thought
you wanted whining!

328
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,800
We'll do anything, pony.

329
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,610
Oh, uh,
we'll do anything, miss Rarity.

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,450
Anything?

331
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,840
this water is hardly sparkling,

332
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,690
But I suppose
it will have to do.

333
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,920
Wait,
why are we doing this?

334
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,720
To stop the awful noises
from the pony's mouth.

335
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,780
Remember?

336
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,370
my neck --

337
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,850
Yes, yes, I know.

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,220
This is ridiculous --
Letting a pony order us around.

339
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,410
What are we?
Mice or dogs?

340
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,510
Mi-- Uh, dogs?
Dogs?

341
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,450
Dogs do not pull.

342
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,530
Ponies pull.

343
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,590
Let her make
the awful noises.

344
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,260
Huh?
What are you doing?

345
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,940
Hey!
You spilled my drink.

346
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,090
Oh!
not so tight!

347
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,830
Ha!

348
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,130
Make the noises all you want,
but move while you make them.

349
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,640
Hyah, mule!

350
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,920
Did you just call me
a...mule?!

351
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,450
Uh...

352
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,770
mules are ugly.

353
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,160
are you saying
that I, too, am ugly?

354
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,750
What are
these noises?

355
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,800
He called me ugly!

356
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,370
No! "Mule!"
I said "mule."

357
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,890
An old, ugly mule!

358
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,070
And it's true!

359
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,390
Just look at me!

360
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,280
I used to be beautiful.

361
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,070
But -- But now!

362
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,950
No, no, you're still beautiful,
po-- Miss Rarity.

363
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,830
You're just saying that!

364
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,170
No, you're still pretty and --
And --

365
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,010
Oh, nice!
Yeah.

366
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,510
I don't believe you.

367
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,270
You never liked me!

368
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,510
Oh, I've had just about
enough of this.

369
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,640
We're getting close.

370
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,470
I can feel it.

371
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,290
It's coming from down here.
Come on!

372
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,700
She must be
in there.

373
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,530
Let's go!

374
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,630
Aah!
Aah!Aah!
Aah!

375
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,620
More workhorses.

376
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,970
Unh!

377
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,650
Whoa, doggies.

378
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,650
If you can take this bull
by the horns,

379
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,580
You better be ready for a ride.

380
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,370
Come on, ponies!
Kick 'em up, kick 'em out.

381
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.

382
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,340
Aah!

383
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,970
Ooh!

384
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,860
Aah!

385
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,970
Whoa!

386
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,520
Yeehaw!

387
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,490
Get along, little doggies.

388
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,570
I'm coming for you,
my lady!

389
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,320
Heigh-Ho, Twilight!
Away!

390
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,010
And just what do you think
you're doing?

391
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,560
Please, Twilight.
Just give me this.

392
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,250
fine.

393
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,360
Lady Rarity,
I'm here to save you!

394
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,810
Please!
Save us!

395
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,980
Make her stop!

396
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,190
Excuse me?

397
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,470
So picky.
And critical.

398
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,620
She won't
stop talking.

399
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,650
And crying.

400
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,090
We, uh, give her back.
Yes.

401
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,720
Rarity,
you're safe!

402
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,190
Why, yes.
Hello, girls.

403
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,460
You arrived just in time
to assist me.

404
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,210
Uh,
assist you with what?

405
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,780
With those.

406
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,240
You're letting her leave
with all these...jewels?

407
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,300
Yes.

408
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,200
Take them --
And her with them.

409
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,870
Please!

410
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,220
I can't believe
you found all these gems.

411
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,650
I can't believe
you tricked all those dogs.

412
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,400
Just because I'm a lady

413
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,060
Doesn't mean I cannot handle
myself in a sticky situation.

414
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,200
I had them wrapped around
my hoof the entire time.

415
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,320
I can't wait to write
to princess Celestia

416
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,960
To tell her
what you taught me today.

417
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,370
Me?
What did I teach you?

418
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,700
Just because somepony is
ladylike, doesn't make her weak.

419
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,880
In fact, by using her wits,

420
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,550
A seemingly defenseless pony

421
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,290
Can be the one who outsmarts
and outshines them all.

422
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,590
Mmm,
outshines is right.

423
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,080
Now you have enough gems to
cover Sapphire Shores' costumes.

424
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,520
Not if you eat them all,
Spike.
