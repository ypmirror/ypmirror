And you like me so much,

539
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,330
You decided to throw me
a surprise party!

540

That's what we've been trying
to tell you, darling.

You girls are
the best friends ever!

How could I have
ever doubted you?

It's okay, Pinkie Pie.

544
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,670

Don't worry
about it.

547
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,690
I'm just glad I haven't been
replaced by a bucket of turnips.

548
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,190
Huh?
You don't want
to know.

549

All right, girls.
Enough of this gabbin'.

Twilight:
dear princess Celestia,

555
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,870
I am writing to you from
the most delightful party.

556
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,870
I am not only having a great
time with my friends

557
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,730
But also was given
the opportunity

558
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,910
To learn a valuable lesson
about friendship.

559
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,650
Always expect the best
from your friends

560
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,270
And never assume the worst.

561
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,250
Rest assured that a good friend

562
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,410
Always has your best interests
at heart.

You girls wouldn't mind
if we celebrated

Gummy's after-Birthday party,
too, would you?

566

His party was cut short,
and he's pretty upset about it.

Rainbow: oh, sure!
Rarity: oh, definitely.
