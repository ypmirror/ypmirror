1
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:08,195
Quill.

2
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:09,875
Check.

3
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:11,895
Parchment.

4
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:12,625
Check.

5
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:13,455
Extra ink.

6
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:13,975
Check.

7
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,385
Extra-extra ink.

8
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:16,315
Check.

9
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,275
Is that everything on the checklist?

10
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:19,605
-Yep!
-Great.

11
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:22,945
Now that we've completed the checklist
of things we need to create a checklist...

12
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:26,405
...we can make my checklist of the things
I have to get done by the end of the day.

13
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:27,695
Ready?

14
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:28,885
Ready!

15
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:33,255
Item 1: Create checklist of the things
I have to accomplish by the end of the day.

16
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,375
How are we doing, Spike?

17
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:21,765
Let's see...

18
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:23,555
We've already dropped off
your cape at the cleaner's...

19
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:25,555
...returned the blackboard
you borrowed from Cheerilee...

20
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:27,995
...ordered new parchment and quills
from the stationery shop...

21
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,485
Hmm... Seems like we just placed
an order for those a few days ago.

22
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,575
Can imagine why we go
through so many of them.

23
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,635
Sounds like we're ahead
of schedule. What's next?

24
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:40,635
Cupcakes!

25
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:46,935
Uh, I only ordered twelve.

26
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,365
Oh, I know, dear.

27
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:51,975
But I had an extra, so I though
I'd make it a baker's dozen.

28
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:55,785
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.

29
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:58,305
It's just some of the icing
from the extra cupcake...

30
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:01,195
...is getting all over
the one next to it. See?

31
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,595
Oh! Sure.

32
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,955
It's just that I'm planning on
sharing these at a picnic later...

33
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:10,515
...and I don't want anypony to feel like
somepony else is getting more icing.

34
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:14,215
Oh... no, of course not.

35
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:15,835
Not to worry.

36
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,065
I'll just move some of this one to...

37
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:21,405
Hmm... I think I may have
scooped too much.

38
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,675
Oops! Now those two have more.

39
00:02:23,905 --> 00:02:25,605
Let's just try this again.

40
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:30,165
Hmm... No, that won't do.

41
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:33,485
Let me just... hmm...
put some here, then...

42
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:37,825
No, that's not right. A little more
on this one, a little bit... wait...

43
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:42,495
I'll just... Ooh, a little bit
here... here... and...

44
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:43,715
Perfect!

45
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:47,215
Hmm, oh yes. Much better.

46
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:50,005
Okay! Time to tackle
the next item on our...

47
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:51,125
Oops!

48
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,005
Looks like we're gonna have to add
"Give a baby dragon a bath" to our list.

49
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:02,445
Very efficient! And a little bit gross.

50
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:05,275
Looks like that's everything.

51
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,185
Almost everything.

52
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:10,705
"Triple-check checklist to make sure
we didn't miss anything..."

53
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:13,125
"...when the double-checked
the checklist".

54
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,825
Uh, check.

55
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:20,155
I've been holding that quill so long
I've got a claw cramp.

56
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:24,655
Good thing we don't have anything
to report to Princess Celestia this week.

57
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,685
I don't think I can write another word.

58
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:29,775
We haven't sent a letter
to Princess Celestia this week?!

59
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,385
Why? Is that bad?

60
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:33,725
Bad?! BAD?! Of course it's bad!

61
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:36,335
I'm supposed to send Princess
Celestia a letter every week...

62
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:38,445
...telling her about a lesson
I've learned about friendship!

63
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:40,825
Not every other week.
Not every ten days.

64
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,155
Every! Single! Week!

65
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:47,025
Where's my calendar?!
Where's my calendar?!

66
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:49,425
Where it always is?

67
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:52,305
When did we send the last one?

68
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,545
Last Tuesday?

69
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,875
And today is...

70
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,385
Tuesday?

71
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:01,345
Nonononononono...

72
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:05,335
If I don't send her a letter
by sundown, I'll be...

73
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,205
TARDY!!!

74
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,285
What's that now?

75
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:13,315
Tar-dy, Spike. Late! I'll be late!

76
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:17,125
Oh, how could I've let this happen?
I'm usually so organized.

77
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,115
I've never been late for an assignment.

78
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:21,975
Oh, please! You're the most
studious student ever.

79
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:25,415
I'm sure the princess will forgive you
if you miss one little deadline.

80
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,515
I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike.

81
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:30,585
This is the ruler of all of Equestria
we're talking about.

82
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:33,045
The pony who holds
my fate in her hooves.

83
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,605
What if she doesn't forgive me?

84
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:37,355
Yeah, I don't think she...

85
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:38,735
What if instead she starts thinking...

86
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:41,385
...I'm not taking my studies
on friendship seriously?

87
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:42,025
Why would she...

88
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:44,655
What if she makes me come back to
Canterlot and puts me back in school...

89
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:48,305
...and makes me *prove* I've been
taking them seriously by giving me a task?

90
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,225
What if I don't pass?!

91
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:53,115
-But why wouldn't you pass...
-She's my teacher!

92
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:56,195
Do you know what teachers do
to students who don't pass?

93
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:59,425
THEY SEND THEM BACK A GRADE!

94
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:01,065
But she won't just send me back a grade.

95
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:02,805
She'll send me back to...

96
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:05,385
...magic kindergarten.

97
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,515
Twilight.

98
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:15,575
Twilight!

99
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:19,045
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

100
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:21,995
You're not gonna be sent back
to magic kindergarten.

101
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:25,015
You're right. I have no reason to worry.

102
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,315
Because I'm going to solve
a friend's problem...

103
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:30,915
...and get that letter to Princess
Celestia before sundown!

104
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:33,125
So...

105
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:35,485
Got any problems, troubles, conundrums
or any other sort of issues...

106
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:39,085
...major or minor, that I as a good
friend could help you solve?

107
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:45,885
I got nothin'.

108
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:51,115
Then it looks like I'm gonna have to
find somepony who does.

109
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:54,605
This won't end well.

110
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:00,555
You've got this, Twilight.

111
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:04,015
You still have plenty of time to
get that letter to Princess Celestia.

112
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:07,695
Has to be somepony around here
who needs the help of a good friend.

113
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:10,375
Rarity!

114
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,935
Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!

115
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,535
Why me?

116
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:22,515
WHY, WHY, WHY?!

117
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,995
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

118
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:29,005
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

119
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:33,005
What's happened?! Are you all right?

120
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:36,995
I've lost my diamond
encrusted purple ribbon!

121
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:39,685
I have searched HIGH!
And I have searched low.

122
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,395
LOW AND HIGH!
High and low.

123
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,945
But I can't find it anywhere!

124
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,995
ANYWHERE!

125
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:51,845
How can I possibly finish
my latest creation if I can't find it?

126
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,675
Never fear, Rarity. As your friend
I'll do my best to help you fi...

127
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:57,055
Oh, there it is.

128
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:59,925
Isn't it always just
the last place you look.

129
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:04,845
So you just lost your ribbon...

130
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,645
...but now you've found it.

131
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:09,635
Yeah.

132
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:12,115
And nothing else is bothering you?

133
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:15,745
Nothing that I as a good friend
could help you with?

134
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,595
There is one thing.

135
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,995
YES?!

136
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:23,305
I think I've left my measuring tape
under the fabric over there.

137
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:24,975
Could you get that for me?

138
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:29,795
Measuring tape. Sure.

139
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,685
Twilight. Is there something bother...

140
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:34,835
Twilight.

141
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:41,945
No need to panic.
Rarity is just one pony.

142
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:44,325
I'm sure one of my other
friends will need me.

143
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:04,145
What in the world...

144
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:07,595
Rainbow must be angry with Applejack!

145
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:11,055
She must hate her guts. Oh, wonderful!

146
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:13,835
Rainbow Dash! Stop!

147
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:19,405
Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset
with Applejack, but don't worry.

148
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:21,605
Whatever it is that has
come between you two...

149
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:26,405
...I'm sure that I as a good friend
can help you resolve your problems.

150
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:29,935
Uh, what are you talking about?

151
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,835
Oh, Rainbow Dash.

152
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,985
You don't have to hide
your feelings from me.

153
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:36,815
I can tell you two must
have had a terrible fight.

154
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:41,675
Now, why don't you tell me all
about your issues with Applejack?

155
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:43,865
I don't have any issues with Applejack.

156
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:47,355
You don't? Then why are you
destroying her property?

157
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:48,885
Because she asked me to.

158
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,255
Right, Applejack?

159
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:51,445
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:54,975
I wanted to put up a new barn, but
this one's gotta come down first.

161
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:56,915
Now get back to it, RD.

162
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:59,085
You got it, boss!

163
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,205
I'd take cover if I were you.

164
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,645
I can't believe I've
wasted all that time.

165
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,475
I should have just come here first.

166
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:34,265
Fluttershy always has some fear
she's trying to get over.

167
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:37,385
As a good friend
I'll be able to help her.

168
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:50,715
Fluttershy?!

169
00:09:58,445 --> 00:09:59,935
How can this be happening?!

170
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:03,465
Of all the days she had to stop being such
a scaredy-pony she had to pick today?!

171
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:05,745
What am I going to do?

172
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,955
You really should have
come to me sooner.

173
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:12,455
You were carrying so much
tension in that shoulder.

174
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:20,275
It's fine. It'll all be fine.
Today isn't over yet.

175
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,825
But it will be over soon!

176
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:28,125
It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville,
my advanced studies...

177
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,465
No, no. You're a good student.
You can do this.

178
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,735
Oh! But what if I can't?

179
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,855
You can! You just
have to keep it together.

180
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:37,615
Keep! It! Together!

181
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,915
Are you talking to... yourself?

182
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:43,165
Twilight?

183
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:53,535
SNAP OUT OF IT!

184
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:55,085
Huh?

185
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:56,795
Are you okay?

186
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:01,835
Twilight, I'm really worried.

187
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:04,125
I mean this letter thing
is really getting to you.

188
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:04,965
Here.

189
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:08,265
You've been so anxious all day that
you've completely forgot about the picnic.

190
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:10,555
Why don't you just relax
and go hang out with...

191
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:11,645
The picnic!

192
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:14,575
I should go see my friends!

193
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,895
I'm glad you've come to your senses.

194
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:28,605
Please tell me I did not forget the plates.

195
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,825
I did! I totally forgot them!

196
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:33,915
Of all the worst things
that could happen, this is...

197
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:37,275
The! Worst! Possible! Thing!

198
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:42,035
Why, why, why!

199
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:45,115
What?

200
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,765
You didn't expect me to
lay on the grass, did you?

201
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:57,745
You all right, hun?

202
00:11:57,745 --> 00:11:58,415
NO!

203
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:00,125
I am not all right.

204
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,325
It's just terrible.

205
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:05,795
Yes?

206
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,375
Simply awful.

207
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:08,875
Yes?

208
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,645
It's the most terrific trouble
I've ever been in...

209
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:13,605
...and I really, really,
really need your help!

210
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:15,255
YES?

211
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:18,305
My letter to Princess Celestia
is almost overdue.

212
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,275
And I haven't learned
anything about friendship!

213
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:26,475
Oh, thank goodness. I thought
something really awful had happened.

214
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:30,995
Something awful HAS happened!

215
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:35,195
If I don't turn in the letter
on time, I'll be tardy!

216
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,455
TAAARDY!

217
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,125
No offense, sugar cube...

218
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,665
...but it looks like somepony's gettin'
themselves all worked up over nothin'.

219
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,775
This is not nothing.
This is everything!

220
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:53,465
I need you guys to help me find somepony
with a problem I can fix before sundown.

221
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:56,105
MY WHOLE LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!

222
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,655
Oh, Twilight. You're such a crackup.

223
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,245
Come on, now.

224
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,545
Have a seat and stop
sweatin' small stuff.

225
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,685
Wow. I've never seen
Twilight so upset before.

226
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:14,525
Ugh, what a drama queen.

227
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,755
Relatively speaking.

228
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,215
Clock is ticking, Twilight.

229
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,635
Clock... is... ticking!

230
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,505
Keep it together.

231
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,815
If I can't find a friendship problem...

232
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:34,705
...I'll *make* a friendship problem!

233
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:55,175
Hai, gurls!

234
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:58,405
Oh. Hi, Twilight. How's it goi..

235
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,685
Guh-reat! Just great!

236
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:03,085
You three look like
you're doing great too!

237
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:04,775
Looks like three good
friends who obviously...

238
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:07,905
...don't need the help
of another good friend!

239
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:11,545
This is Smarty Pants.

240
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,375
She was mine when I was your age.

241
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,775
And now I want to give her to you!

242
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:20,065
Uh... She's... great!

243
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:22,615
Yeah... Great.

244
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:26,825
I really like her... mane?

245
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,345
She even comes with
her own notebook and quill.

246
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:33,635
For when you want to pretend
she's doing her homework.

247
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:37,435
That's, um... great.

248
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:40,125
Yeah... Great.

249
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:44,935
I really like her... mane?

250
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:47,455
I just hope the fact that
there are three of you...

251
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:50,215
...and only one of her
doesn't become a problem.

252
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:53,635
I'd hate to cause a rift
between such good friends!

253
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:56,545
So who wants to play with her first?

254
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,475
Uh... You should play
with her first, Sweetie Belle.

255
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:01,835
You know, cause you
like her mane so much.

256
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:03,555
Nononononono.

257
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:06,865
I think Scootaloo should
get to play with her first.

258
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,025
I'd love to, but, um...
You take her, Apple Bloom.

259
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:13,585
Applejack says it's important to share.

260
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:17,135
I got to think of something.
Thinkthinkthink, Twilight, think!

261
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:18,955
That's it!

262
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:22,115
Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants.

263
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:24,745
And you're going to like her
more than anything.

264
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:35,025
I want it.

265
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,955
I need it.

266
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:39,215
I really like her mane!

267
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:44,685
The "want it, need it" spell.
Works every time.

268
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:47,155
Okay, okay. Let's break it up.

269
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,695
I think you can all see that
there is an important lesson...

270
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,165
...to be learned here about...

271
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:55,245
Come on, girls. We're all friends here, right?

272
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:56,985
Don't you think you have to share?

273
00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:59,065
No way!

274
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:08,045
Big McIntosh! Thank goodness!

275
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:10,985
You gotta help me get that
doll away from those girls.

276
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:12,895
Eeyup.

277
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:23,675
Thank you so much. Now if
you could just give her to me...

278
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:25,555
Nnnope.

279
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:27,935
Oh no!

280
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:33,925
What's all the commotion about?

281
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,525
They're fighting over that doll!

282
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,455
That incredible, amazing doll!

283
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:43,195
Can't get a clear shot...

284
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,165
Give me!

285
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:54,875
Nnnope.

286
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,265
Oh, what have I done?!

287
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,175
Y'all hear that?

288
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:12,725
What in the name of all things
oats 'n apples is goin' on here?

289
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:22,865
-DON'T LOOK AT IT!
-Don't look at what?

290
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,355
My Smarty Pants doll.

291
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:27,445
I enchanted her and now
everypony is fighting over her.

292
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:30,325
Why would you enchant your doll?

293
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:31,705
Oh, I had to do something!

294
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:33,915
I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia.

295
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:37,275
I thought if I couldn't find
a problem, I'd make a problem.

296
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:39,205
The day is almost over!

297
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:41,005
Not almost.

298
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:49,175
Twilight Sparkle!

299
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:53,945
Whoa, Nelly.

300
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,105
Meet me in the library.

301
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:31,315
Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit...

302
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:35,855
...I'll be in magic kindergarten
back in Canterlot.

303
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:40,495
-Magic kindergarten?
-Canterlot?

304
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,835
We're never gonna see Twilight again!

305
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:46,225
What are we gonna do, y'all?

306
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,975
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

307
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:53,235
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

308
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:59,835
What? I really mean it this time.

309
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:05,475
But... But... I'm supposed to send you
a letter about friendship every week.

310
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,005
I missed the deadline.

311
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,695
I'm a bad student. I'm tardy!

312
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:13,395
You are a wonderful student, Twilight.

313
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:16,205
I don't have to get a letter
every week to know that.

314
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:17,615
Really?

315
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:20,955
WAIT!

316
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:22,275
You can't punish her!

317
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,675
It wasn't her fault!

318
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:24,885
I'm listening.

319
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:27,625
Please, your highness.
We all saw that Twilight was upset.

320
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,785
But we thought that the thing
she was worrying about...

321
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,655
...wasn't worth worrying about.

322
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:33,545
So when she ran out all worked up...

323
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,795
...not a single one of us
tried to stop her.

324
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:38,345
As Twilight's good friends,
we should have taken...

325
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,015
...her feelings seriously
and been there for her.

326
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:42,825
Please don't take her away from us...

327
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:45,635
...just because we were
too insensitive to help her.

328
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:51,435
Looks like you all learned
a pretty valuable lesson today.

329
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:58,675
Very well. I'll forget Twilight's
punishment on one condition.

330
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,425
From this day forth
I would like you all...

331
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:06,585
...to report to me your findings
on the magic of friendship.

332
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:09,635
When and only when you happen to discover them.

333
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,645
Princess Celestia! Wait!

334
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,665
How did you know I was in trouble?

335
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:19,285
Your friend Spike made me aware...

336
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,665
...that you were letting
your fears get the best of you.

337
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:24,735
I commend him for taking
your feelings seriously.

338
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:28,605
Now, if you will all excuse me,
I must return to Canterlot.

339
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:31,055
I'm expecting some mail.

340
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:38,635
Y'all heard the princess.
Spike, take a letter.

341
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:47,675
"Dear Princess Celestia.
We're writin' to you..."

342
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:50,595
"...because today we all learned
a little somethin' about friendship."

343
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:53,795
"We learned that you should take
your friends' worries seriously."

344
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,835
"Even if you don't think that
she has anything to worry about."

345
00:20:56,835 --> 00:21:00,075
"And that you shouldn't let
your worries turn a small problem..."

346
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:03,335
"...into an enormously huge
entire-town-in-total-chaos..."

347
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,055
"...Princess-has-to-come-
-and-save-the-day problem."

348
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,895
"Signed, your loyal subjects."

349
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,255
"PS. Obviously Spike did not
have to learn a lesson..."

350
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:16,655
"...because he is the best, most
awesome friend a pony could ask for."

351
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:20,045
"Unlike everypony else,
he took things seriously. And..."

352
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:23,885
Uh... Yeah.

353
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:25,475
I'll just, um...

354
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,025
