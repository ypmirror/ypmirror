1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,110
Oh, Opalescence,
can't you just picture it?

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,080
Moi stepping out
in a stunning new gown

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,040
at the Grand Galloping Gala
in Canterlot.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,000
Meow!

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,580
Why, yes, I did make it myself.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,800
Thank you so much
for asking.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,010
Oh, oh, well, of course
you can help me.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,100
Thank you.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,430
Meow!

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,980
What's that?
You want to help me more?

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,060
Oh, aren't you
the sweetest thing?

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,320
Meow!

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,940
Careful now.
Don't move.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,110
This shouldn't take long
at all.

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,240
* My Little Pony

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,120
* My Little Pony

17

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,130
* My Little Pony

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,710
* I used to wonder
What friendship could be *

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,170
* My Little Pony

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,010
* Until you all shared
This magic with me *

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,010
* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

23
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,180
* A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong *

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,850
* Sharing kindness
* It's an easy feat

25
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,100
* And magic
Makes it all complete *

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,600
* Yeah, My Little Pony

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
* Do you know you're all
My very best friends? *

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,740
Howdy, Rarity.

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,910
Shh!

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,290
Can't you see Rarity's
trying to concentrate?

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,420
What do you think
she's making?

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,710
Looks like a dress.

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,380
Well, that makes sense,

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,300
since this is
a dressmaker's shop and all.

35
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,550
Is there something
I can help you with?

36
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,260
Oh, so very sorry
to trouble you, Rarity,

37
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,890
but I need
a quick favor.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
Could you please fix
a button for me?

39
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,940
It's my dress
for the Grand Galloping Gala.

40
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,810
Oh, no, no, no!

41
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,490
You can't wear this --
ugh -- old thing.

42
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,780
You need a glamorous new outfit
for the gala.

43
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,740
And I'll make it for you,
no problem at all.

44
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,780
It would be my pleasure.

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,240
Oh, that's really sweet of you
to offer, Rarity,

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,250
but I can't let you
do that.

47
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,710
It would be so much work.

48
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,960
This dress is fine.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,830
Twilight Sparkle,

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,250
I insist on making you
a new dress.

51
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,670
But --
Not another word.

52
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,880
I won't take "no"
for an answer.

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,180
Well...in that case,

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,510
thank you
for your generosity, Rarity.

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,100
Knowing your handiwork,

56
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm sure it will be
absolutely beautiful.

57
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,600
Let me guess, Applejack --

58
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,770
You don't want
a new gown, either.

59
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,690
Gown? Shoot.

60
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,360
I was just gonna wear
my old work duds.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,900
You can't possibly be serious,
Applejack!

62
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,530
You absolutely must wear
formal attire.

63
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,570
Hmm...

64
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,530
nah.

65
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,000
What if I just spruce up
your, uh...duds

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,870
for you a little bit?

67
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,500
Oh, okay.
Sure. Why not?

68
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,420
Since you're offering
and all.

69
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,710
Just don't make them too,
uh, froufrou-y.

70
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,710
Deal!

71
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,380
Look out below!

72
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,470
Aah!

73
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,970
Sorry. New trick.

74
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,600
Didn't quite work.

75
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,930
Hmm.

76
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,940
Idea!

77
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,520
I'll make you an outfit
for the gala, too, Rainbow Dash!

78
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,980
Outfit for the what now?

79
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,450
I'll make one for you and you
and all of you.

80
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,910
Ooh! And, of course,
Pinkie and Fluttershy, too.

81
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,330
Oh, and when I'm done,

82
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,370
we can hold
our very own fashion show!

83
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,490
What a great idea --

84
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,580
If you're sure
you can handle it.

85
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,870
Oh, it'll be
a little bit of work,

86
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,540
but it'll be a wonderful boost
for my business...plus fun!

87
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,590
Oh, I love fun things!

88
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,010
Then it's settled.

89
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,340
We'll have a fashion show
starring us!

90
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,600
Yay!
Yay!Yay!
Yay!

91
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,430
So, all you have to do

92
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,190
is make a different, stunning,
original, amazing outfit

93
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,730
for one, two, three,
four, five --

94
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,860
plus yourself -- six ponies,
and lickety-split?

95
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,980
Oh, Applejack.

96
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,610
You make it sound
as if it's going to be hard.

97
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,080
* Thread by thread

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,790
* Stitching it together

99
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,460
* Twilight's dress

100
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,540
* Cutting out the pattern
Snip by snip *

101
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,670
* Making sure
The fabric falls nicely *

102
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,710
* It's a perfect color
And so hip *

103
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,710
* Always got to keep in mind
My pacing *

104
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,930
* Making sure the clothes
Correctly facing *

105
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,390
* I'm stitching
Twilight's dress *

106
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,930
* Yard by yard

107
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,560
* Fussing on the details

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,980
* Jewel neckline

109
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,150
* Don't you know
A stitch in time saves nine? *

110
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,440
* Make her something perfect
To inspire *

111
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,530
* Even though
She hates formal attire *

112
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,610
* Got to mind
Those intimate details *

113
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,660
* Even though she's
More concerned with sales *

114
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,160
* It's Applejack's new dress

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
* Dressmaking's easy

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,460
* For Pinkie Pie,
Something pink *

117
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,000
* Fluttershy, something breezy

118
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,460
* Blend color and form

119
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,960
* Do you think
It looks cheesy? *

120
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,090
* Something brash

121
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,720
* Perhaps quite fetching

122
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,180
* Hook and eye

123
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,600
* Couldn't you
Just simply die? *

124
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,560
* Making sure it fits
For lock and crest *

125
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
* Don't forget some magic
In the dress *

126
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,650
* Even though it rides high
On the flank *

127
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,730
* Rainbow won't look
Like a tank *

128
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:39,490
* I'm stitching
Rainbow's dress *

129
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,700
* Piece by piece,
Snip by snip *

130
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,870
* Croup, dock, haunch,
Shoulders, hips *

131
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,870
* Thread by thread,
Primmed and pressed *

132
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,960
* Yard by yard,
Never stressed *

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,800
* And that's the art
Of the dre-e-e-e-ss *

134
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,220
That's it.

135
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,600
Keep them closed.

136
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,180
Don't look.

137
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,470
Okay, you can look now!

138
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,850
These are your new outfits.

139
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,480
What do you think of your
old duds now, Applejack?

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,730
Pretty swanky, are they not?

141
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,030
And, Twilight, I made this dress
for you,

142
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,860
and I designed each outfit theme

143
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,490
to perfectly look like
each pony's unique personality.

144
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,040
Oh!
It took me forever

145
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,950
to get the colors right on this
one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,250
Oh, and it turned out beautiful,
don't you think?

147
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,750
And I know you're going
to love yours, Fluttershy.

148
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,960
It just sings spring!

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,590
And, Pinkie Pie, look -- Pink!

150
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,840
Your favorite!

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,640
Aren't they all amazing?!

152
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,980
Wow!

153
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,980
They're...

154
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,600
Yeah, they're...

155
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,900
They sure are,
uh, something.

156
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,530
Yes! Something.

157
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,860
I love something.

158
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,650
Something is my favorite.

159
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,660
It's...nice.

160
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,870
Well, what's the matter?
Don't you like them?

161
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,080
They're very nice.

162
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,790
And we're plumb grateful 'cause
you worked so hard on them.

163
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,540
Mine's just not as cool
as I was imagining.

164
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,750
She asked.

165
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,750
I guess
what we're all saying

166
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,260
is that they're just not
what we had in mind.

167
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,760
Yeah.
Yeah!
Uh-huh.

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,010
That's okay.

169
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,550
Not a problem.

170
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,140
There's plenty more
where that came from.

171
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,970
They were only a first pass.

172
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,560
You're my friends, and I want
you to be 110% satisfied.

173
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,900
Not to worry.

174
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,560
I'll redo them!

175
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,770
Oh, Rarity.
You don't have to do that.

176
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,980
They're fine.

177
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,320
I want them to be better
than just fine.

178
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I want you to think
they're absolutely perfect.

179
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Are you sure?

180
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
I mean,
we wouldn't want to impose.

181
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,830
Oh, it's no imposition.

182
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,620
Really, I insist.

183
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,580
Well, in that case,
thank you again, Rarity.

184
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,260
What have I gotten myself into?

185
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,220
Hello?

186
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,350
You wanted to see me,
Rarity?

187
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,480
Fluttershy!

188
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,100
Your new
new gown's ready.

189
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,310
I completely revised it,

190
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,190
and I know
you're going to love it.

191
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,190
What do you think?

192
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,490
I...love it.

193
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,030
Oh, you're just
saying that.

194
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,780
No, no. I do.

195
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,410
It's...nice.

196
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,830
"Nice"?
Nice.

197
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,000
If you don't like it,
you should just tell me.

198
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,380
Ooh, but I do like it.

199
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,170
Like it or love it?

200
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,340
Um...both?

201
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,460
Which is it?

202
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,220
Uh, please stop
asking me this. I --

203
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,180
Well, just tell me
what you really think.

204
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,340
Uh, no, that's okay.

205
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,390
Tell me!

206
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,050
No.
I-it's fine.

207
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,310
Tell me.

208
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,810
I-I like it.

209
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,140
Tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me, tell me!

210
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,940
All right,
since you really want to know.

211
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,520
The arm size -- tight.

212
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,270
The middy collar doesn't go
with the shawl lapel.

213
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,820
The hands are clearly
machine-stitched.

214
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,360
The pleats are uneven.
The fabric looks like toile.

215
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,450
You used a backstitch here

216
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,990
when it clearly called
for a topstitch

217
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,320
or maybe a traditional
blanket stitch.

218
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,240
And the overdesign
is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter

219
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,160
and not true french
haute couture.

220
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,370
But, uh, you know,

221
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,000
um, whatever you want to do
is fine.

222
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,260
Now, the stars on my belt
need to be technically accurate.

223
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,420
Orion has three stars
on his belt,

224
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,550
Not four.

225
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,090
* Stitch by stitch

226
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,430
* Stitching it together

227
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,060
* Deadline looms

228
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,230
* Don't you know
The client's always right *

229
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,270
* Even if my fabric choice
Was perfect? *

230
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,400
* Got to get them all done
By tonight *

231
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,230
* Pinkie Pie,
The color's too obtrusive *

232
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,480
* Wait until you see it
In the light *

233
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,360
* I'm sewing them together

234
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,450
Don't you think my gown
would be more me

235
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,530
with some lollipops?

236
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,280
Well, I think --
Balloons?

237
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,990
Well...
Do it!

238
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,080
* Hour by hour

239
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,460
* One more change

240
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,130
* I'm sewing them together

241
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,090
* Take great pains

242
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,300
* Fluttershy,
You're putting me in a bind *

243
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,340
* Rainbow Dash,
What is on your mind? *

244
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,840
* Oh, my gosh,
There's simply not much time *

245
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,310
* Don't forget,
Applejack's duds must shine *

246
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,180
* Dressmaking's easy

247
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,190
* Every customer's call

248
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,190
* Brings a whole new revision

249
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,110
* Have to pick up the pace,
Still hold to my vision *

250
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,360
That constellation
is canis major, not minor.

251
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,570
French haute couture,
please.

252
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,530
Eh...

253
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,450
What if it rains?

254
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,410
Galoshes!

255
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,500
More balloons!

256
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, no.
That's too many balloons.

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,130
More candy!
Oh, less candy!

258
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,090
Oh, wait, I know --
Streamers!

259
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,460
Streamers?

260
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,340
Whose dress is this?

261
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,050
Streamers it is.

262
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,390
What?

263
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,970
Aren't you going to tell me
to change something, too?

264
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,230
No. I just want my dress
to be...cool.

265
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,520
Do you not like
the color?

266
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,520
The color's fine.
Just make it look cooler.

267
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,650
Do you not like
the shape?

268
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,650
The shape's fine.

269
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,530
Just make the whole thing,
you know, cooler.

270
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,150
It needs to be
about 20% cooler.

271
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,530
* All we ever want
Is indecision *

272
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,490
* All we really like
Is what we know *

273
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,660
* Got to balance style
With adherence *

274
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,620
* Making sure we make
A good appearance *

275
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,540
* Even if you simply
Have to fudge it *

276
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,670
* Make sure that it stays
Within our budget *

277
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,630
* Got to overcome intimidation

278
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,510
* Remember, it's all
In the presentation *

279
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,510
* Piece by piece,
Snip by snip *

280
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,510
* Croup, dock, haunch,
Shoulders, hip *

281
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,510
* Bolt by bolt,
Primmed and pressed *

282
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,640
* Yard by yard,
Always stressed *

283
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,650
* And that's the art
Of the dre-e-e-e-es *

284
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,650
Oh, Opal.

285
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,240
These are the ugliest dresses
I've ever made.

286
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,660
Okay. I did exactly
what each of you asked for.

287
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,000
Now, don't hold back.

288
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,420
Let me know
what you really think.

289
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,420
Oh, my!
It's...perfect!

290
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,000
It's cool!
Wow.

291
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,380
They're the best duds
I ever did see.

292
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,300
It's exactly
what I asked for!

293
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,510
Thank you, Rarity.

294
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,350
Are you as happy with them
as we are?!

295
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,640
Huh, huh, huh?!

296
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,520
Well, I'm happy
that all of you are happy.

297
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,100
I'm just relieved
to finally be done.

298
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,280
You are never
gonna believe this!

299
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,570
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?

300
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,110
The bigwig fashion hotshot
in Canterlot?

301
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,950
Uh-huh.

302
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,570
He heard
about your fashion show.

303
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,580
Well, maybe I happened
to mention it to him.

304
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,120
He's coming here
all the way from Canterlot

305
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,500
to see your work, Rarity!

306
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,290
Whoa, nelly!

307
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,500
You could sell a ton of dresses
to this guy.

308
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,500
Your business
will be booming!

309
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,460
That's so cool!
I can't believe it!
Amazing!

310
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,090
H-Hoity-Toity?

311
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,130
He's coming here...

312
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,260
to see these dresses?

313
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,180
Yep. Get ready for all
your dreams to come true.

314
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,650
Oh.

315
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,110
There he is.

316
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,790
Okay.
Relax, Rarity.

317
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,090
Your friends like their outfits,
and so will he.

318
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,210
Aaah!

319
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,840
What's wrong with the lights?!
Aah!

320
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,470
Oh, yes.
That means the show's starting.

321
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,470
Good.

322
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,560
Since the beginning of time,

323
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,690
The elite of Equestria
have longed for pony fashions

324
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,700
that truly express the essence
of their very souls...

325
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,780
Patiently waiting decades --
no, centuries --

326
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,450
for the perfect pony gown.

327
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,410
Today, at long last, Equestria,

328
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,830
your wait is over.

329
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,580
Let's hear it
for the breathtaking designs

330
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,420
of Ponyville's own Rarity!

331
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Blech!

332
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,400
Why is everypony
looking at us like that?

333
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,280
Oh, dear.

334
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,700
Y-you think
we overdid it?

335
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,200
Nah.

336
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,540
Okay.
Maybe a little.

337
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,460
Oh, those amateurish designs
look like a piled-on mishmash

338
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,460
of everything
but the kitchen sink.

339
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,260
It's a travesty,
is what it is.

340
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,260
Those outfits are the ugliest
things I've ever seen!

341
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,430
Oh, for shame.

342
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,600
Who is responsible

343
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,390
for subjecting our eyes
to these horrors?!

344
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,900
Not to mention wasting
my valuable time?

345
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,520
Oh! Hide me.

346
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,480
Come on out and take a bow,
Rarity.

347
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,360
You worked really hard
for this.

348
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,700
Yes! All right!
Hoo-hoo! Go, Rarity!

349
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,840
Rarity,
you okay in there?

350
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
You haven't come out
for days.

351
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,880
I'm never coming out!

352
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,840
I can't show my face
in Ponyville ever again!

353
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,300
I used to be somepony.

354
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,010
I used to be respected.

355
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,180
I made dresses --
beautiful, beautiful dresses.

356
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,190
But now everypony
is laughing at me.

357
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!

358
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,110
You're not
a laughingstock, Rarity.

359
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,530
She kind of is.
Shh!

360
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,410
Come on out
and talk to us.

361
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,080
Leave me alone!

362
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
I want to be alone.

363
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I want to wallow in...

364
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,500
Whatever it is that ponies
are supposed to wallow in!

365
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,130
Do ponies wallow in pity?

366
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,460
Oh, listen to me!

367
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to wallow in!

368
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,550
I'm so pathetic!

369
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,390
Now what do we do?

370
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,800
Panic?

371
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,510
That's your answer
for everything.

372
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,850
Well, we can't just
leave Rarity like this.

373
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,100
She'll become
a crazy cat lady!

374
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,390
She only has one cat.

375
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,270
Give her time.

376
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,820
Hmm.

377
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,240
Exile.

378
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,990
I guess, technically,
I'd have to move away

379
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,910
to live in exile.

380
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,160
Where would I go,
and what would I pack?

381
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh, it's gonna take me forever
to do all of that packing.

382
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,500
What are you supposed to pack
when you go into exile?

383
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,080
Are you supposed to pack warm?

384
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,420
Huh? Opal?

385
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,090
Opal, how did you
get up there?

386
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,140
Hang on, you poor dear.
Mama's coming!

387
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,060
Rainbow Dash?!

388
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,230
How dare you strand
my poor Opal in a tree!

389
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,030
Well, how else were we gonna get
you out here to show you this?

390
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,400
What is it?

391
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,950
It's m-- y--

392
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,620
We all finished
your dress for you!

393
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,540
Thanks to Fluttershy's
freaky knowledge of sewing.

394
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,870
Do you like it?

395
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,960
Like it?

396
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,460
Like it?

397
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,050
Uh-oh.
She doesn't like it.

398
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,340
No.
I don't like it.

399
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,260
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

400
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,630
I love it!

401
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,260
Yay!
Yay!Yay!
Yay!

402
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,470
You ponies
did an amazing job!

403
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,100
It's exactly the way
I imagined it.

404
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,100
We just followed
your brilliant design.

405
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,900
Like we should have let you do
for our outfits.

406
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,110
Those first dresses you designed
were perfect.

407
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,490
We're so
supersorry.

408
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,780
You worked really hard

409
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,950
to make our dresses
exactly the way we wanted them,

410
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,330
and we all saw how well
that turned out.

411
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,910
Oh, I forgive you.

412
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,920
Well,
that's mighty big of you.

413
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,340
But my whole career
is still ruined!

414
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,590
Oh. Right. That.

415
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,340
Maybe not.

416
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,510
All right.
I haven't got all day.

417
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,350
Take two.

418
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,040
Hello.

419
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,960
Oh, this can't be
the same designer.

420
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,390
Simply magnificent!

421
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,270
And I suddenly have
a fierce craving

422
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,600
for some dutch apple pie,
candied apples on a stick,

423
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,400
apple turnovers,
apple cobbler...

424
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,750
Brilliant!

425
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,430
Oh! Spectacular!

426
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,490
Now, this is a fashion show!

427
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,280
Oh, these dresses
are absolutely amazing!

428
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,120
Who is responsible?

429
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,540
Step forward. Show yourself!

430
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,420
Brava! Brava!

431
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,470
Magnifico! Encore!

432
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,430
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!

433
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,100
Oh!
Thank you so much!

434
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,310
Dear Princess Celestia,

435
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,140
This week, my very talented
friend Rarity learned

436
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,270
that if you try
to please everypony,

437
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,560
you oftentimes end up
pleasing nopony,

438
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,440
especially yourself.

439
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,360
And I learned this --

440
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,610
when somepony
offers to do you a favor,

441
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,660
like making you
a beautiful dress,

442
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,490
you shouldn't be overly critical

443
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,660
of something
generously given to you.

444
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,580
In other words, you shouldn't
look a gift horse in the mouth.

445
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,260
Rarity,
my congratulations to you

446
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,130
on a most impressive
fashion debut!

447
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,260
Would you do me the great honor
of allowing me

448
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,720
to feature your couture

449
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,480
in my best of the best boutique
in Canterlot?

450
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Now, I'll need you to make
a dozen of each dress for me

451
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,230
by next tuesday.

452
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,610
* My Little Pony

453
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,660
* My Little Pony

454
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,500
* My Little Pony

455
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,550
* Friends
