the wind in my mane!

355
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,320
I liked it a lot!

356
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,880
Whoa!

357
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,860
Ha!
Later, Rainbow crash.

358
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,740
Hey!

359
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,260
Turns out the only thing I liked
more than flying fast...

360
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,210
whoa-Oh-Oh!

361
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,680
...was winning.

362
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,000
Most people thought

363
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,590
That the sonic rainboom
was just an old mare's tail.

364
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,370
But that day,
the day I discovered racing,

365
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,890
I proved
that the legends were true.

366
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,870
I made the impossible happen.

367
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,340
[ Cheers ]

368
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,070
And that, little ones,
is how you earn a cutie mark.

369
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,700
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

370
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,850
Fluttershy:
wait a second.

371
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,660
I heard that explosion,
and I saw the Rainbow, too.

372
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,050
Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't
scared the animals,

373
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,890
I never would have learned
I could communicate with them

374
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,260
And gotten
my cutie mark.

375
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,870
I heard that boom,
and right afterwards,

376
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,070
There was this amazing Rainbow
that taught me to smile.

377
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,690
Applejack:
when I got my cutie mark,

378
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,020
I saw a Rainbow
that pointed me home.

379
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,860
I bet it was
your sonic rainboom.

380
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,150
There was an explosion
I could never explain

381
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,730
When I got my cutie mark.

382
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,070
This is uncanny.

383
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,260
If that explosion didn't happen
when it did,

384
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,120
I would have blown
my entrance exam.

385
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,010
Rainbow Dash, I think you helped
me earn my cutie mark, too!

386
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,620
Whoa!

387
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,450
We all owe
our cutie marks to you!

388
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,460
Do you realize
what this means?

389
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,720
All of us had a special
connection before we even met.

390
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,480
We've been BFFs forever,
and we didn't even know it!

391
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,080
Come here, y'all.

392
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,710
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

393
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,610
I love you guys.

394
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,090
Aww!
Aww!

395
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,610
Ew!
Give me a break.

396
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,730
Come on, crusaders.

397
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,040
Maybe we just need to try
zip-Lining again.

398
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,590
[ Sighs ]

399
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,050
Hey,
how about a song?

400
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,210
Yes!
Definitely!

401
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,860
N-O-O-O-O-O!

402
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,770
Twilight Sparkle:
dear princess Celestia,

403
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,720
Today I learned
something amazing.

404
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,170
Everypony everywhere

405
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,690
Has a special magical connection
with her friends,

406
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,640
Maybe even
before she's met them.

407
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,160
If you're feeling lonely

408
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,300
And you're still searching
for your true friends,

409
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,060
Just look up in the sky.

410
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,970
Who knows? Maybe you
and your future best friends

411
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,690
Are all looking
at the same Rainbow.

412
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,380
Gross.
When did you get so cheesy?

413
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,340
Just write it, Spike.
