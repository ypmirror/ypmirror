1
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:14,715
Here? I get to stay here?

2
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,635
Twilight Sparkle said you were
coming to Canterlot for a visit...

3
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,555
...and asked if
I might accommodate you.

4
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:21,795
Thank you so much, princess.

5
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:23,105
You're very welcome.

6
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:26,225
No, really. This is so nice of you.

7
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:27,775
It's nothing, really.

8
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,755
Oh, but it isn't nothing.
It's everything.

9
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:32,315
I-I just don't know what to say
but thank you, thank you!

10
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,235
Thank you... Thank you...
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

11
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:42,125
-You are very welc...
-Thank you!

12
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:45,715
Your luggage, mademoiselle?

13
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:48,125
I'll leave you to get settled.

14
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,495
Your highness...

15
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:51,765
Enjoy your stay.

16
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:54,905
Thank you!

17
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,555
Where would you like me to put these?

18
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:02,855
That's perfect.

19
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:47,055
Opal, do you know what
I love about Canterlot?

20
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,445
Everything!

21
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,505
I may have been born in Ponyville,
but I am a Canterlot pony at heart.

22
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:59,015
Now I know that we are here
to pick up some fabrics for the shop...

23
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:01,675
...but Twilight was such a dear
to get me that suite at the castle...

24
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:04,955
...I simply must make her something
to express my gratitude.

25
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:07,345
Ooh!

26
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:10,735
An outfit for her birthday party
this weekend! Perfect!

27
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:13,365
Don't you just love it
here, Opalescence?

28
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,155
Please excuse our interruption.

29
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:24,415
I'm Jet Set and this
is my wife, Upper Crust.

30
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:27,935
We saw you from across the café
and just have to find out...

31
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:31,385
Where did you get that
simply marvelous chapeau?

32
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:34,485
Huh, this old thing?
Oh, it's just something I...

33
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:35,895
Rarity!

34
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:38,305
Hey, Rarity!

35
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:44,045
It's me! Hayseed Turnip Truck!

36
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:46,595
We met at the big hoedown
in Ponyville last month.

37
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:50,075
Oh... Yes... Of course. How are you?

38
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,255
Good! Real good!

39
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:57,935
You're from... Ponyville?

40
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,895
Well, ye... yes, but...

41
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:04,255
She sure is! She's a real big time
fancy pants dressmaker there.

42
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:07,105
Probably made that real purty
thing she's got on her head.

43
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:10,305
I thought it looked a little... country.

44
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:14,185
I told you it wasn't something you
could get here in Canterlot, dear.

45
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:20,005
Well, they seemed real nice.

46
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,575
"Looked a little country."

47
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,645
"Not something you could
get in Canterlot."

48
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,615
I'll show you something
worthy of Canterlot!

49
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,905
I have to get started right away.

50
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:44,765
This new design is very ambitious...

51
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:46,495
...and I've already written
to Twilight to let her know...

52
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:49,355
...she'll have something beyond
fabulous to wear to her party.

53
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,345
Fancypants?

54
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:02,235
I say, that's one way
to make the introduction.

55
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:03,245
Oh, goodness!

56
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:07,325
I am so sorry. I didn't see you there.
I've just got so many bags...

57
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:10,235
...and I was trying to get back
to my suite at the castle and...

58
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:12,445
You're staying at the castle?

59
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:15,425
Wh... The princess invited me
to stay in one of the suites.

60
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,695
You know the princess?

61
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,075
Hmm... A pony with
expensive taste, I see.

62
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:24,095
Oh... It's for an ensemble
I'm making for a friend.

63
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,975
Her birthday is in a few days.

64
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:29,305
Again, I am really sorry
I bumped into you.

65
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,125
I'm not.

66
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:34,775
You are obviously somepony
worth bumping into.

67
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,065
Uh, listen. I have a VIP box reserved
at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon.

68
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:41,875
Would you... Would you be so kind...

69
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,115
...as to join me and a few
of my companions there, hmm?

70
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:45,835
Me?

71
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,155
But of course, my dear.

72
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:50,415
Well, I'm... uh... I'm not sure.

73
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,755
We'd love to see you there, uh...

74
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:54,005
Rarity.

75
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,875
...Rarity.

76
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,525
Pro: seeing the derby from a VIP box
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

77
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:06,955
Con: going to the derby cuts
into the amount of time...

78
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,665
...I have to finish Twilight's outfit.

79
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,535
Pro: Fancypants is *the* most
important pony in Canterlot.

80
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:15,185
His stamp of approval could
mean big things for me here.

81
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:18,545
Con: Twilight's party might not be
as sophisticated as a derby...

82
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:20,375
...but that doesn't mean
I shouldn't put all of my energy...

83
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:22,065
...into creating her birthday ensemble.

84
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:25,055
My Ponyville friends will appreciate
my hard work more than anypony.

85
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,475
I hate to let them down.

86
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:32,565
And I won't.

87
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:36,735
Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts
Derby as a guest of Fancypants.

88
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:48,935
Pardon me.. Excuse me... Excuse me...

89
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,725
Rarity! Jolly good to see you!
So glad you could make it.

90
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:11,595
Everypony, this is Rarity.

91
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:14,305
She is staying at Canterlot Castle.

92
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,445
Fillies and gentlecolts!

93
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,885
Welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby!

94
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:24,145
The competitors are taking their
places at the starting line...

95
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:26,995
...and the race will begin momentarily.

96
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,105
I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course.

97
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:31,575
He's sure to take home the grand prize.

98
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,215
I don't think he has
a chance against Fleetfoot.

99
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,765
And it's Fleetfoot by a nose!

100
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:53,575
Bravo, Rarity!

101
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:56,535
I say, how did you know
Fleetfoot would be victorious?

102
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,995
My friend Rainbow Dash
talks about her all the time.

103
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:02,285
She says what Fleetfoot lacks
in size, she makes up for in speed.

104
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:06,055
And who is this Rainbow Dash?

105
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:12,975
Why... she's...

106
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,425
She's the... the Wonderbolts'
trainer, of course.

107
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:22,545
Staying at Canterlot Castle AND she knows
the pegasus training the Wonderbolts!

108
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:25,715
I told you all this was
an important pony.

109
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:33,415
Three cheers for Rarity,
my new favorite party guest.

110
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:39,045
Hip hip, hurray! Hip hip, hurray!
Hip hip, hurray!

111
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:43,215
...and then I said: "Please,
that isn't a hat, darling."

112
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:46,915
"That's a natural disaster, that
somehow landed atop your head!"

113
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:54,475
Oh, you are a delight, Rarity.
An absolute delight.

114
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:58,205
You simply must attend my
art gallery opening this evening.

115
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,855
Oh. I'd love to, but I...

116
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,545
And let's not forget my charity
auction tomorrow morning.

117
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:06,215
That sounds wonderful, but I...

118
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:10,275
And of course there's a seat for you
at my dinner party tomorrow night.

119
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:12,745
I'm flattered. Really.

120
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:15,815
It's just I have a project I really
need to get started on and...

121
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:17,825
Oh, but Rarity!

122
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:22,135
I may as well close down the whole
gallery if you can't attend!

123
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,505
My auction is for charity,
dear. For charity!

124
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,695
And my dinner party will be
a disaster if you don't come.

125
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,845
Of course I'll be there.

126
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,835
-Wonderful!
-Disaster averted.

127
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,715
Looks like we'll be spending a few
more days here, Opalescence.

128
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:44,755
Turns out bumping into
Fancypants like that...

129
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:47,415
...was the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

130
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:49,355
Of course finishing
Twilight's dress in time...

131
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:52,405
...for her birthday party
is still my top priority.

132
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,975
But I can't possibly disappoint
the Canterlot elite...

133
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:58,115
...by rejecting their
invitations, now can I?

134
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:10,295
<i>I'll be the toast of the town,
the girl on the go</i>

135
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:14,315
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

136
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:18,255
<i>I'll be the one to watch,
the girl in the flow</i>

137
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:22,425
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

138
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:26,955
<i>Becoming as popular
as popular can be</i>

139
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:31,565
<i>Making my mark, making my mark
in high society</i>

140
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:36,195
<i>I'm the belle of the ball,
the star of the show, yeah</i>

141
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:40,455
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

142
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:45,455
<i>See how they hang on
every word that I speak</i>

143
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:49,455
<i>My approving glance
is what they all seek</i>

144
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:54,215
<i>I'm the crème de la crème,
not just another Jane Doe</i>

145
00:09:54,215 --> 00:10:00,585
<i>And the type of pony
everypony should know</i>

146
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:04,655
<i>At home, at the opera,
on a fancy yacht</i>

147
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:08,535
<i>Becoming the talk,
the talk of all of Canterlot</i>

148
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:13,305
<i>I'm the crème de la crème,
not just another Jane Doe, yeah</i>

149
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:20,515
<i>And the type of pony
everypony, everypony should know</i>

150
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:27,915
<i>Because I'm the type of pony</i>

151
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:31,585
<i>Yes, I'm the type of pony</i>

152
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:46,705
<i>Yes, I'm the type of pony
everypony should know</i>

153
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,065
Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.

154
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,155
Me... too...

155
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,665
We better get going.
I must get back to Ponyville...

156
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:59,175
...with enough time
to finish Twilight's ensemble.

157
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:02,665
For me?

158
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,925
"Dearest Rarity, your
presence is requested..."

159
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,985
"...at the Canterlot Garden
Party tomorrow afternoon."

160
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:10,325
"Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust."

161
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,345
The Canterlot Garden Party!

162
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:17,105
Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is
*the* premier event of Canterlot!

163
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,705
Ooh. But if I go,
I'll miss Twilight's birthday.

164
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,745
But if I don't go, my new
reputation in Canterlot...

165
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:27,925
...as a Very Important
Pony might be ruined!

166
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:31,555
I might never be invited to another
high society event again!

167
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,785
Friend's birthday – Very Important Pony...

168
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,855
It's just too important.

169
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,765
"My dear Twilight. I am afraid..."

170
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:47,415
"...I won't be able to make it
to your birthday party tomorrow..."

171
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,855
"...because..."

172
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:51,805
Because poor Opal is quite ill!

173
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:56,235
And she is in no condition to make
the long journey back to Ponyville.

174
00:11:56,235 --> 00:12:01,795
"I do hope you understand.
Your friend, Rarity."

175
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:05,015
I suppose this means you don't
need me to bring down your bags?

176
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:05,855
No.

177
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,545
But I will need some
help unpacking them.

178
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:13,985
What do you think? Too much?

179
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,545
You're right. Too little.

180
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:20,465
Garden party, here I come!

181
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:23,015
SURPRISE!

182
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:30,075
And SWOOSH! And right before
she hit the ground, SHOOM, she...

183
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:30,995
Hi again!

184
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:34,065
W-What are you...
How did you... Why are you...

185
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:37,715
Listen to her. She's so excited
to see us, she can hardly talk.

186
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,885
What I mean to say is,
what are you all doing here?

187
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,625
When I got your letter saying
you were stuck in Canterlot...

188
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,115
...I asked Pinkie Pie if it
wouldn't be too much trouble...

189
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:49,155
...to move my birthday party here,
so you wouldn't have to miss it.

190
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:51,025
Balloons are super easy to pack.

191
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:59,385
Wow. First you get me a suite
at Canterlot Castle and now this...

192
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:01,845
I don't know what to say, Twilight.

193
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:05,955
How about you start by saying what
you're doing in that fancy getup.

194
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:08,565
This? Uh.. Well, I...

195
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:13,575
I always put on something a little fancy
when Opal's feeling under the weather.

196
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:14,955
Cheers her right up.

197
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,805
Oh, poor Opal.
Where is the sick darling?

198
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,675
Oh, uh... she's...

199
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,875
Hold on a minute.

200
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,315
I am so sorry about this.

201
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:38,345
She's resting on the bed.

202
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:42,185
Poor baby. She looks awful.

203
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,565
Is that my dress?

204
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:48,055
Yes...

205
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:52,425
It's so simple. So practical.

206
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,065
So... ME!

207
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,635
It's the perfect dress
for my birthday party!

208
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,195
I love it!

209
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:02,595
You don't know how glad
I am to hear you say that.

210
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:09,125
When I told the princess that I was
moving the party to Canterlot...

211
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,865
...she was kind enough to offer us
the Canterlot Castle ballroom.

212
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,195
Isn't it fancy pants?

213
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:17,485
Fancypants!

214
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,755
Where?!

215
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:21,725
I... mean...

216
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:25,225
...where did you find the time
to put up all these decorations?

217
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:30,565
Oh, I never leave home
without my party cannon!

218
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:34,735
Ta-da!

219
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,625
I thought about having
my birthday outside...

220
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:40,835
...but they're having another party
on the castle grounds today.

221
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:51,105
LET'S PARTY!

222
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,675
No reason I can't at least
make an appearance.

223
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:32,515
I'm here!

224
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,495
Darling, I'm so glad you made it.

225
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:38,775
Rarity! So happy to see you here.

226
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:41,445
I wouldn't have missed
this for the world.

227
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:45,395
I say, what is that
scent you're wearing?

228
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:48,735
It smells like...
Is that cake frosting?

229
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:53,515
Yes, I always dab a little frosting
behind my ears before I go out.

230
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,495
After all, who doesn't like
the smell of cake frosting?

231
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:00,865
I know I do.

232
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:05,865
Well, all this talk about cake
has made me hungry.

233
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,385
Think I'll go and see what's
on the hors d'oeuvre table.

234
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,155
If you'll excuse me...

235
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:13,005
-I must say, you do look like a...
-Oh, yes, darling.

236
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:52,585
I think I left the bath water
running in my suite.

237
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,475
I really should go check on Opal.

238
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:57,715
Is that Princess Celestia?

239
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,875
I need to use the little filly's room.

240
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,525
Can I get anypony more punch?

241
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,985
I... have to go to do the...

242
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:06,325
...thing with the... stuff, you know.

243
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,825
Uh... What's with the croquet mallet?

244
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,975
-[What croquet mallet?]
-Duh! The one in your mouth.

245
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,775
Oh, that croquet mallet.

246
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,225
I... well, I... you know,
the truth is... the truth is...

247
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:23,565
Were you at that other
party in the garden?

248
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,325
I... I... I...

249
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:29,075
Rarity, I'm surprised at you.

250
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:30,995
Twilight, let me explain! I...

251
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:33,725
I hadn't realized you were
such a savvy businesspony.

252
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:36,015
You must understand! I...

253
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:38,245
All of those ponies look so posh.

254
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:40,495
And with the Grand
Galloping Gala coming up...

255
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:43,325
...I bet you could totally get
some of them to buy your dresses.

256
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:45,145
Very smart.

257
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:48,715
Wh... wwwhyyy, yes! Uh...

258
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,285
I didn't want you to think
I was being rude...

259
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:53,925
...so that's exactly
the reason I didn't tell you.

260
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:56,065
The one and only reason.

261
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:59,485
Oh, well. You didn't have to do that.

262
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:01,755
You should totally go
over there and mingle.

263
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:06,665
Twilight, you really are the best
friend a pony could ever ask for.

264
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,245
I don't know why I ever thought
you wouldn't understand.

265
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:11,425
Understand what?

266
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:12,505
Nothing!

267
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:13,805
See you girls later!

268
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,285
Hey, wait up!

269
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:19,925
We're your friends. I'm sure they won't
mind if we check out the party too.

270
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:24,205
Come on, you guys! Let's show 'em
how to party Ponyville style!

271
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,415
Oh no!

272
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:56,705
How come y'all aren't
doin' any gardenin'?

273
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:59,115
This is a garden party, isn't it?

274
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:07,935
Can you believe what
that pony is wearing?

275
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:09,465
It's just so plain.

276
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:11,375
Yeah...

277
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:17,225
Excuse me. Might I ask where
you got you ensemble?

278
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:19,225
Why, yes. Yes, you may.

279
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:23,215
A very, very close friend of mine
from Ponyville made it for me.

280
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,825
Ponyville? You don't say.

281
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,075
I do say. Her name is...

282
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:32,475
Fancypants! Come with me.

283
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:35,315
I'd like to show you...
this thing that's over there.

284
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:36,685
On the other side of the room.

285
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:38,295
In a moment, my dear.

286
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:41,945
This lovely filly from Ponyville
was just about to tell me...

287
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,675
...who made her charming dress.

288
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:47,085
That dress? Oh, come now.
Who cares? It's just a plain old...

289
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,685
Oh, don't be so modest.

290
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:50,845
This dress you made is beautiful.

291
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:57,495
We all think so.

292
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,335
You know these ponies?

293
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:15,455
Yes. Yes, I do know them.

294
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:18,895
They may not be as sophisticated
as some of you Canterlot ponies...

295
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:22,305
...but they are my best friends
and they are without a doubt...

296
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:25,105
...the most important ponies I know.

297
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:29,265
"Important ponies"? These ruffians?

298
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:31,645
Don't make me laugh.

299
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:36,775
I, for one, find them charmingly rustic.

300
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:41,155
And I think the dress you made
for your friend is lovely.

301
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:45,325
I dare say every mare
in Canterlot will be wanting one.

302
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,475
Oh, I'd like to place my order right now.

303
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,605
I think you should get two, hmm?

304
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,245
Uh, yes. Now then...

305
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:56,605
How about you introduce me
to your friends?

306
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:58,485
With pleasure.

307
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,855
"Dear Princess Celestia."

308
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:06,305
"I wanted to tell you about the important
lesson I learned during my visit."

309
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:08,675
Now that I would like to hear.

310
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:11,595
I learned that no matter
where you go in life...

311
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:15,415
...you should never forget that you are
the product of your home and your friends.

312
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:19,305
And that is something always
to be proud of, no matter what.

313
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:23,165
A very valuable lesson to have learned.

314
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,495
It certainly is...

315
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:28,175
...but might I ask that
we hurry things up a bit?

316
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,125
Oooh nooo!

317
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:36,835
