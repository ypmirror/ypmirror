1
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,460
Let's quiet down, please.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,830
We have a very important lesson
to get to.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,010
Today, we are going to be
talking about cutie marks.

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,630
Boring.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,840
You can all see my cutie mark,
can't you?

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,850
Like all ponies,
I wasn't born with a cutie mark.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,980
My flank was blank.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,520
Aww...

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,650
She's so precious.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,860
Then one day
when I was about your age,

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,440
I woke up to find
that a cutie mark had appeared.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,110
Look at her hair!

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,030
Yes, I know, but, honestly,

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,870
that's how everypony was wearing
their mane back then.

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,040
I had decided to become
a teacher,

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,080
and the flowers
symbolize my hope

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,630
That I could help
my future students bloom

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,920
if I nurtured them
with knowledge.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,550
The smiles represented
the cheer I hoped to bring

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,800
to my little ponies
while they were learning.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,640
Now, can anyone tell me when a
pony gets his or her cutie mark?

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,180
Oh! Oh! Oh!

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,970
When she discovers
that certain something

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,640
that makes her special.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,140
That's right, twist.

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,940
A cutie mark
appears on a pony's flank

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,690
when he or she finds
that certain something

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,110
that makes them different
from every other pony.

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,070
Discovering
what makes you unique

31
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,570
isn't something
that happens overnight.

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,200
Psst!

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,990
And no amount of hoping,
wishing, or begging...
psst!

34
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,620
...will make a cutie mark appear
before its time.

35
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,580
Psst!

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,000
What?!

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,000
Apple Bloom!

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,630
Are you passing a note?

39
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,840
Uh...um...

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,180
What could be so important

41
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,260
that it couldn't wait
until after class?

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,850
It's blank.

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Remind you
of anypony?

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,320
* My Little Pony

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,200
* My Little Pony

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,200
* My Little Pony

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,700
* I used to wonder
What friendship could be *

49
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,200
* My Little Pony

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
* Until you all shared
Its magic with me *

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,080
* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

52
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,210
* A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong *

53
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,880
* Sharing kindness
* It's an easy feat

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,130
* And magic
Makes it all complete *

55
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,630
* Yeah, My Little Pony

56
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,640
* Do you know you're all
My very best friends? *

57
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,110
Want something sweet?

58
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,530
I've got
some peppermint sticks.

59
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,700
I made them myself.

60
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,410
Mnh-Mnh.

61
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,710
They'll make you smile.

62
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,370
No.

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
I don't know why we had to
sit through a lecture

64
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,290
about getting a cutie mark.

65
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,090
I mean, waiting
for your cutie mark

66
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,210
is so last week.

67
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,550
You've got yours.

68
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,840
I just got mine.

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,510
We all have them already.

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,100
I mean, almost all of us
have them already.

71
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,310
Don't worry, you two,

72
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,520
You're still totally invited
to my cute-ceañera this weekend.

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,600
It's going to be
amazing.

74
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,570
It's a party celebrating me
and my fantastic cutie mark.

75
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,650
How can it not be?

76
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,240
Bump, bump,

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,530
sugar lump, rump!

78
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,370
Give me a break.

79
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,410
See you
this weekend...

80
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,210
...blank flanks!

81
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,210
It's not fair!

82
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,840
It's just not fair!

83
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,220
Don't get your mane
in a tangle.

84
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,760
You'll get your cutie mark.

85
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,890
Everypony gets one
eventually.

86
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,640
But I don't want one
eventually.

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,390
I want one right now!

88
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,390
I can't go to Diamond Tiara's
cute-ceañera without one.

89
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,810
I just can't!

90
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,060
'Course you can.

91
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,900
You know, I was the last pony
in my class to get a cutie mark,

92
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,190
and I couldn't be prouder
of it.

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,570
I knew my future
was to run Sweet Apple Acres,

94
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,200
and these bright, shiny apples
sealed the deal.

95
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Come to think of it,

96
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,750
Granny Smith was the last one
in her class, too.

97
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,790
Huh.
Same with Big Mcintosh.

98
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,210
I really don't see how that's
supposed to make me feel better.

99
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,920
It probably means that being
the last one in your class

100
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,260
to get a cutie mark
runs in the family.

101
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,880
"Runs in the family"?

102
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,640
"Runs in the family"!

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
You've got apples
for your cutie mark.

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,520
Granny Smith
has an apple pie.

105
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,730
Big Mcintosh
has an apple half.

106
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,940
My unique talent must have
something to do with apples!

107
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,360
Apples, apples, apples!

108
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,900
Apples.

109
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,620
Get your delicious,
nutritious apples here.

110
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,540
Delicious and nutritious
and so many uses.

111
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,540
You can eat 'em,
play with 'em...

112
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,710
Hey! Watch it!

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,300
...create fine art
for your home with 'em.

114
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,890
You'd have to be crazy not to
get a bushel of your very own.

115
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,850
She's so creative.

116
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,850
You, sir!

117
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,600
Care to buy
some apples?

118
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,600
Uh, no, thanks.

119
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,730
Why not?

120
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,060
I have plenty at home.

121
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,150
Are you sure?

122
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,360
Yes, I'm pretty sure.
You're pretty sure,

123
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,530
But you're not absolutely,
positively,

124
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,610
completely, superduper sure,
are you?

125
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,830
Uh, if I buy some apples,
will you please leave me alone?

126
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,040
All right!

127
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,330
You forgot your change!

128
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,920
Whoo-Hoo!

129
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,590
There's how you sell some apples
and get a cutie mark.

130
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,840
So, what does my cutie mark
look like --

131
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,630
A shopping bag
full of apples?

132
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,760
A satisfied customer
eating an apple?

133
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,800
Hmm.

134
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,720
Maybe I got to increase
my sales figures first.

135
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,890
You touch it,
you buy it!

136
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,770
We take cash or credit.

137
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm sorry, ma'am.

138
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,770
Ma'am!

139
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,730
Now, Apple Bloom,
you can't just...

140
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,030
That'll be four bits.

141
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,950
I didn't put those
in my bag.

142
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,370
Likely story.

143
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,660
Four bits, lady.

144
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,530
Apple Bloom!

145
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,990
I am really, really sorry
about that.

146
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,120
She's new.

147
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Here. Take these.
No charge.

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And these.

149
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,840
And these.

150
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,840
Y'all come back now,
you hear?

151
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,140
What?

152
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,600
Sorry, little sis, but your
apple-selling days are over.

153
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,520
What?!

154
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,690
But how else am I gonna get
my cutie mark?

155
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,110
Home. Now!

156
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,610
Pbht!

157
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,070
Hmph.

158
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,190
Listen, sugar cube,

159
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,860
I know it's hard to wait
for your very own cutie mark,

160
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,030
but you just can't
force it.

161
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,910
Besides, you're not
that grown up just yet.

162
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,210
Ain't there other fillies
in your class without one?

163
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,710
Well, twist
doesn't have hers yet.

164
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,960
Do you think
you'd feel better

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,540
if you went to the party
with her?

166
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,920
Mm-Hmm.
Well, there you go.

167
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,800
Bet you and Twist would have
a great time together.

168
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,880
Now, run along
and find your friend.

169
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,050
You're sure you don't want me
to stick around

170
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,560
Till the end of the market?

171
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,520
Hey, who's been using
my racket?!

172
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,690
Yeah, I'm sure.

173
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,940
Oh, what's up,
Apple Bloom?

174
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,190
So, I was thinking.

175
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,660
Maybe we could go to Diamond
Tiara's cute-ceañera together.

176
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,580
I-I don't have
a cutie mark.

177
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,200
You don't have
a cutie mark.

178
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
Well, um...

179
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,130
Isn't my cutie mark
swell?

180
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,750
I've always loved
making my own savory sweets,

181
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,880
but it took me some time
to discover

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,920
that it was
my super-special talent.

183
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,220
Pretty sweet, huh?

184
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,930
Yeah.

185
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,140
Pretty...sweet.

186
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,390
Hey...

187
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,270
this doesn't mean we can't go
to the cute-ceañera together.

188
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,230
You're still gonna come
to the party, aren't you?

189
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,940
Of course she will.

190
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,190
It's not like being the only
pony there without a cutie mark

191
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,110
will be, like, the most
embarrassing thing ever.

192
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,790
Whoa.

193
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,960
Looks like somepony's got a dark
cloud hanging over her head.

194
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,800
Let me do something
about that.

195
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,380
What's the matter,
kid?

196
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,310
There's a cute-ceañera
this afternoon,

197
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,680
and everypony in my class
will be there,

198
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,730
and they'll all have
their cutie marks,

199
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,950
and I want to get my
cutie mark, but I'm no
good at selling apples,

200
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,270
but I really
want to go to the party,

201
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,390
but how could I go to
the party if I don't
have my cutie mark,

202
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,290
which my big sister says
I'm gonna get eventually,

203
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,650
But I want it now!

204
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,650
Cutie mark?

205
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,990
I can get you a cutie mark
like that.

206
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,660
Applejack says these things
take time.

207
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,830
I have to just wait for it
to happen.

208
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,500
Why wait for something to happen
when you can make it happen?

209
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,420
But Applejack
says that --

210
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,500
Hey, who are you
gonna listen to --

211
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,420
Applejack or the pony
who was first in her class

212
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,590
to get a cutie mark?

213
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,130
I always liked flying
and all,

214
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,010
but I was going nowhere
in a hurry.

215
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,840
It wasn't until
my very first race

216
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,010
that I discovered
a serious need for speed,

217
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,060
and -- Kazaam! --
This sweet baby appeared

218
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,730
as fast as lightning.

219
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,770
That's right.

220
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,190
Stretch out those legs.

221
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,030
Got to be
nice and loose.

222
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,650
The key here is to try
as many things as possible

223
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
as quickly as possible.

224
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,490
One of them is bound to lead
to your cutie mark.

225
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,620
Are you ready?

226
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,740
I'm ready!

227
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,160
I said,
are you ready?!

228
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,910
I'm ready!

229
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,830
Juggling -- Go!

230
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,170
Uhh!

231
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,630
Hang gliding -- Go!

232
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,100
Whoa! Unh!

233
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,680
Karate -- Go!

234
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,940
Hyah!

235
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,190
Kite flying -- Go!

236
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,090
Ultra pony
roller derby -- Go!

237
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,470
Wha! Whoa!

238
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,940
Tried that one.

239
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,820
Tried that one.
Tried that one.

240
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,820
Your new outfit is, like,
perfect for the party.

241
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,950
I know.

242
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,120
It totally shows off
my new cutie mark.

243
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,790
I love being special.

244
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,540
Can you imagine how embarrassing
it must be to be...

245
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,540
not special?

246
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,920
I don't even want to, like,
think about it.

247
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Tried that one.

248
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,210
tried that one.

249
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,210
I'm doomed -- Doomed!

250
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,550
I'll never find something
I'm good at!

251
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,850
You look like you'd be good
at eating cupcakes.

252
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,810
Eating cupcakes?

253
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,720
Eating cupcakes?

254
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,980
Eating cupcakes!

255
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,810
I really appreciate
all your help, Rainbow Dash.

256
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,270
You're a really great coach,

257
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,730
and I've really
learned a lot from you,

258
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,900
and I'm sure
I can learn a lot more,

259
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,030
but I've got
some cupcakes to eat!

260
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,860
See you
at the cute-ceañera!

261
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,240
Hold on, Pinkie Pie,
I'm coming!

262
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,330
I can't believe
I didn't think of this --

263
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,660
A cupcake-eating
cutie mark.

264
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,920
It's so obvious.

265
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,170
Now,
where are those cupcakes?

266
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,210
I'm ready to chow down!

267
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,960
I don't have
any cupcakes.

268
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,760
Oh.

269
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,840
But you look like you'd be good
at helping me make some!

270
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,140
I guess a making-cupcakes
cutie mark could work, too.

271
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,560
* All you have to do
Is take a cup of flour *

272
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,270
* Add it to the mix

273
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,520
* Now just take a little
Something sweet, not sour *

274
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,610
* A bit of salt,
Just a pinch *

275
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,230
* Baking these treats
Is such a cinch *

276
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,280
* Add a teaspoon of vanilla

277
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,070
* Add a little more,
And you count to four, *

278
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,110
* And you never get
Your fill-a *

279
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,030
* Cupcakes,
So sweet and tasty *

280
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,910
* Cupcakes,
Don't be too hasty *

281
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,540
* Cupcakes,
Cupcakes, cupcakes, cupcakes! *

282
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,050
Hot! Hot! Hot!

283
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,140
Ooh! Those look much better
than the last batch.

284
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,190
Yuck!

285
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,650
Guess I'm not cut out to be
a baker, either.

286
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,820
I just have to face it.

287
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,070
I'm gonna have
a blank flank forever!

288
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,990
What about that?

289
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,150
What about what?

290
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,320
Is there something
on my flank?

291
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,580
Is there? Is there?
Is there?

292
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,040
A cutie mark!

293
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,120
It's a...

294
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,250
A measuring cup? No.

295
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,250
A mixing bowl? No.

296
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,130
Are those cupcakes?

297
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,800
A tower of cupcakes, maybe.

298
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,380
Flour! It's flour!

299
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,680
Yay!
I guessed it!

300
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,260
What game
do you want to play next?

301
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,100
Please say bingo.
Please say bingo.

302
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Whoa! What's been
going on in here?

303
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,390
We've been making cupcakes.
Want to try one?

304
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,060
No, thank you,

305
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,400
not that they don't look delicious.

306
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,190
Twilight,
you have to help me.

307
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,280
What's the matter?

308
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,460
Tiara's cute-ceañera is
today, and everypony in
my class will be there,

309
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,230
and they all have
their cutie marks,

310
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,110
and I want to get my cutie mark,

311
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,520
but I'm no good at selling
apples or hang-gliding
or making cupcakes,

312
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,420
but I want to go to the party,
but how can I go to the party

313
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,190
if I don't have my cutie mark,
which Pinkie Pie says

314
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,520
I can't just make appear,
but I need it to appear

315
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,930
Right now!

316
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,670
Uh...I don't follow.

317
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,260
How can I help you?

318
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,180
You can use your magic
to make my cutie mark appear.

319
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,970
Oh, no, Apple Bloom.

320
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,390
A cutie mark is something

321
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,890
that a pony has to discover
for herself.

322
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,140
Please, Twilight,
just try.

323
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,100
I'm sorry, but --

324
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,360
Oh, please, please,
please, please, please!

325
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,480
All right, all right!

326
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,150
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

327
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,860
Yes!

328
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,280
I knew you could do...it.

329
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,280
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but I told you.

330
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,740
Try again!
Try again!

331
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,390
Told you
that not even magic

332
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,430
can make a cutie mark appear
before its time.

333
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,970
It's hopeless --
Hopeless!

334
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
I just won't go
to the party.

335
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,400
I can't go.

336
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,400
Everyone
will just laugh at me

337
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,860
and make fun of me
and call me names.

338
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,150
It will be the worst night
of my life.

339
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,780
I'm sure it won't be
as bad as all that.

340
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,570
Forget it.

341
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,070
There's no way
I'm going to that...

342
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,450
...party.

343
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,010
How could I have forgotten
the time?

344
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,260
How could I have forgotten

345
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,100
Pinkie Pie
was hosting the party?

346
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,770
How could I have forgotten
it was at Sugar Cube Corner?

347
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,100
Don't forget your party hat,
forgetty forgeterson.

348
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,770
I have to get out of here
before anypony sees me.

349
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,860
Hey!

350
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,240
It's my cute-ceañera!

351
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm supposed to get
the first bite of cake!

352
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,060
Okay, Apple Bloom,
almost there.

353
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Apple Bloom,
you made it!

354
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,290
After I heard about Twist,

355
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,000
I was afraid
you wouldn't show up.

356
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,790
I sure am glad
you came to your senses

357
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,290
about this whole
cutie-mark thing.

358
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,170
These things happen when these
things are supposed to happen.

359
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,840
Trying to rush it
will just drive you crazy.

360
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,800
I'll let you be.

361
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,880
Looks like your friends
want to talk to you.

362
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,270
Well, well, well,
look who's here.

363
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,060
Nice outfit.

364
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,270
Just something I, uh,
pulled together last minute.

365
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,400
I really shows off
your cutie mark.

366
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,280
Oh, wait. That's right.

367
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,450
You don't have one.

368
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,240
I have a cutie mark.

369
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,990
What? Since when?

370
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,000
Since, um, earlier today.

371
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,290
Oh, really?
Let's see it.

372
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,290
I-I shouldn't.
I-I couldn't.

373
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,170
My cutie mark
is so unbelievably amazing.

374
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,460
I'm afraid
that if I show it off,

375
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,970
everyone will start paying
attention to me instead of you.

376
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,970
Outshined at your own
cute-ceañera?

377
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,140
Can you imagine
how embarrassing that would be?

378
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,390
Uh, forget it.

379
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,480
I didn't really
want to see it anyway.

380
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,650
Okay.
Well, I'm gonna go mingle.

381
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,360
Enjoy your party.

382
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,450
Oh, no!

383
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,370
Wow!

384
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,000
That is an amazing
cutie mark.

385
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,920
Nice try...

386
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,290
blank flank!
Blank flank!

387
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,050
Blank flank.

388
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,130
Does one of you got a problem
with blank flanks?

389
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,560
I said, you got a problem
with blank flanks?

390
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,390
The problem is, I mean, she's,
like, totally not special.

391
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,270
No, it means
she's full of potential.

392
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,310
It means she could be great
at anything.

393
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,360
The possibilities
are, like, endless.

394
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,570
She could be a great scientist

395
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,320
or an amazing artist

396
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,990
or a famous writer.

397
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,160
She could even be mayor
of Ponyville someday.

398
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,040
And she's not stuck
being stuck-up like you two.

399
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,670
Hey!
This is my party.

400
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,500
Why are two on her side?

401
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,630
Because...

402
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,420
You don't have
any cutie marks, either?!

403
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,630
I thought
I was the only one.

404
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,970
We thought
we were the only two.

405
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,470
I, for one, think you are three
very lucky fillies.

406
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,560
Lucky?
How can they be lucky?

407
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,150
They still get to experience
the thrill

408
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,320
of discovering who they are
and what they're meant to be.

409
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,570
And they've got all the time
in the world to figure it out,

410
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,200
not just an afternoon.

411
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,990
Wow! Apple Bloom!

412
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,200
Do you really think
you can be anything?

413
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,030
I wish
I could be a scientist!

414
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Maybe I got my cutie mark
too soon.

415
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,160
Hey,
what's everypony doing?

416
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,290
This is my party.

417
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,590
Everypony is supposed to be
paying attention to me!

418
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,710
Whatever.

419
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,170
We still think you're losers,
right, Diamond Tiara?

420
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,130
Bump, bump,
sugar...rump?

421
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,430
Not now, Silver Spoon.

422
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,720
Name's Scootaloo.

423
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,350
And I'm Sweetie Belle.

424
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,020
Apple Bloom.

425
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,440
This song is so super!

426
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,740
So, I was thinking,
now that we're friends --

427
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,450
I mean,
we are friends, right?

428
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,200
How could we not be?
We're totally alike.

429
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,540
We don't have
cutie marks,

430
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,540
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon
drive us crazy.

431
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,040
Totally crazy!

432
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,670
Well,
now that we're friends,

433
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,010
what if the three of us
work together

434
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,300
to find out who we are
and what we're supposed to be?

435
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,550
Ooh! Ooh!

436
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,140
We could form
our own secret society.

437
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,520
I'm liking this idea.

438
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,100
A secret society.
Yeah.

439
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,640
We'll need a name for it,
though.

440
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,610
The cutie-mark three?

441
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,320
The cute-tastically
fantastics?

442
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,280
How about...
the cutie-mark crusaders?

443
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,280
It's perfect!

444
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,410
This is gonna be
so great!

445
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,160
We're gonna be
unstoppable!

446
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,410
What do you say
we celebrate

447
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,120
with some of these
delicious cupcakes?

448
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,210
Not the cupcakes!

449
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,500
Trust me.

450
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,670
Let's see if there are
any cookies.

451
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,210
Yeah!
Come on.

452
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,380
"Dearest Princess Celestia,

453
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,340
"I am happy to report that one
of your youngest subjects

454
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,760
"has learned a valuable lesson
about friendship.

455
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,430
"Sometimes the thing you think

456
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,180
will cause you to lose friends
and feel left out..."

457
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,520
"...can actually be the thing

458
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
"that helps you make
your closest friends

459
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,190
and realize how special
you are."

460
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,190
Hmm.

461
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,200
* My Little Pony

462
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,370
* My Little Pony

463
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,170
* My Little Pony

464
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,210
* Friends
