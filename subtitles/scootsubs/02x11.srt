1
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:13,435
We're getting closer.

2
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:15,235
I can hardly wait!

3
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,675
I'm so excited I...
I feel like shouting.

4
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:20,635
Woohoo.

5
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:24,025
Whoo wee! Canterlot, here we come!

6
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,085
Oh, I do hope I look festive enough.

7
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:29,985
There it is! Canterlot!

8
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:32,535
Ooh!

9
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:38,165
Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful
this time of year?

10
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:41,845
Yeah. I wish it was Hearth's
Warming Eve every day.

11
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:44,165
There's so much to look at here.

12
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:47,075
I feel like my durn eyes are gonna
pop right outta my head.

13
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:48,115
I have an idea.

14
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,735
Let's play "I spy with my little eye"
as we walk. I'll go first.

15
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,355
I spy...

16
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,475
...an eight foot candy cane.

17
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,195
I spy a snowpony.

18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,845
I spy somepony eating
a gingerbread house.

19
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:05,805
And it's me!

20
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,105
I can't believe that
Princess Celestia chose us...

21
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,585
...to put on the most
important play of the season.

22
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:07,245
Do you guys know what
an honor this is? For all of us?

23
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:10,125
Oh. I wish she hadn't
honored me quite so much.

24
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:14,165
I can't go on stage. I don't want
everypony looking at me!

25
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,795
Fluttershy, darling, there is
nothing to feel nervous about.

26
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:18,465
No?

27
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:23,255
Of course not. All across
Equestria ponies are preparing...

28
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:26,545
...their own pageants for Hearth's
Warming Eve in their own towns.

29
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:27,725
It's tradition.

30
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,885
So you're saying they'll be
too busy to come to our play?

31
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,855
Well, no. We're in
the Canterlot pageant...

32
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:36,825
...the biggest, most important
production in all of Equestria.

33
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:39,475
A lot of ponies will come to watch us.

34
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:40,605
A lot?

35
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:41,795
Hundreds.

36
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:43,055
Hundreds?

37
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,995
Maybe even thousands!

38
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,275
Oh! My hair!

39
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:54,935
Applejack, be a dear and
shut those windows, will you?

40
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,675
Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!

41
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:02,205
Thank you! Thank you!

42
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:05,015
It's a reenactment
of the founding of Equestria.

43
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:07,295
It's not "The Rainbow Dash Show".

44
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:11,195
Well, it should be "The Rainbow
Dash Show". I'm the star.

45
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:14,325
Fluttershy! You've got to
come out of there!

46
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:15,825
Curtain in two minutes.

47
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,005
Twilight, let me handle this.

48
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:18,895
My hair!

49
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:21,555
PIIINKIEEE...

50
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:26,755
The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant
is about harmony and friendship...

51
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:28,995
SHUT THE WINDOW!

52
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,985
Once upon a time, long before
the peaceful rule of Celestia...

53
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:43,195
...and before ponies discovered
our beautiful land of Equestria...

54
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:46,035
...ponies did not know harmony.

55
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,735
It was a strange and dark time...

56
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:50,885
...a time when ponies
were torn apart...

57
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:52,065
...by hatred.

58
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,025
I know. Can you believe it?

59
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:59,085
During this frightful age
each of the three tribes...

60
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:02,095
...the pegasi, the unicorns
and the earth ponies...

61
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:07,645
...cared not for what befell the other
tribes, but only for their own welfare.

62
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:10,155
In those troubled times, as now...

63
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,645
...the pegasi were
the stewards of the weather...

64
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,915
...but they demanded
something in return...

65
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:19,705
...food that could only
be grown by the earth ponies.

66
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:28,575
The unicorns demanded the same...

67
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:33,935
...in return for magically
bringing forth day and night.

68
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,385
And so mistrust between
the tribes festered...

69
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:41,125
...until one fateful day
it came to a boil.

70
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,535
And what prompted the ponies to clash?

71
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:47,695
'Twas a mysterious blizzard,
that overtook the land...

72
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:51,315
...and toppled the tribes'
precarious peace.

73
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:56,745
The normally industrious earth ponies
were unable to farm their land.

74
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:06,295
The earth ponies were freezing.

75
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:09,125
Home of the pegasi fared no better.

76
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:13,035
The pegasi were hungry.

77
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,535
And the unicorns were
freezing *and* hungry.

78
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:23,575
Even the unicorns' magic was
powerless against the storm.

79
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:30,495
Each tribe blamed the others
for their suffering...

80
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,645
...and the angrier everypony grew,
the worse the blizzard became.

81
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:39,955
And so it was decided, that
a grand summit will be held...

82
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:42,615
...to figure out a way
to cope with the blizzard.

83
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:45,015
Each tribe sent their leaders.

84
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,445
Daughter of the unicorn
king: Princess Platinum.

85
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:55,345
Ruler of the pegasi:
Commander Hurricane.

86
00:05:55,345 --> 00:06:00,795
And lastly leader of the earth
ponies: Chancellor Puddinghead.

87
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:04,515
Perhaps the three tribes could
finally settle their differences...

88
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:08,175
...and agree on a way
to get through this disaster.

89
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:17,155
All I wanna know is why the earth
ponies are hogging all the food.

90
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,965
US?! We're not hogging
all the food. You are!

91
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,745
Oh, wait. You're right. It's us.

92
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:27,975
Well, it's only cause you mean old
pegasuseseses are making it snow like crazy!

93
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:30,825
For the hundredth time, it's not us!

94
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,465
We're not making it snow.

95
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,545
It must be the unicorns!

96
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,745
They're doing it with
their freaky magic.

97
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:39,075
How dare you?!

98
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:43,805
Unlike you pegasi ruffians, we unicorns
would never stoop to such a thing.

99
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:45,005
Ha-Me-Ph.

100
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:45,975
Hmph.

101
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:49,325
Well, if you non-earths aren't gonna
stop using your weirdo powers...

102
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,685
...to freeze us all, then
I'm just plum out of ideas.

103
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:56,315
What a shocker!
An earth pony with no ideas.

104
00:06:56,315 --> 00:07:00,355
Commander Hurricane!
Please cease with the insults!

105
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:03,055
You're not the boss of me,
your royal snootiness!

106
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,825
I BEG YOUR PARDON!

107
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,955
I am a princess!
I won't be spoken to that way!

108
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,005
Well, I'm leaving first!

109
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,955
No, I'm first!

110
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:19,165
And the blizzard raged on.

111
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:26,975
So the summit of the tribes did not
turn out as well as hoped...

112
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,305
...and the three leaders returned
home to lick their wounds...

113
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,225
...and basically complain.

114
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,475
ATTEN-TION!

115
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:44,445
Well? Aren't you curious
about how it went?

116
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,825
Oh! Uh... Commander Hurricane, sir!
How did it go, sir?

117
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:51,325
Horribly! Those other tribe
leaders are so disrespectful.

118
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:54,025
Don't they realize that we are
a mighty tribe of warriors...

119
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:55,415
...and should not be crossed?

120
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:58,095
We have got to break ranks
with those weak foals.

121
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,365
Clover the Clever! I need you!

122
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,095
Yes, your majesty.

123
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,695
Did the other pony tribes
see reason as I predicted?

124
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:12,045
Those other tribes are impossible.

125
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:16,765
I, for one, can no longer bear to be
anywhere near the lowly creatures.

126
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:19,275
The unicorns are noble and majestic.

127
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:22,415
We will no longer consort
with the likes of them.

128
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:32,575
Wouldn't it have been easier
to use the door, Chancellor?

129
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:36,475
Maybe for you, Smart Cookie.
But I am a chancellor.

130
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,135
I was elected, because I know
how to think outside the box.

131
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,165
Which means...

132
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:43,615
...I can also think inside the chimney.

133
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,515
Can you think inside the chimney?

134
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:49,455
-I...
-I didn't think so.

135
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,555
Oh my gosh. Hold on to your hooves...

136
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:57,705
I am just about to be brilliant!

137
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,885
That'd be a first.

138
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:02,765
I have decided that the earth
ponies are gonna go it alone.

139
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,505
Aw, so you mean the other
tribes didn't come around?

140
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:08,135
Shoot. I really thought we could
get through to them if we...

141
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:09,375
Don't worry about them.

142
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,245
We're the ones with
all the food, right?

143
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,545
Uh, actually we're all out.

144
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:18,635
Fine. Then we'll have to go somewhere
near where we can grow some new food.

145
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:22,535
And with me as our fearless
leader, what could go wrong?

146
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:25,335
Where should I start?

147
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,475
The point is...

148
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:30,765
We must find a new land!

149
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:37,015
Come on, Private Pansy.
Let's get a move on.

150
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,595
Hup one, hup two...

151
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:42,525
Get a hold of yourself, private!

152
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,425
We cannot let anything distract us
from the mission at hand.

153
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:49,545
To find (and if necessary
to conquer) a new land.

154
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:51,675
Conquer, sir?

155
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,435
Never know where enemies
might be lurking.

156
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:56,505
I don't see any enemies, commander.

157
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:58,455
Just snow.

158
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,545
Aha! Who's that?

159
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,375
Okay, this is getting old.

160
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,665
Mm, this is simply taking forever.

161
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:17,825
My hooves are killing me.
How long have we been walking for?

162
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,915
About five minutes, Your Highness.

163
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:24,225
I never imagined finding
a new land would be so hard.

164
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,455
But it'll all be worth it.

165
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:26,575
Don't you agree?

166
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:29,795
I actually think that the three
tribes could have tried harder.

167
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,805
STOOOP!

168
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,845
-What's wrong?
-That is what's wrong.

169
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,295
Your Highness, it's just a stream.

170
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,865
We can cross it easily.

171
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:44,995
I refuse to get my gown wet.

172
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,935
I have no intention
of arriving at my new land...

173
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,045
...looking like
a bedraggled earth pony.

174
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,885
Or worse yet,
a rough-and-tumble pegasus.

175
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,505
I, for one, have no intention
of stooping down to their level.

176
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:59,865
On the other hand, I have no trouble
watching *you* stoop down.

177
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,935
And do watch the gown, darling.

178
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:06,735
It's worth more than all
of the books in your library.

179
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,455
Yes, yes.

180
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,975
This is definitely the right direction.

181
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:18,715
It feels like we're going in circles.

182
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:22,785
But that's impossible! Are you suggesting
that I'm reading the map wrong?

183
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:24,635
Absolutely not, your chancellorness.

184
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:27,565
It's just that there are
holes in the map and...

185
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:30,825
Of course! How else could I
see where I was going!?

186
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,385
Yeah, uh...

187
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:34,725
Or talk? I need to be able to talk.

188
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:38,185
I mean, how would we survive
if I just only shut up?

189
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:41,125
Heaven forbid that should happen,
your chancellorship.

190
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,505
It's just that the map
is also upside down.

191
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,655
I got a news flash for you, Cookie.

192
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,065
The earth is round.
There is no up or down.

193
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,845
You're right!

194
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:54,525
It's such a relief to me, that
you're in charge of this map.

195
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:55,805
Relief?!

196
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,865
You don't need relief! If anypony
needs relief around here, it's me!

197
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:02,295
I'm a chancellor! I'm a big shot.
You're just my, uh...

198
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,535
...my...

199
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:04,565
Secretary.

200
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:05,455
Whatever.

201
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:10,495
You take the map, while
I enjoy some relief.

202
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:12,735
Yes, chancellor Puddinghead.

203
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:18,565
And so each leader encountered
obstacles along the way.

204
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:23,715
But eventually they all arrived
in the new and wondrous land.

205
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:27,295
Nopony ever seen paradise before.

206
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,965
This is the new land
we've been searching for!

207
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:35,025
What a view. I can see
my future house from here.

208
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:37,395
I proclaim this new land to be...

209
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:40,665
Pegasopolis!

210
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:43,455
I've never seen such jewels.

211
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:47,185
This ruby is dazzling.
This whole land is dazzling!

212
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:49,155
I'm double-dazzled!

213
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:54,945
In the name of the unicorns
I hereby dub this land Unicornia.

214
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:58,075
The air! The trees!

215
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:03,865
The dirt. This dirt is the dirtiest
dirt in the whole dirt world!

216
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:06,215
And fertile too.
Perfect to grow on food.

217
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:10,555
In the name of the earth ponies,
I think I'm gonna call this new place...

218
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:11,655
Uh...

219
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:13,215
Dirtville!

220
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:15,075
How about Earth?

221
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,055
Earth!

222
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:20,705
Congratulations to me
for thinking of it.

223
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:25,175
We've found our new home!

224
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:32,705
I planted my flag first.

225
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:34,735
-Did not!
-Did too!

226
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:37,485
I planted mine earlier than first.

227
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:40,515
All of you riffraff
are trespassing in Unicornia.

228
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:42,695
The name is Pegasopolis.

229
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:44,455
-Earth!
-Pegasopolis!

230
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:46,075
Unicornia!

231
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,885
I say we fight for the land.

232
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:49,765
May the best pony win.

233
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:51,215
That's barbaric.

234
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:54,815
Clover the Clever, throw
that brute into the dungeon.

235
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,495
What dungeon?! Look.
Perhaps if we all calm down...

236
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:02,165
I agree. Let's all calm down.

237
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:03,845
I vote for calm.

238
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:07,745
I'll have you court-martialled
for insubordination, private!

239
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:10,345
We settle this on the battlefield.

240
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,625
Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!

241
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:22,405
Wait a minute. Where'd all this
snow come from anyway?

242
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:24,435
Oh no. Not again.

243
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:36,385
And so the paradise that the ponies
had found was soon lost...

244
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:40,415
...buried beneath a thick blanket
of snow and hard feelings.

245
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:43,895
Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy.

246
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:46,465
Instead of wonderful, it was wintery.

247
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:49,735
Instead of spectacular,
it was snowtacular!

248
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:52,665
-Instead of...
-We get it! Move on!

249
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,805
Everypony was forced to seek shelter.

250
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,135
They searched high and low...

251
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:03,725
...but the only shelter for miles
was a cold and desolate cave.

252
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:07,915
And, of course, the three
tribes had to share it.

253
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:11,275
And nopony was too happy about that.

254
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:13,985
Please, Commander Hothead...

255
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:16,125
It's Commander Hurricane!

256
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:22,065
Please, Commander, could you just
stand back and give me my royal space?

257
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:24,315
You mean like this, Your Highness?

258
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:25,515
Indeed not.

259
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:27,935
You see this invisible line?

260
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:32,065
Private, outline our territory
for everypony to see.

261
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:36,525
See this real, non-invisible line?

262
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:40,305
No unicorns or earth ponies
are allowed to cross it.

263
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:43,615
This is the sovereign
territory of Pegasopolis.

264
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:46,835
-Clover the Clever!
-Smart Cookie!

265
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:48,385
I know, I know.

266
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,535
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

267
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:59,325
Don't go around the rock. Go over it.

268
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,745
I'm not giving up an inch
of territory to the enemy.

269
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:05,855
That rock is clearly on the Unicornia's
side of the cave and it belongs to us.

270
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:08,415
Who knows? There could be jewels inside.

271
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,215
I claim this rock for Pegasopolis.

272
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:15,625
Unhand that rock this
instant, you scoundrel!

273
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:19,325
Oh, lookie, found my rock.
I've been looking for it everywhere.

274
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:22,045
Hey!

275
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,635
You invaded our territory!

276
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:25,845
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

277
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,975
That's the last straw!

278
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:32,405
Give me my rock!

279
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,915
Look, everypony! The entrance!

280
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:55,075
Great. Now there's
no way out. We're trapped.

281
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,315
You two deserve this horrible fate.

282
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,865
You've done nothing but argue
and fight with each other.

283
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:02,205
You've been fighting too,
"Your Highness".

284
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,555
Yeah! Worse!

285
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,235
I haven't been fighting
nearly as much as you!

286
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,645
How ridiculous!

287
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:09,525
A unicorn never stoops to fighting.

288
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:12,855
That's just cause you wimpy
unicorns know you never win.

289
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:15,405
Earth ponies are numbskul...!

290
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:17,195
Pegasi are brut...!

291
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:19,255
Unicorns are snob...!

292
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:38,695
What is that thing?

293
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:41,505
They must be... windigos.

294
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:43,445
Windigos?

295
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,705
My mentor, Star Swirl the Bearded,
taught me about them.

296
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:49,905
They're winter spirits that feed
on fighting and hatred.

297
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:54,045
The more hate the spirit feels,
the colder things become.

298
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:56,355
Then this is our fault.

299
00:17:56,545 --> 00:18:00,255
We, three tribes. We brought
this blizzard to our home...

300
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:02,875
...by fightin' and
not trustin' each other.

301
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,135
Now it's destroyin' this land too.

302
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,995
And now our bodies will
become as cold as our hearts.

303
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:12,015
All because we were
foolish enough to hate.

304
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,345
Well, I don't hate you.

305
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:19,625
I actually hate Commander Hurricane
a lot more than I hate you guys.

306
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,895
Actually, I don't really hate her.

307
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:27,925
I just really, really,
really, really, really...

308
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:31,245
...really, really, really,
really, really dislike her.

309
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:37,655
-Well, I don't hate you guys either.
-Nor do I.

310
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:43,265
No matter what our differences,
we're all ponies.

311
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:05,245
What was that?!

312
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,265
I didn't know unicorns could do that.

313
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:08,375
I didn't either.

314
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,505
Nothing like this has
ever happened before.

315
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:12,945
But I know it couldn't
have been just me.

316
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:17,275
It came from all three of us
join together in friendship.

317
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:21,505
All through the night the three ponies
kept the fire of friendship alive...

318
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:24,755
...by telling stories to one another
and by singing songs...

319
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:29,585
...which of course became the winter
carols that we all still sing today.

320
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,605
Eventually the warmth of the
fire and singing and laughing...

321
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,485
...reached the leaders and
their bodies began to thaw.

322
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:41,965
And it even began to melt their hearts.

323
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:58,305
The three leaders agreed to
share the beautiful land...

324
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:01,075
...and with it harmony,
ever afterwards...

325
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,065
...and together they
named their new land...

326
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:05,975
Equestria!

327
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:24,155
<i>The fire of friendship
lives in our hearts</i>

328
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:28,405
<i>As long as it burns,
we cannot drift apart</i>

329
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:32,555
<i>Though quarrels arise,
their numbers are few</i>

330
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:38,305
<i>Laughter and singing will see us through
(Will see us through)</i>

331
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:42,145
<i>We are a circle of pony friends</i>

332
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:50,875
<i>A circle of friends
we'll be to the very end</i>

333
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:59,665
We should be so honored that
Princess Celestia chose us.

334
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:03,865
She must really think we exemplify
what good friends are.

335
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,315
Applejack, I thought you
closed all the windows.

336
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:09,565
Don't blame me.

337
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,965
Rainbow Dash should have flown up there
and shut it. After all, she's got wings.

338
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:15,525
Why do I always have to do
all the high-up chores?

339
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,135
Why can't Twilight use
her magic for a change?

340
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,175
You know what? I've got it.

341
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:36,535
