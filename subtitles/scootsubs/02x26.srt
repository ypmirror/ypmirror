1
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:06,765
Princess Celestia cordially
invites you to the wedding of

2
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:09,625
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza,
and...

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:10,975
my brother?!

4
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:12,475
Twilie!

5
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,205
Ah, I've missed you, kid.

6
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:17,255
How dare you not tell me in person
that you were getting married!

7
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:19,475
A threat has been made
against Canterlot.

8
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:23,405
Princess Celestia asked that I help
provide additional protection.

9
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,675
But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying
somepony I don't even know.

10
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:30,015
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadence.

11
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:32,625
Cadence is only the most amazing
pony ever!

12
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,535
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

13
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,905
Cadence, it's me! Twilight!

14
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:45,085
And I think I should wear it.

15
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:47,045
Are you disagreeing with me?

16
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:51,855
She's evil!

17
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:55,405
I saw her put a spell on my brother
that made his eyes go all...

18
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,085
Cadence hasn't been
casting spells on me,

19
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:00,845
she's been using her magic to heal me.

20
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:04,205
If I were you, I wouldn't show up
to the wedding at all.

21
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,695
I just lost a brother.
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,205
You will be.

23
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:18,435


24
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:24,035


25
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:46,285


26
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,135
Hello?

27
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,555
Is anyone there?

28
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:06,725
Where am I?

29
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:09,345
The caves beneath Canterlot.

30
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:12,705
Once home to greedy unicorns
who wanted to claim the gems

31
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:14,185
that could be found inside.

32
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:17,315
And now, your prison.

33
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,015
Help! Help!

34
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,675
It's no use. No one can hear you.

35
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:25,625
And no one will ever think
to look for you, either.

36
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:28,955
Most ponies have forgotten
that these caves even exist.

37
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:33,275
Which is why they are the ideal place
to keep the ones who try to interfere

38
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:34,695
with my plans.

39
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:38,795
Plans? What plans?

40
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,985
The plans I have for your brother,
of course.

41
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:46,285
Don't you dare do anything
to my brother, you...

42
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:47,475
you monster!

43
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:50,785
Only way to stop me is to catch me!

44
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:54,835
Over here!

45
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:02,385
Nope,
over here!

46
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,525
No! Wait!

47
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,165
Please! Don't hurt me!

48
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,635
Twilight, it's me!

49
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:23,355
Please, you have to believe me.

50
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:25,085
I've been imprisoned like you.

51
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:27,735
The Cadence who brought you
down here was an impostor.

52
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:29,785
Likely story!

53
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:33,315
Sunshine, sunshine,
ladybugs awake.

54
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:34,615
Clap your hooves...

55
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,285
...and do a little shake.

56
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:41,175
You remember me!

57
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,115
Of course I do.

58
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,675
How could I forget the filly
I love to sit for the most?

59
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:55,245
We have to get out of here.

60
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,035
We have to stop her!

61
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:17,035
<i>This day is going to be perfect</i>

62
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:21,345
<i>The kind of day of which
I dreamed since I was small</i>

63
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:25,925
<i>Everypony will gather round,
say I look lovely in my gown</i>

64
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:30,605
<i>What they don't know is
that I have fooled them all!</i>

65
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,565
<i>This day was going to be perfect</i>

66
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:38,435
<i>The kind of day of which
I dreamed since I was small</i>

67
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:43,235
<i>But instead of having cake,
with all my friends to celebrate</i>

68
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:47,335
<i>My wedding bells they may
not ring for me at all</i>

69
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:49,545
<i>I could care less about the dress</i>

70
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:52,295
<i>I won't partake in any cake</i>

71
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:55,765
<i>Vows, well I'll be lying when I say</i>

72
00:04:55,915 --> 00:05:00,025
<i>That through any kind of weather,
I'll want us to be together</i>

73
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:04,105
<i>The truth is I don't care for him at all!</i>

74
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:07,335
<i>No, I do not love the groom</i>

75
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:11,175
<i>In my heart, there is no room</i>

76
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:17,895
<i>But I still want him to be all mine!</i>

77
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:22,145
<i>We must escape before it's too late,
find a way to save the day</i>

78
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:25,335
<i>Hope, I'll be lying if I say</i>

79
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:29,365
<i>I don't fear that I may lose him,
to one who wants to use him</i>

80
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:32,955
<i>Not care for, love and cherish
him each day</i>

81
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:36,305
<i>For I oh so love the groom</i>

82
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:40,355
<i>All my thoughts he does consume</i>

83
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:47,845
<i>Oh Shining Armor,
I'll be there very soon</i>

84
00:05:56,615 --> 00:06:00,425
<i>Finally the moment has arrived</i>

85
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:03,995
<i>For me to be one lucky bride</i>

86
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:07,705
<i>Oh, the wedding we won't make,
he'll end up marrying a fake</i>

87
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:10,525
<i>Shining Armor will be...</i>

88
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:12,995
Mine, all mine.

89
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:19,855
Mares and gentlecolts,

90
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,085
we are gathered here today
to witness the union of

91
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:26,955
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza
and Shining Armor.

92
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,235
We're never going to save him.

93
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:32,605
We will.
We just have to find...

94
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:35,145
there!

95
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:42,045
You're not going anywhere.

96
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,815
Princess Cadence and Shining Armor,

97
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,305
it is my great pleasure
to pronounce you...

98
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:57,625
Stop!

99
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,725
Why does she have to be
so possessive of her brother?

100
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:10,855
Why does she have
to ruin my special day?

101
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:14,865
Because it's not your special day.

102
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,115
It's mine.

103
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:18,365
What?

104
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,585
But how did you escape my bridesmaids?

105
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:32,215
I want it!

106
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:37,695
Clever. But you're still too late.

107
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:40,685
I don't understand.
How can there be two of 'em?

108
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,575
She's a changeling.

109
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:45,595
She takes the form of somepony
you love and gains power

110
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:47,245
by feeding off your love for them.

111
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:08,005
Right you are, Princess.

112
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,655
And as queen of the changelings,
it is up to me to find food

113
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:13,105
for my subjects.

114
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:16,915
Equestria has more love than
any place I've ever encountered.

115
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:20,745
My fellow changelings will be
able to devour so much of it

116
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:24,475
that we will gain more power
than we have ever dreamed of!

117
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,185
They'll never get the chance!

118
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:29,825
Shining Armor's protection spell
will keep them from ever even reaching us.

119
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:33,345
Oh, I doubt that.

120
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,095
Isn't that right, dear?

121
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:42,575
Don't wanna go back to the caves,
now do you?

122
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:49,015
Ever since I took your place, I've been
feeding off Shining Armor's love for you.

123
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:52,145
Every moment he grows weaker,
and so does his spell.

124
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:55,255
Even now my minions
are chipping away at it.

125
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:05,705
He may not be my husband,
but he is under my total control now.

126
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:13,205
And I'm sorry to say, unable to perform
his duties as captain of the royal guard.

127
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:14,795
Not my Shining Armor!

128
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:18,185
Soon, my changeling army
will break through.

129
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,195
First, we take Canterlot.
And then, all of Equestria!

130
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,875
No.

131
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,165
You won't.

132
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:31,395
You may have made it impossible
for Shining Armor to perform his spell,

133
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:34,795
but now that you have so foolishly
revealed your true self,

134
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:39,185
I can protect my subjects... from you!

135
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,395
Princess Celestia!

136
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:08,385
Shining Armor's love for you
is even stronger than I thought!

137
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:12,495
Consuming him has made me
even more powerful than Celestia!

138
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,775
The Elements of Harmony,
you must get to them...

139
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:18,375
and use their power
to defeat the queen.

140
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:26,085
Rarity!

141
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:34,895
You can run, but you can't hide!

142
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:55,925
Go, go!

143
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:18,665
Looks like we're gonna have
to do this the hard way.

144
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:27,425
How did you...?

145
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,925
They're changelings, remember?

146
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:39,805
<i>They're changelings, remember?</i>

147
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:41,605
Don't let them distract you.

148
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:43,605
We have to get to
the Elements of Harmony.

149
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:44,955
They're our only hope.

150
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:18,025
OK, this is just gettin' weird.

151
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:31,825
Real me! Real me!

152
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:38,815
Do me! Do me!

153
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:44,565
I've seen better.

154
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:39,455
You won't get away with this!

155
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:41,385
Twilight and her friends will...

156
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:46,015
You were saying?

157
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,405
You do realize the reception's
been cancelled, don't you?

158
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,445
Go! Feed!

159
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,645
It's funny, really.

160
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:01,845
Twilight here was suspicious of
my behavior all along.

161
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,525
Too bad the rest of you were too
caught up in your wedding planning

162
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:08,185
to realize those suspicions were correct.

163
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:11,345
Sorry, Twi.
We should've listened to you.

164
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:14,495
It's not your fault.
She fooled everypony.

165
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:17,065
I did, didn't I?

166
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:25,425
<i>This day has been just perfect</i>

167
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:30,235
<i>The kind of day of which
I've dreamed since I was small</i>

168
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:32,245
<i>Everypony I'll soon control</i>

169
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,565
<i>Every stallion, mare and foal</i>

170
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:39,285
<i>Who says a girl can't really have it all?</i>

171
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:47,025
Quick! Go to him while
you still have the chance!

172
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:13,595
Is...is the wedding over?

173
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:18,215
It's all over!

174
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,525
Your spell! Perform your spell!

175
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:27,115
What good would that do?
My changelings already roam free.

176
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,225
No!

177
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,275
My power is useless now.

178
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,395
I don't have the strength to repel them.

179
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:43,095
My love will give you strength.

180
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:47,785
What a lovely but absolutely
ridiculous sentiment.

181
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,315
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

182
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:55,825
You have a real wedding
to put together.

183
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:55,445
Seriously, though.

184
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:58,425
I get why the queen of the Changelings
wanted to be with you, but how did you

185
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:01,405
get someone as amazing as
Cadence to marry you?

186
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:03,905
I told her she wouldn't just
be gaining a husband,

187
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:06,625
she would be getting a
pretty great sister too.

188
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,995
Mares and gentlecolts,

189
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:35,585
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union of the real

190
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:37,575
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza...

191
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:39,145
Princess Cadence is fine.

192
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:43,765
The union of Princess Cadence
and Shining Armor.

193
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,995
The strength of their commitment
is clear.

194
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:48,795
The power of their love, undeniable.

195
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:50,835
May we have the rings, please?

196
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:58,315
I now pronounce you mare and colt.

197
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,185
This is your victory as much as theirs.

198
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:15,575
You persisted in the face of doubt.

199
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:20,445
And your actions led to your being able to
bring the real Princess Cadence back to us.

200
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:24,905
Learning to trust your instincts
is a valuable lesson to learn.

201
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:32,785
Rainbow Dash, that's your cue.

202
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:43,005
Best. Wedding. Ever!

203
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,735
Hello, everypony.
Did I miss anything?

204
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:04,675
Let's get this party started!

205
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,995
<i>Love is in bloom</i>

206
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:13,475
<i>A beautiful bride, a handsome groom</i>

207
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,745
<i>Two hearts becoming one</i>

208
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:21,785
<i>A bond that cannot be undone because</i>

209
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:25,325
<i>Love is in bloom</i>

210
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,995
<i>A beautiful bride, a handsome groom</i>

211
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,925
<i>I said, love is in bloom</i>

212
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:36,515
<i>Starting a life and making room</i>

213
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:38,165
<i>For us
(For us)</i>

214
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:42,855
Twilight!

215
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:46,115
None of this would've been
possible without you, little sis.

216
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,115
Love you, Twilie.

217
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:50,605
Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.

218
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,245
Ready to go?

219
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,025
Oh! Almost forgot.

220
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:03,505
IT'S MINE!

221
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:15,505
Now this was a great wedding.

222
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:16,755
Oh yeah?

223
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:20,445
Just wait until you see what I have
planned for the bachelor party!
