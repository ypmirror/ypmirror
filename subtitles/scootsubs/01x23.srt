1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,520
Oh, are you sure
about this, Scootaloo?

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,970
I've never even heard
of a pony zip-Lining before.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,420
Neither have i,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,630
But Spike
told me it was awesome!

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,300
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,430
Whoa!

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,820
Oh!
Whoa!

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,850
See anything?

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,320
Tree sap and pine needles,
but no cutie mark.

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,970
Plan B?

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,550
Yeah.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,300
You know where we can find
a cannon at this hour?

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,620
It's no use.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,840
No matter what we try,

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,140
We always end up
without our cutie marks,

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,360
And, surprisingly often,
covered in tree sap.

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,950
Maybe we should do something
less dangerous,

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,310
Like pillow testing

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,760
Or flower sniffing.

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,750
This town is full of ponies
who have their cutie marks.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,630
Why don't we ask them
how they did it?

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,060
That's a great,
safe idea.

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,240
Yeah, and we can start with
the coolest pony in Ponyville.

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,270
Applejack!
Rarity!

25
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,760
Come on, guys.
I said cool.

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,140
You know
who I'm talking about.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,410
She's fast, she's tough,
she's not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,700
Pinkie Pie?
Pinkie Pie?

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,610
No! The greatest flyer
ever to come out of cloudsdale.

30
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,110
Fluttershy?
Fluttershy?

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,480
No!
Rainbow Dash!

32
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,470
Oh, yeah,
that makes much more sense.

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,320
Of course.
Let's do it.

34
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,900
Let's find out how Rainbow Dash
earned her cutie mark.

35
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,800
Yeah!
Yeah!

36
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,000
Ah!

37
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:42,920
Ah! Unh!

38
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,620

https://yp1.yayponies.no/

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,630
Get back here,
you thievin' varmints!

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,120
Thievin' what, now?

41
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,160
Whoa!

42
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,190
Apple Bloom?

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,540
Hey, sis, how'd you get
your cutie mark?

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,260
I never told you
that story?

45
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,410
Hey, I thought we were
gonna ask Rainbow Dash.

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,060
We need all the help
we can get.

47
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,600
Ugh! Fine.

48
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,740
Why, shoot,
I was just a little filly --

49
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,740
Even littler than y'all.

50
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,450
I didn't want to spend my life
on a muddy old apple farm.

51
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,530
I wanted to live
the sophisticated life,

52
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,670
Like my aunt and uncle orange.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,350
So I set out to try my luck
in the big city -- Manehattan --

54
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,430
The most cosmopolitan city
in all of equestria.

55
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,090
Hey, out of the way! You rube!

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,930
I knew I'd find out who i
was meant to be in manehattan.

57
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,180
Aunt orange, uncle orange,

58
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,730
Thank y'all so much
for letting me stay.

59
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,580
"y'all."

60
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,450
Isn't she
just the living end?

61
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,070
How quaint.

62
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,960
Don't worry,
we'll have you acting

63
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,630
Like a true manehattanite
in no time.

64
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,780
And how are you finding
good old manehattan?

65
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,800
Oh, it's simply divine.

66
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,000
Very well said,
my dear.

67
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,820
Although, I must admit

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,890
The city noise
took some getting used to.

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,170
Where I'm from,
nights are so quiet,

70
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,970
You seldom hear a peep
until the roosters wake you.

71
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,250
The what?

72
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,920
I say, my dear, what
in the world is a...rooster?

73
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,720
What's he talking about?

74
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,520
What do I say? I don't
want to look like a fool.

75
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,010
Dinner is served.

76
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,320
Thank goodness.

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,450
Being a city pony
is hard work.

78
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,250
I'm so hungry,
I could eat a...

79
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,130
Cock-A-Doodle-Doo.

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,850
Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith
and Big Macintosh are up to.

81
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,170
I'll bet they're
Apple-Bucking their way

82
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,870
Through
the red delicious trees.

83
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,190
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for just one bite.

84
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,680
I never felt so homesick in all
my days as I did right then.

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,190
It was amazing.

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,520
A Rainbow,
pointing right back to home.

87
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,200
In that moment,
it all became clear.

88
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,860
I knew right then
just who I was supposed to be.

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,300
That's when this here
appeared.

90
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,930
I've been happily
working the farm ever since.

91
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,840
Ppbbhhtt!

92
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,330
There they are! Get back here,
you thievin' varmints!

93
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,540
Aww, that was
such a sweet story.

94
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,020
Sweet? Try sappy.

95
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,770
Come on, we've got to find
Rainbow Dash

96
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,680
And hear the cool way
to get a cutie mark.

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,220
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!

98
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,650
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!

99
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:46,730
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!

100
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,030
All right, little ones,
this way.

101
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,550
This way.

102
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,680
You really should be
more careful.

103
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,390
Somepony could get hurt.

104
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,410
Why are you
in such a hurry, anyway?

105
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,110
We're trying to find
Rainbow Dash

106
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,940
So we can hear how
she earned her cutie mark.

107
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,210
Oh? That would be
interesting.

108
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,410
You know, I wouldn't have gotten
my cutie mark

109
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,520
If it weren't for her.

110
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,920
Rainbow Dash?
Really?

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,680
Oh, yes. It all started
at summer flight camp.

112
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,580
You'd never guess,
but when I was little,

113
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,420
I was very shy
and a very weak flyer.

114
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,630
Ooh!

115
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,370
Ooh!

116
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,420
Aah! Yah!

117
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,170
Oh!

118
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,160
Nice going, cluttershy.

119
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,250
They ought to ground you
permanently.

120
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,330
Ha! My baby brother
can fly better than you.

121
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,400
It was the most humiliating
moment of my life.

122
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,180
And then,
out of nowhere...

123
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,690
leave her alone!

124
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,980
Ooh, what are you gonna do,
Rainbow crash?

125
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,610
Keep making fun of her
and find out!

126
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,420
You think
you're such a big shot?

127
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,790
Why don't you prove it?

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,410
What do you
have in mind?

129
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,950
You're going down.

130
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,530
In history maybe.

131
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,150
See you boys
at the finish line.

132
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,610
Ah, ah, aah!

133
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,840
Yaah!

134
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,910
Ah! Aah!

135
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,450
Huh?

136
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,920
I had never seen
such beautiful creatures.

137
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,590
Butterflies don't fly as high
as my cloud home,

138
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,980
And I had never been
near the ground before.

139
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,800
* what is this place
filled with so many wonders *

140
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,350
* casting its spell
that I am now under? *

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,960
* squirrels in the trees
and the cute little bunnies *

142
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,750
* birds flying free
and bees with their honey *

143
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,780
* hone-E-E-E-Y

144
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,640
* oh, what a magical place

145
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,660
* and I owe it all
to the pegasus race *

146
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,730
* if I knew that ground
had so much up its sleeve *

147
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,840
* I'd have come here sooner
and never leave *

148
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:38,810
* yes, I love
everyth-I-I-I-Ing *

149
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,520
Shh.

150
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,700
It's okay.

151
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,960
You can come out.

152
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,590
Everything's okay.

153
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,290
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

154
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,540
Somehow, I had the ability

155
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,470
To communicate with the animals
on a different level.

156
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,890
Wait, wait, wait.
What happened to Rainbow Dash?

157
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,170
What about the race?

158
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,810
Oh, well,
I wasn't there,

159
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,910
So I don't really know
what happened.

160
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,270
Come on, crusaders.
We've got to find her.

161
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,980
Besides, I can't take
any more singing.

162
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,040
Maybe my sister knows
where she is.

163
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,290
Bye, Fluttershy!

164
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,820
Bye, girls.

165
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,090
How did we
get roped into this?

166
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,560
We'll never hear
Rainbow Dash's story.

167
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,820
Are you girls still obsessing
over your cutie marks?

168
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,800
Of course.

169
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,980
Most of the fillies at school
already have theirs.

170
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,000
I know how you feel.

171
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,070
For the longest time,

172
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,180
I couldn't figure out
why I didn't have mine.

173
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,070
Well done, Rarity.
Your costumes are very nice.

174
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,240
Nice?!
They need to be spectacular!

175
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,610
And the performance
is tomorrow!

176
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,020
I tried every trick
I could think of,

177
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,630
But nothing seemed to work.

178
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,550
The costumes just weren't right,
and the play opened that night.

179
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,130
Maybe I'm not meant to be
a fashionista after all.

180
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,630
Aah!

181
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,940
What's going on?!

182
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,410
I had no idea
where my horn was taking me,

183
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,040
But unicorn magic doesn't happen
without a reason.

184
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,490
I knew this had to do
with my love of fashion --

185
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,440
And maybe even my cutie mark!

186
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,140
I knew that
this was my destiny!

187
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,040
A rock?!

188
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,720
That's my destiny?!

189
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,520
What is your problem, horn?!

190
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,480
I followed you all the way
out here for a rock?!

191
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,620
Hmph!
Dumb rock!

192
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,540
Aah!

193
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,850
Ooh!

194
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,470
Whoa!
Whoa!Whoa!
Whoa!

195
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,530
Ugh!
These namby-Pamby stories

196
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,970
Aren't getting us any closer
to our cutie marks!

197
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
They're all about finding
who you really are

198
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,060
And boring stuff
like that!

199
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,990
Yes, Scootaloo,
that's exactly --

200
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,070
Come on, girls,
we need action!

201
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,950
We need Rainbow Dash!

202
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,510
As a young filly in Canterlot,

203
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,290
I always wanted to go
to the Summer Sun Celebration,

204
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,590
Where princess Celestia
raises the sun.

205
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,200
And I saw the most amazing, most
wonderful thing I've ever seen.

206
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,870
I poured myself into learning
everything I could about magic.

207
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,090
My parents decided
to enroll me

208
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,290
In princess Celestia's
school for gifted unicorns.

209
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,230
It was a dream come true...

210
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,340
except for one thing.

211
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,890
I had to pass an entrance exam.

212
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,150
Well, miss Sparkle?

213
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,690
Well,
miss Sparkle?

214
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,090
We don't have
all day.

215
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,590
I knew it was the most important
day of my life,

216
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,920
That my entire future
would be affected

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,670
By the outcome of this day...

218
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,620
and I was about to blow it!

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,470
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

220
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,330
Aah!

221
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,730
Twilight Sparkle...

222
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,480
I'm so sorry.
I didn't --

223
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,410
...you have
a very special gift.

224
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,260
I don't think I've ever
come across

225
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,940
A unicorn
with your raw abilities.
Huh?

226
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,940
But you need to learn
to tame these abilities

227
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,970
Through focused study.

228
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,940
Huh?

229
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,230
Twilight Sparkle,
I'd like to make you

230
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,810
My own personal protégé
here at the school.

231
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,830
Huh?!

232
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,980
Well?

233
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,230
Yes!

234
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,910
One other thing,
Twilight.

235
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,730
More?

236
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,680
My cutie mark!

237
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes,

238
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,580
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes!

239
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,190
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!
Okay, okay.

240
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,090
We're happy for you,
Twilight.

241
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,440
Yeah, thrilled.

242
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,210
Let's get out of here
while we still can.

243
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,970
Yes, yes! Yes!

244
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,790
Are you okay?

245
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,130
Um...yes.

246
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,770
Aw, why don't we ever
smash into Rainbow Dash?

247
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,320
You're looking for
Rainbow Dash?

248
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,650
If I was her,
I'd be at sugar cube corner.

249
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,080
Of course, if I was anyone,
I'd be at sugar cube corner.

250
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,050
Hey!
I have an idea.

251
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,670
Want to go
to sugar cube corner?

252
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,280
Well, we're sort of looking
for Rainbow Dash

253
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,120
So we can hear
how she got her cutie mark.

254
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,110
Cutie mark!

255
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,140
Come with me, and I'll
tell you how I got mine.

256
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,580
Why not?

257
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,260
All right!

258
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,640
My sisters and i
were raised

259
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,910
On a rock farm
outside of Ponyville.

260
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,960
We spent our days
working the fields.

261
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,460
There was no talking.
There was no smiling.

262
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,470
There were only rocks.

263
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,040
We were in the south field,

264
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,150
Preparing to rotate the rocks
to the east field,

265
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,430
When all of a sudden...

266
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,330
I never felt joy
like that before.

267
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,970
It felt so good I just
wanted to keep smiling forever.

268
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,230
And I wanted
everyone I knew to smile, too.

269
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,550
But Rainbows don't come along
that often.

270
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,480
I wondered, how else
could I create some smiles?

271
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,180
We better harvest the rocks
from the south field.

272
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,760
Pinkamina Diane Pie,
is that you?

273
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,210
Ma, I need you and dad
and the sisters

274
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,530
To come in here quick!

275
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,970
Surprise!

276
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,610
Do you like it?
It's called a party.

277
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,190
Oh, you don't like it.

278
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,500
You like it!

279
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,860
I'm so happy!

280
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,940
And that's
how equestria was made.

281
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,930
Wha-- Huh?

282
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,490
Look, we're here.

283
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,610
Maybe
on the way home

284
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,610
I can tell you the story
of how I got my cutie mark.

285
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,280
It's a gem.

286
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,340
Oh, come on.
She's just being Pinkie Pie.

287
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:00,970
Ugh.

288
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,500
Rainbow Dash!
You're here!

289
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,100
I hear you're looking
for my cutie-Mark story.

290
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,060
You have no idea
what I've been through today

291
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,520
To hear that story.

292
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,320
It all happened
during the race at flight camp

293
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,560
Where I stood alone
against all odds

294
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,970
To defend
Fluttershy's honor.

295
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,870
Ah, ah, aah!

296
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,890
I'd never flown like that
before.

297
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,130
The freedom was unlike anything
I'd ever felt.

298
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,970
The speed, the adrenaline,
the wind in my mane!

299
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,320
I liked it a lot!

300
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,880
Whoa!

301
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,860
Ha!
Later, Rainbow crash.

302
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,740
Hey!

303
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,260
Turns out the only thing I liked
more than flying fast...

304
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,210
whoa-Oh-Oh!

305
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,680
...was winning.

306
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,000
Most people thought

307
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,590
That the sonic rainboom
was just an old mare's tail.

308
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,370
But that day,
the day I discovered racing,

309
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,890
I proved
that the legends were true.

310
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,870
I made the impossible happen.

311
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,070
And that, little ones,
is how you earn a cutie mark.

312
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,700
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

313
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,850
Wait a second.

314
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,660
I heard that explosion,
and I saw the Rainbow, too.

315
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,050
Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't
scared the animals,

316
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,890
I never would have learned
I could communicate with them

317
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,260
And gotten
my cutie mark.

318
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,870
I heard that boom,
and right afterwards,

319
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,070
There was this amazing Rainbow
that taught me to smile.

320
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,690
When I got my cutie mark,

321
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,020
I saw a Rainbow
that pointed me home.

322
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,860
I bet it was
your sonic rainboom.

323
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,150
There was an explosion
I could never explain

324
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,730
When I got my cutie mark.

325
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,070
This is uncanny.

326
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,260
If that explosion didn't happen
when it did,

327
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,120
I would have blown
my entrance exam.

328
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,010
Rainbow Dash, I think you helped
me earn my cutie mark, too!

329
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,620
Whoa!

330
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,450
We all owe
our cutie marks to you!

331
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,460
Do you realize
what this means?

332
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,720
All of us had a special
connection before we even met.

333
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,480
We've been BFFs forever,
and we didn't even know it!

334
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,080
Come here, y'all.

335
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,710
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

336
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,610
I love you guys.

337
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,090
Aww!
Aww!

338
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,610
Ew!
Give me a break.

339
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,730
Come on, crusaders.

340
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,040
Maybe we just need to try
zip-Lining again.

341
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,050
Hey,
how about a song?

342
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,210
Yes!
Definitely!

343
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,860
N-O-O-O-O-O!

344
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,770
Dear princess Celestia,

345
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,720
Today I learned
something amazing.

346
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,170
Everypony everywhere

347
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,690
Has a special magical connection
with her friends,

348
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,640
Maybe even
before she's met them.

349
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,160
If you're feeling lonely

350
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,300
And you're still searching
for your true friends,

351
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,060
Just look up in the sky.

352
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,970
Who knows? Maybe you
