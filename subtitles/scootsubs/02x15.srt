1
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:08,325
Who could that be?
It's still dark!

2
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:14,385
C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider
season's about to start!

3
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:23,465
Oh, where are we?
What's the rush?

4
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:26,185
The rush? Don't you remember
what happened last year?

5
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,285
Or the year before that?

6
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:29,895
Or pretty much any cider season ever?!

7
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,595
Um, well...

8
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:33,565
Pinkie Pie!

9
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:37,695
She always ends up ahead of us in line,
and then they always run out of cider!

10
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:40,445
- I guess I...
- Well not this year!

11
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:42,775
This year, I'm gonna get there before sunrise...

12
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:46,685
...so I can drink all the cider I want,
and laugh when she doesn't get any!

13
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,385
It's the perfect plan.

14
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:51,995
I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while...

15
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:54,775
...drinking it drop by drop in front of her...

16
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:00,115
Gee Rainbow Dash, it looks like a few
other ponies had the same idea.

17
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:06,475
Oh, gosh Pinkie, I love your new style.

18
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:08,975
Who are all these ponies?!

19
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,485
Isn't this great?

20
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:13,015
I couldn't sleep last night 'cause
I was so excited about cider season...

21
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:15,425
...and I had this brilliant idea
to come gather and camp out...

22
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:17,815
...so I told a few others about it and
they all thought it was a great idea too...

23
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:21,855
...and now it's just a big old cider party! Woohoo!

24
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:24,955
Oh gosh, that's a lot of ponies.

25
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:26,875
Hope they don't run out before you get any.

26
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:04,785

27
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:15,355
Isn't this exciting, Spike?

28
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,395
Opening day of cider season!

29
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:21,645
Yeah! That means it's only thirty
more days to sapphire season!

30
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:27,825
Attention, everypony! Cider
season is now officially open!

31
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:32,575
Sorry everypony!
That's it for today!

32
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:36,185
Surprise, surprise...

33
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,725
You ran out again!

34
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,665
Yeah, you always run out!

35
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,725
For the record, I don't mind...

36
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:44,355
Why can't you make enough cider for all of us?

37
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,965
Or at least for me!

38
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:55,015
Hold on everypony, we've done
our best to improve supply this year.

39
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,285
You always say that!

40
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,075
And it's always true.

41
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:03,155
But Apple family cider is made
with love and integrity...

42
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:06,235
...and only the highest quality apples in Equestria.

43
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,425
Sorry, but that recipe takes time.

44
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:16,785
If y'all just be patient, we'll
have plenty more tomorrow.

45
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:20,155
She's right, y'know!
You can't rush perfection!

46
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:22,885
And this year's batch was perfection!

47
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,485
Uh, Pinkie Pie...

48
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:27,235
I'll never forget the cider I just drank!

49
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:31,485
It was a moment in time that will never exist again...

50
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:46,245
What in Equestria is that?

51
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:09,025
Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine,
it's the same in every town

52
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,065
Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues,
and not a drop of cider to be found

53
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:17,115
Maybe they're not aware that there's
really no need for this teary despair

54
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:22,105
And the key that they need to solve the
sad cider shortage you and I will share

55
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:25,655
Well you've got opportunity

56
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:27,885
In this very community

We're the world famous Flim Flam brothers

Travelling salesponies nonpareil

60
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,085
Non-pa what?

61
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:41,835
Nonpareil, that's exactly the reason why, you see

62
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:45,295
Nopony else in this whole place will give you
such a chance to be where you need to be

63
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,535
And that's a new world, with tons of cider

64
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:50,655
Fresh squeezed and ready for drinking

65
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:54,555
More cider than you could drink
in all your days of thinking

66
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,855
I doubt that.

67
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,375
So take this opportunity

68
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,635

00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:13,015
I suppose by now you're wondering,
about our peculiar mode of transport

73
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:16,875
I say, our mode of locomotion

74
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:21,135
And I suppose by now you're wondering,
where is this promised cider?

75
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:24,875
Any horse can make a claim
and any pony can do the same

76
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,305
But my brother and I have something
most unique and superb

77
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:29,255
Unseen at any time in this great new world

78
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,345
And that's opportunity

79
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:37,175
Folks, the one and only, the biggest and the best

80
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:38,505
The unbelievable

81
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:39,605
Unimpeachable

82
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:40,505
Indispensable

83
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:41,705
I can't believe-able

Flim Flam brothers' Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000

85
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:49,145
What d'you say, sister?

86
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:51,175
Oh, we got opportunity

87
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:53,395
In this very community

88
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,725
Please Flim, please Flam, help us out of this jam

89
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:59,145
With the Flim Flam brothers'
Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000

90
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:02,745
Young filly, I would be ever so honored if
you might see fit to let my brother and I...

91
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,045
...borrow some of your delicious, and might I add...

92
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:08,395
...spell-bindingly fragrant apples for
our little demonstration here?

93
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,595
Uh, sure, I guess.

94
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,975
Opportunity, in our community

95
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,075
- Ready Flim?
- Ready Flam.

96
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,375
Let's bing-bang zam!

97
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:18,245
And show these thirsty ponies
a world of delectable cider!

98
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:22,095
Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider...

99
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,995
Watch closely, my friends!

100
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:27,015
The fun begins!

101
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:28,595
Now, here's where the magic happens.

102
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:32,035
Right here in this heaving roiling cider
press boiling guts of the very machine...

103
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,195
...those apples plucked fresh are right now as we speak...

104
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:38,795
...being turned into grade-A top-notch five-star
blow-your-horses-off one-of-a-kind cider!

105
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:42,335
Feel free to take a sneak peek!

106
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,495
Now wait, you fellas, hold it!

107
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,485
You went and over-sold it!

108
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:49,765
I guarantee that what you have there won't compare

109
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:52,425
For the very most important ingredient

110
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:54,625
Can't be added or done expedient

111
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:58,025
And it's quality, friends, Apple Acre's quality and care!

112
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:02,445
Well Granny, I'm glad you brought that up,
my dear, I say I'm glad you brought that up

113
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:06,555
You see that we are very picky when
it comes to cider if you'll kindly try a cup

114
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:10,915
Yes, sir, yes ma'am this great machine,
it's just the very best

115
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,055
So whaddaya say then, Apples

116
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,205
Care to step into the modern world

117
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:20,505
And put the Super Speedy Cider
Squeezy 6000 to the test?

118
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:23,445
What do you think, folks?
Do you see what the Apples can't?

119
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:26,785
I see it clear as day!
I know she does! So does he!

120
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:29,545
C'mon Ponyville, you know
what I'm talking about!

121
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,465
We're saying you've got

122
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:32,865
Opportunity

123
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:35,165
In this very community

124
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,385
He's Flim, he's Flam

125
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:39,005
We're the world famous Flim Flam brothers

126
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:46,045
Traveling salesponies nonpareil

127
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:47,835
Yeah!

128
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:50,125
You got a deal!

129
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,365
Not so fast!

130
00:08:55,275 --> 00:09:00,165
No way no how that machine matches up
with the care we put in our cider!

131
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:04,495
But if it really does work, we could
make everypony in town happy!

132
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:08,695
I just don't know, y'all. We've
always made cider the same way.

133
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:09,995
Eeyup.

134
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:13,955
We'll sweeten the deal.
You supply the apples...

135
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:17,985
We supply the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.

136
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:20,255
Then we split those sweet sweet profits...

137
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,225
Seventy five...
- Twenty five.

138
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:22,935
Deal!

139
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:25,255
Hold on, who gets the seventy five?

140
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,045
Why us, naturally.

141
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:31,255
And, we'll throw in the magic
to power the machine for free.

142
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:35,555
Cider sales keep our business
afloat through the winter.

143
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:38,215
We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.

144
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:40,735
So? What'll it be?

145
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:42,295
No deal.

146
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:46,435
Very well, if you refuse our
generous offer to be partners...

147
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,835
...then we'll just have to be competitors.

148
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,575
You wouldn't dare.

149
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:51,675
Oh no?

150
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:58,305
Don't you worry, everypony!
There'll be plenty of cider for all of you!

151
00:09:58,305 --> 00:10:01,635
Once we drive Sweet Apple Acres out of business.

152
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:20,315
Still worried about Flim and Flam?

153
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,915
Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.

154
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,275
I'm not so sure.

155
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:27,595
They sounded mighty serious when they
threatened to run us out of business.

156
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:29,865
That's it! Last cup!

157
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:32,215
Oh for Pete's sake!

158
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,675
C'mon back tomorrow, everypony!

159
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:36,385
*Tomorrow?*

160
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,115
What seems to be the problem here?

161
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:50,235
Oh my oh my, out of cider again?

162
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:54,545
What have we here?
Who'd like a cup?

163
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:04,685
Don't worry, everypony, we've got the Super Speedy
Cider Squeezy 6000 to make more in an instant!

164
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:10,615
You can't sell that cider!

165
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:14,075
That's made from Apple family apples!

166
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,855
Is this some kind of cruel joke?

167
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:20,645
Don't worry, everypony, there are
plenty of apples in Equestria.

168
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:24,845
We'll find some others and make more
cider than all of Ponyville can drink!

169
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:28,925
We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine!

170
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:36,095
Now, it ain't about the speed,
young'un, it's about quality.

171
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,605
Who cares how good the cider is,
if I never get to drink any?

172
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:44,565
Oh, look at these poor, dissatisfied ponies.

173
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:47,575
Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country!

174
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,545
Our cider speaks for itself!

175
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:52,545
Let's put it to the test!

176
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:55,035
Anywhere, anytime!

177
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,105
Well, that's enough, now.

178
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:03,725
With our machine, we can make enough cider
in one hour to satisfy this entire town!

179
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,045
We'll do it in 45 minutes!

180
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:11,085
Easy, Apple Bloom, easy.

181
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:14,505
What's the matter, Granny Smith? Chicken?

182
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,005
What did you call me, sonny?

183
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:20,885
If you're so confident in your cider,
then what's the problem?

184
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:23,405
Tomorrow mornin', right here!

185
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:27,565
But I'm afraid we haven't any... apples.

186
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:29,975
You can use our south field...

187
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:33,455
...and it'd be worth it to teach you
all a thing or two about cider making!

188
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:35,365
Excellent, we have a bet.

189
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:41,065
Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour,
wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville.

190
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:50,005
And after we beat ya, I don't never want to
see you bimbahoozalers around here again!

191
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:53,265
Until... tomorrow.

192
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,485
Don't worry, Applejack,
I know you'll win tomorrow!

193
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:03,595
We'd better, 'cause if we don't,
we're gonna lose our farm!

194
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,285
Applejack? Are you sure
this is such a good idea?

195
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:24,065
Me and the family are...
a hundred percent confident...

196
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:26,555
...in our cider making capabilities.

197
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,375
And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken.

198
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:33,765
Attention everypony!

199
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:35,185
Well, good luck.

200
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,725
Thanks Twilight.

201
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:40,135
We'll need it.

202
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:44,335
The teams have one hour to produce
as much cider as they can.

203
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:46,735
After which, the barrels will be counted...

204
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:52,885
...and the winner will be named the
sole cider provider for all of Ponyville!

205
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:56,555
Are both teams ready?

206
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:01,905
Ready!

207
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,365
Ready!

208
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:05,895
Then let's...

209
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:08,925
...go!

210
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:26,375
Bad 'un. Good 'un!
Bad 'un...

211
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:37,465
Great job, y'all!
We've already filled an entire barrel!

212
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:40,125
I'll bet you those guys don't even have...

213
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:06,445
C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus!

214
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:09,285
We gotta forget those guys if we're
gonna have a chance of winnin'!

215
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:13,725
Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny,
we're fallin' behind!

216
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:19,085
Good 'un... bad 'un...

217
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,355
Rest when it's over, Big Macintosh!

218
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,475
Ride! Ride!

219
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:29,525
This is just dreadful.

220
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:33,905
Even at top speed, the Apples are only
making one barrel to the twins' three!

221
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:43,845
Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members
allowed to help in the competition?

222
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,445
Well, I'm not sure...

223
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:51,155
Flim, Flam, would you object to
honorary family members helping?

224
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:53,255
Are you kidding?

225
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:56,655
We don't care if the whole
kingdom of Canterlot helps.

226
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,735
It's a lost cause.

227
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:03,455
I guess it's okay.
Applejack? What do you think?

228
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:07,785
I think I'd love to have the
rest of my family helpin' out.

229
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,635
All right!

230
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:16,425
Okay everypony, we're not gonna let those
smooth talkers take our friend's farm.

231
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:17,625
Yeah!

232
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:20,955
Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees.

233
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:21,955
Got it.

234
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:24,685
Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail.

235
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,485
Yes sir, ma'am, sir!

236
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:28,745
Rarity, you've got a discerning eye.

237
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,075
Help Granny Smith at the quality control station.

238
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,075
Of course.

239
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:35,085
Rainbow Dash, do you think you
can help Big Macintosh press?

240
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,285
In my sleep!

241
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:39,855
Alright everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!

242
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,255
All right!

243
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,985
Over there, Apple Bloom!
Don't miss them!

244
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,835
Right behind you, Pinkie Pie!

245
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,965
Good 'un, bad 'un, bad 'un, good 'un...

246
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:59,175
Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely...

247
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,855
Based on these figures, we're making
five barrels for every three of theirs!

248
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:15,285
Keep it up, everypony!
We're back in this!

249
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:19,355
Come on, brother, we've gotta pick up the pace!

250
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,535
Right, double the power!

251
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:33,925
We gotta try something else!

252
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:36,835
I've got it, brother of mine.

253
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:44,315
Well done, Flam!
We're at top productivity!

254
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:49,525
C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!

255
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:53,035
We don't have time for quality control,
if we wanna win this thing!

256
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:58,935
Get back, you!
One bad apple spoils the bunch!

257
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:00,585
Applejack, help me!

258
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:03,345
There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!

259
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,175
We'll just have to work harder!

260
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:06,615
C'mon, everypony!

261
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:09,725
All right then, double time!

262
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:37,285
Time's up!

263
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,975
I'm proud of you, Applejack.

264
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,275
Thanks.

265
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:51,085
Integrity like that, will always be... rewarded.

266
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:53,925
Flim and Flam win!

267
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:59,765
We... lost?

268
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:02,595
Too bad, Apples.

269
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:08,185
Guess you'll just have to find a new line of work
that doesn't match your names quite so... perfectly.

270
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:12,145
Now should we tear down all these tacky
old buildings and put up new ones, brother?

271
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:14,335
I don't see why not, brother.

272
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:18,025
After all, this isn't Sweet Apple Acres anymore.

273
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:22,185
How about 'Flim Flam Fields'?

274
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:25,035
I ought to press you into jerk cider!

275
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:28,665
No, Rainbow Dash.
A deal's a deal.

276
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:33,685
Congratulations to y'all.

277
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:38,125
The cider business in Ponyville... is yours.

278
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,845
C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things.

279
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:47,905
Fear not, everypony. There's more
than enough cider to go around.

280
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,285
Go ahead, everypony.

281
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:57,205
Go on, y'all. It's okay.

282
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:04,835
Drink up, Ponyville!
Down the hatch!

283
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:11,605
I can't get the taste off my tongue!

284
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:13,405
Mine's got rocks in it.

285
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:16,465
I wouldn't pay one cent for this dreck!

286
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,555
You wouldn't pay even one cent?

287
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:20,555
No!

288
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:25,075
How about two cups for one cent?

289
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:26,075
No!

290
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,405
Two bits for a barrel?

291
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:30,605
No!

292
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:34,525
It looks like we've encountered a slight...

293
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,825
...problem here, in Ponyville.

294
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,635
Nopony wants our product. Next town?

295
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:40,735
Next town.

296
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,655
- Let's go, Flim!
- Let's go, Flam!

297
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:50,115
They're gone.

298
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,295
That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!

299
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,765
Plus we can have high quality Apple family cider!

300
00:20:56,765 --> 00:20:58,785
Because of this silly competition...

301
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:01,695
...we've made enough of our
cider for the whole town!

302
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,825
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

303
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,375
"...I wanted to share my thoughts with you. "

304
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:15,395
"I didn't learn anythin'!
I was right all along!"

305
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:20,105
"If you take your time to do things the
right way, your work will speak for itself."

306
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:24,415
"Sure, I could tell you I learned something about
how my friends are always there to help me..."

307
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,335
"...and I can count on them no matter what..."

308
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:29,965
"...but truth is, I knew that already too."
