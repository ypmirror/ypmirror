1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,570
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,700
Ooh-whee!

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,700
Not a bad pitch

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,830
for a pony who works
with her head in the clouds.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,830
Oh, yeah?

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,950
Think you can do better,
cowgirl?

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,250
I know I can.

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,130
Oh, for Pete's sake.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,340
Heh!

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,800
Looks like this pegasus can
pitch better than the workhorse.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,840
The object of the game is
to get the closest to the stake.

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,510
All right, all right.

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,260
You got another throw there,
pony girl.

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,600
Wow, Rainbow.

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,850
You couldn't hit a barn door
with that kind of a throw.

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,810
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,650
I still have the closest throw,
apple smack.

18
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,150
Just try and beat it.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,240
Yee-haw!
It's a ringer.

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,250
That's how we do it
down here on the farm.

21
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,250
I lost.

22
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,580
Don't feel bad, rainbow.
It's all in good fun.

23
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,750
I hate losing.

24
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,840
Besides, you're
a mighty good athlete.

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm just better.

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,170
All right, Applejack.

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,880
You think you're the top athlete
in all of Ponyville?

28
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,100
Well, I was gonna say
"in all of Equestria,"

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,010
But that might be
gilding the lily.

30
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,890
And I think I'm the top athlete,
so let's prove it.

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,850
Prove what?

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,730
I challenge you
to an ironpony competition.

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,280
A series
of athletic contests

34
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,030
to decide who's the best
once and for all.

35
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,740
You know what, Rainbow?
You're on.

36
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,080
* My Little Pony

37
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,910
* My Little Pony

38
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,880
Regular subtitles
by YayPonies
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,920
* My Little Pony

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,250
* I used to wonder
What friendship could be *

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,920
* My Little Pony

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,720
* Until you all shared
This magic with me *

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,800
* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,930
* A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong *

45
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,640
* Sharing kindness
* It's an easy feat

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,890
* And magic
Makes it all complete *

47
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,140
* Yeah, My Little Pony

48
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,190
* Do you know you're all
My very best friends? *

49
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,370
So, you two
are doing what, now?

50
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,410
An iron--

51
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,250
Ironpony competition!

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,790
See, we've set up
a bunch of events

53
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,500
To decide
which one of us is --

54
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,590
The most athletic
pony ever!

55
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,590
And I'm here to...

56
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,220
uh...I don't know.

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,640
Why is she here?

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,600
To be our judge
and keep score.

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,260
Right. Heh!

60
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,600
Somepony's got to record
my awesomeness

61
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,890
for the history books.

62
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,610
Hello, everypony!

63
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,440
and welcome to the first annual
Ironpony competition!

64
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,610
Uh, Spike,
who are you talking to?

65
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,490
Um...them!

66
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,240
Let the games begin!

67
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,450
Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!

68
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,630
Ready, set, go!

69
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,430
Dag nabbit.

70
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,680
Time, Spike?

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,640
17 seconds.
You're kidding.

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,600
That breaks my record
from last year's rodeo.

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,390
But you got a 5-seconds penalty
for nudging the barrel.

74
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,940
Nuts and shoes!

75
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,230
Still, that's 22 seconds.
Not too shabby.

76
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,950
Hey, don't be nervous.
Remember, it's all in good fun.

77
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,570
Now, get on up there.

78
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,660
Ready, set, go!

79
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,290
Whew!

80
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,670
That was some fancy hoofwork
there, Rainbow.

81
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,250
Thanks, but I couldn't have been
as fast as you.

82
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,840
What was the time
on that, Spike?

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,800
18 seconds.

84
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,930
18 seconds?

85
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,350
Rainbow, are you sure you're not
secretly a rodeo pony?

86
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,930
Rainbow Dash
wins the barrel weave.

87
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,640
I can't believe I won.

88
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,860
Yeah, well, don't you
go getting used to it.

89
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,990
Mighty respectable.

90
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,870
But let me show you
how it's really done.

91
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,290
Years
of apple-bucking.

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,420
Whoo-hoo!
Yup!

93
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,550
Why me?

94
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,550
Go!

95
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,800
Whoa!

96
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,300
Whoa!

97
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,430
Whoa-oh!

98
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,600
Whoa!

99
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,890
Wh-o-o-oa!

100
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,930
Ouch.

101
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,020
Ready for
another pony ride?

102
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,020
No!

103
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,900
Go!

104
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,780
G-G-G-G-G-whoa!

105
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,320
Rainbow Dash
wins the bronco buck.

106
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,660
...and I lose.

107
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,040
Whoa!

108
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,500
How do I get roped
into these things?

109
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,050
Does this count?

110
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,400
Pbht!

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,590
Fillies and gentlecolts,

112
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,970
at the halfway point, our
competitors are tied at 5 and 5.

113
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,800
Who are you
talking to?

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,850
Them!

115
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,940
95.

116
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,810
96.

117
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,770
97.

118
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,820
98.

119
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,990
99...

120
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,490
100.

121
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,860
Yes!

122
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,910
Be a good sport,
Applejack.

123
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,530
All right, you two,
this is the final event.

124
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,700
Give it all you've got.

125
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,580
Looks like the workhorse might
come out ahead in this one.

126
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,040
That's not fair.

127
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,880
You can't use your wings
to help you win.

128
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Huh?

129
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,630
You're cheating.

130
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,880
I can't understand you
with that rope in your mouth.

131
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,930
I said --

132
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,930
Uh-oh.

133
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,810
Whoo-hoo!
I win by a landslide.

134
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,900
Or mudslide, in your case.

135
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,030
I am the ironpony!

136
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,070
Only 'cause
you cheated!

137
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,490
What?!

138
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,950
You used your wing power

139
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,780
To help you win
over half those contests.

140
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,910
Sounds like
sour apples to me.

141
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,750
Are you saying
you didn't use your wings?

142
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,620
Well, no, but you never said
I couldn't use my wings.

143
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,710
I didn't think I needed
to tell you to play fair.

144
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,760
I still would have won
even without my wings.

145
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Ha! Prove it!

146
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,880
Gladly! How?

147
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,090
Tomorrow's the annual
Running of the Leaves.

148
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,680
I challenge you
to race me in it.

149
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,180
Ha! Easy-shmeasy.

150
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,810
Hold on!

151
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,850
There is one condition.

152
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,570
The point is to run,
so no wings allowed.

153
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,690
No wings?

154
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,780
Aah!

155
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,940
No problem.

156
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,950
Pbht!

157
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,170
Twilight, hurry up.

158
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,090
We're gonna be late
for the race.

159
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,170
Why are you so excited
about the race?

160
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,260
It's only for ponies.

161
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,840
Yeah, but I'm hoping
I can be the announcer again.

162
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Just listen.

163
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,720
Fillies and gentlecolts,

164
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,680
Welcome to the annual
Running of the --

165
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,930
Welcome to the annual
Running of the Leaves!

166
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,930
This is Pinkie Pie,

167
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,520
Your official
"puh-ie-in-the-sky" announcer.

168
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,110
Sorry, Spike, I guess
that job's already taken.

169
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,530
As everypony knows, the run
is a very important tradition,

170
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,570
for without it,

171
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,070
the autumn leaves of Equestria
would never fall.

172
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,200
So get ready, ponies.

173
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,740
The Running of the Leaves
will begin in five minutes.

174
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,050
Pardon me! Excuse me!
Make way for the ironpony!

175
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,170
The iron phony,
you mean.

176
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,970
So, Applejack,
you ready to win...

177
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,140
second place?

178
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,810
I'm ready to run
a good, clean race.

179
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,140
Yeah, yeah.

180
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,770
You are not
allowed to use your wings.

181
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,270
I can win this race with
both wings tied behind my back.

182
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,440
Trussed up like a turkey --

183
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,990
Well, a turkey
who can't fly, that is.

184
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,030
Very funny.

185
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,200
At least now we know
we're racing fair and square.

186
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,080
Racers,
please take your positions!

187
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,290
Um, Pinkie Pie?

188
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,960
Hey, Spike! What's up?

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,880
Oh, wait -- It's me!
I'm up!

190
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,960
Uh, yeah, uh,

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,090
I know you're doing the
announcing today and stuff,

192
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,470
and I'm sure you're gonna do
a great job and all,

193
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,090
but I was just
wondering...

194
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,010
What?

195
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,140
Uh, forget it.

196
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,020
Spike, would you like to be
my co-reporter?

197
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,190
We could comment
on the action together.

198
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,980
We could?

199
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,310
Climb on up.

200
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,980
Twilight?

201
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,280
What in tarnation
are you doing up here?

202
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,110
I'm racing.

203
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,950
Good one, Twilight.

204
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,290
I'm not joking.

205
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,950
What?!
You're not an athlete.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,040
You're an --
Well, you're an egghead.

207
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,500
I am not an egghead.
I am well-read.

208
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,500
Egghead.

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,130
But h-have you ever
run a race?

210
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,100
Well, no. But I do know
a lot about running.

211
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,930
And you
know this from...

212
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,390
Books. I've read
several on the subject.

213
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,230
What'd you read --

214
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,980
"The Egghead's Guide
to Running"?

215
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,280
Did you stretch out
your eye muscles to warm up?

216
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,990
Get it?
Eye muscles?

217
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,490
Scoff if you must,
Rainbow,

218
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,410
But the Running of the Leaves
is a Ponyville tradition.

219
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,160
And since
I'm here to learn,

220
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,500
I've decided I should
experience it myself.

221
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,830
Well, I think
that's just dandy, Twilight.

222
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Good luck.

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,880
Yeah.

224
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,460
See you
at the finish line...

225
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,010
tomorrow!

226
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,850
All right, ponies.
Are you ready?

227
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,060
Get set...

228
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,390
And they're off!

229
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,270
Welcome
to the official coverage

230
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,980
of the Running
of the Leaves.

231
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,900
You know, Spike,
despite its name,

232
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,190
the leaves don't do
any of the actual running.

233
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,240
No, that's left
to my little ponies.

234
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,240
Why, yes, Pinkie.

235
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,990
It's the running
of the ponies

236
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,870
that causes
the leaves to fall.

237
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,290
Oh, those
lazy, lazy leaves.

238
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,920
But this year, the run is about
more than the weather.

239
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,380
It's about
the race to the finish

240
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,210
and the two runners
who want to win it --

241
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,460
Applejack
and Rainbow Dash.

242
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,260
You know, Pinkie,
these two ponies

243
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,930
have a bit of a grudge match
they're trying to settle,

244
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,930
trying to prove
who's the most athletic.

245
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,930
Yes, and "grudge"
rhymes with "fudge."

246
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,180
Yes, it...does.

247
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,180
What?

248
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,560
And I like fudge,
but if I eat too much fudge,

249
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,310
I get a pudge,
and then I can't budge.

250
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,150
So, no fudge?

251
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,270
Uh, no, thanks.
I had a big breakfast.

252
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,940
Let's check in with
our two competitive ponies,

253
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,530
Applejack
and Rainbow Dash.

254
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,610
Having come
fast out of the gate,

255
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,370
Applejack
and Rainbow Dash

256
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,330
are evenly matched,
running neck and neck.

257
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,290
But what's this?
Applejack is making a move.

258
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,580
She's now ahead
by a nose.

259
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,580
But Rainbow Dash
won't let Applejack have it

260
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,460
and takes the lead.

261
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,040
She's ahead
by half a nose.

262
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,500
Or maybe
three-quarters of a nose!

263
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,920
No, about
63.7% of a nose!

264
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,460
...roughly speaking.

265
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,260
Applejack sees this move
and plunges forth

266
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,010
with her strong, workhorse legs,
leaping ahead by 350 noses!

267
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,350
Not so easy
without wings, is it?

268
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,190
Come on, Rainbow.
Show 'em a little dash.

269
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,020
H-hold your horses,
Pinkie.

270
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,110
Rainbow Dash is catching up
to front-runner Applejack.

271
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,530
What an upset!

272
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,700
I thought Applejack
had this in the bag.

273
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,280
You didn't think i
was gonna let you off
that easy, did you?

274
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,660
Whoa!

275
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,540
I don't believe it.

276
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,290
I know.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

277
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,260
Not the scenery,
Twilight.

278
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,130
Rainbow Dash
just tripped me.

279
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,220
She did not.

280
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,340
She did, too!

281
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,340
She did not.

282
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,640
And if you slowed down

283
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,220
and looked
where you're going, like me,

284
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,390
you'd see that you tripped
over a rock.

285
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,600
What?
Oh, hayseed!

286
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,480
Now I've got a lot of ground
to make up to catch Rainbow.

287
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,980
Just be careful!

288
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,290
See you
at the finish line!

289
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,410
I don't believe it!

290
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,710
After a huge setback,

291
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,120
Applejack is back
at the front of the pack.

292
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,210
She's the head of the pack,
all right,

293
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,420
the pick of the litter,
the cat's pajamas!

294
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,420
Oh, wait.

295
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,130
Why would Applejack take
some poor kitty's P.J.s?

296
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,680
That's not
very sporting of her.

297
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,680
Okay...

298
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,010
Let's get back
to the race.

299
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,680
Not so fast, Applejack!
This race isn't over yet!

300
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,270
It is for you. Heh!

301
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,190
Whoa!

302
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,960
I don't believe it!
Applejack tripped me!

303
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,960
Don't you ponies

304
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,130
ever look
where you're going?

305
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,040
You tripped
on a stump. See?

306
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,370
Oh, I see.
A big cheater is what I see.

307
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,580
Rainbow, Applejack
would never cheat.

308
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,090
It was just an accident.

309
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,290
Sure it was.

310
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,050
I mean, yeah.
I'm sure it was.

311
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,130
Remember, Rainbow,
this is just a game.

312
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,050
Yes, but the rules
have changed.

313
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,470
And two can play
at that game.

314
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,440
Welcome back, Ponyvillians.
It's me -- Pinkie Pie.

315
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
And Spike.

316
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,740
Looks like Rainbow's
doing her best to catch up.

317
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,530
I'm not sure how
"ketchup" is gonna help
her in this contest.

318
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,910
Now, in a
hot-dog-eating contest,

319
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,780
It can make them doggies
nice and slippery.

320
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,410
But personally,
I prefer mustard.

321
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,700
How about you, Spike?

322
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,410
Uh...I like pickles?

323
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,420
And...it looks like

324
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,040
Applejack has found herself
in quite a pickle,

325
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,550
as Rainbow overtakes her.

326
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,670
Look, ma. No wings.

327
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,970
As the racers enter
Equestria's Whitetail Wood,

328
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,340
Rainbow Dash
is back in the lead.

329
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,940
Hey! Rainbow!

330
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,730
Pbht!

331
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,940
Why, that little cheater
did that on purpose!

332
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,940
It's on!

333
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,910
Nice one, Rainbow.
Later!

334
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,410
Argh!

335
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,960
A-a-a-ah!

336
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,410
Oh, my. Whitetail Wood
is just lovely.

337
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,170
Hey, Rainbow.
Shouldn't you be up ahead?

338
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,420
I'm sure to win now.

339
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,090
Except that all the other racers
just passed you.

340
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,470
Oh, horse apples.
See ya!

341
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,430
Applejack,
what are you doing up here?

342
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,060
There aren't even any trees.

343
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,480
I know, but the signs
pointed this way.

344
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,600
Rainbow!

345
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,020
Mind giving me a lift?

346
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,990
What the hay?
You said no flying!

347
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,160
No, I said no wings.

348
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,830
I must say, Spike,
that this has been

349
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,830
The most interesting
Running of the Leaves
in Equestria history.

350
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,500
Or the most interesting
announcing.

351
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,130
But it isn't the running
that's been fascinating --

352
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,130
It's the
lack of running.

353
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,930
Whaa!

354
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,740
Wh-o-o-oa!

355
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,490
Whoa!

356
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,670
Whoa!
Whoa!

357
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,920
Forgive me, girls.

358
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,550
I know I'm not an athlete,

359
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,760
But shouldn't
the Running of the Leaves

360
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,560
actually involve...
running?

361
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,680
You know,
I think Twilight's right.

362
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,680
You do?

363
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,520
Yeah.

364
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,850
If you want to beat me,
you better...

365
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,770
run!

366
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,070
once again,
Rainbow Dash and Applejack

367
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,110
are neck and neck,
jockeying for position.

368
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,780
Applejack inches ahead.
Now it's Rainbow.

369
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,950
It's Applejack.
It's Rainbow Dash.

370
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,620
It's Applejack!

371
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,920
Oh, no, she didn't!

372
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,540
Oh, yes, she did!

373
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,880
Cut it out!

374
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,170
No, you cut it out!

375
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,880
You started it.

376
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,970
And now
I'm gonna finish it.

377
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,260
Oh, no, you won't!

378
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,020
Oh, yes, I will!

379
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,690
That's it!
All bets are off!

380
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,780
Oh, no, you don't!

381
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,990
Hey! Quit it!
No! Uhh!

382
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,950
It's Applejack!
It's Rainbow Dash!

383
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,250
It's Applejack!
It's Rainbow Dash!

384
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,790
I won!

385
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,000
No! I won!

386
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,010
I won!

387
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,590
You tied!

388
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,840
Tied?
Tied?

389
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,840
For first?

390
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,180
For last!

391
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
Last?!

392
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,010
Then who won?

393
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,980
You?!
You?!

394
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,270
Oh, no, but I did get 5th place,
which is rather good,

395
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,020
considering
I've never run a race before.

396
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,820
What?
How is that
even possible?

397
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,190
You ran so slow
and looked at the scenery!

398
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,030
Exactly. I paced myself,
just like my book said.

399
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,330
Then at the end, when all
the other ponies were worn out,

400
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,790
I sprinted to the finish.

401
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,710
I don't believe it.
Twilight beat us!

402
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,920
Well, with
all your horsing around,

403
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,050
it was quite easy.

404
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,590
You're right,
Twilight.

405
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,340
Our behavior
was just terrible.

406
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,300
We weren't
very good sports.

407
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,010
Sounds to me

408
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,760
like an important lesson
was learned.

409
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,770
Princess Celestia?!
Princess Celestia?!

410
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,930
What are you
doing here?

411
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,900
Fall is one of my
favorite seasons,

412
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,560
So I came to celebrate
the Running of the Leaves.

413
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,110
I'm sorry
you had to see us

414
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,030
being such poor sports,
princess.

415
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,820
That's all right,
Applejack.

416
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,990
Anypony can get swept up in
the excitement of competition.

417
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,700
It's important to remember
that the friendship

418
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,660
is always more important
that the competition.

419
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,330
Exactly, Twilight.

420
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,370
Now, unfortunately,

421
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,170
because the two of you
were busy tricking each other

422
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,040
instead of
shaking down leaves,

423
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,010
many of the lovely trees
in Equestria are still covered.

424
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,130
Why, princess, I bet

425
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,010
we can knock those leaves down
for you lickety-split.

426
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,100
What do you say, friend?
Want to go for another run?

427
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,140
I'd love
to stretch my legs.

428
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,700
* My Little Pony

429
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,870
* My Little Pony

430
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,670
* My Little Pony

431
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,090
* Friends
