1
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:07,615
Yeah!

2
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:17,305
Who?

3
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:21,325
Oh. It's you, Owlowiscious.
Come on! Try and keep up.

4
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:39,625
Winona? I mean...

5
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,055
Winona's head?

6
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:44,685
Um... Is this weird or is it just me?

7
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:49,665
Angel?! Gummy?!

8
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:54,905
Okay. This is officially beyond weird now
and moved right on down to freakytown.

9
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:07,625
Sincerest apologies, Rainbow,
if our pets were bothering you.

10
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,695
Say you're sorry, Opal.

11
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:12,145
She's sorry.

12
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:14,205
What are you all doing out here?

13
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:18,555
Why, we always round up our critters for
our regular pony pet playdate in this park.

14
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,995
Uh... You do?

15
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,955
Same time every week.

16
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:26,095
I thought you knew.
You didn't know? She didn't know?

17
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:30,045
Well, we initially planned on inviting
Rainbow, of course, except...

18
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,955
We were totally gonna
invite you, Rainbow.

19
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:33,695
Then Twilight remembered that
you don't even have a pet.

20
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,185
And Rarity remembered that you really
like taking naps in the afternoon.

21
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:38,625
So Applejack figured you wouldn't
missing out on anything anyway.

22
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,215
And Fluttershy and I nodded
our heads in agreement like this.

23
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:44,185
Oh... Please don't be mad at us.

24
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:46,365
Oh... I'm not mad.

25
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:49,755
You all are right. Not much point
of a pony pet playdate for me...

26
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:51,765
...if I'm a pony without a pet, right?

27
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,055
Exactly.

28
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:54,825
So, if'n you'll excuse us...

29
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,755
Hey! Now wait a minute.

30
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,695
Just because I don't have a pet now
doesn't mean I never want a pet.

31
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:16,695
Oh! Oh, really?
You really want a pet? Really?

32
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:19,125
Cause I've got so many
wonderful choices at my house.

33
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,175
Oh, and I know you'll just love them.

34
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:22,665
And they'll love you! Oh!

35
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:25,265
And you'll be best friends
forever and ever!

36
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:36,515
<i>Now, Rainbow, my dear,
I cannot express my delight.</i>

37
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,155
<i>It's abundantly clear
That somewhere round here</i>

38
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:41,685
<i>Is the pet that will suit you just right.</i>

39
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:45,965
<i>I can't wait to get started,
but first let me set a few rules.</i>

40
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:48,365
<i>It's of utmost importance
the pet that I get</i>

41
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:50,605
<i>Is something that's awesome and cool.</i>

42
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:52,805
Awesome and cool. Got it!

43
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:57,215
<i>I have so many wonderful choices,
just wait, you will see.</i>

44
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:01,315
<i>I need something real fast like a bullet
to keep up with me.</i>

45
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:06,715
<i>Sure! How 'bout a bunny?
They're cutesy and wootsy and quick as can be.</i>

46
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:09,315
"Cutesy"? "Wootsy"?
Have you even met me?

47
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,545
<i>Rainbow, have faith!
You see, I will bet you.</i>

48
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,045
<i>Somewhere round here
is the pet that will get you.</i>

49
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:17,885
Come on, the sky is the limit.

50
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,275
Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.

51
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:23,625
Really? Because I think this wittle puddy
tat has your name written all over it.

52
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,525
Yes, he does! Aw, look, he likes you.

53
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:28,935
Pass.

54
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,925
<i>I have so many wonderful choices
for you to decide.</i>

55
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:36,165
<i>There are otters and seals
with massive appeal...</i>

56
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:37,985
Otters and seals do not fly.

57
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,115
Maybe not, but I've seen
this particular seal...

58
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,785
...catch ten feet of air
when he breaches the water.

59
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,165
That's it. I'm outta here.

60
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:50,575
<i>Wait! There must be a pet here,
that will fit that ticket.</i>

61
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:53,155
<i>How 'bout a ladybug or a cute cricket?</i>

62
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,955
Bigger! And cooler!

63
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:57,115
Bigger. Cooler. Right.

64
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,735
<i>I've got just the thing in that tree. Dash...</i>

65
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:04,105
<i>Meet your new fabulous pet squirrelee!</i>

66
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,605
It's just a squirrel.

67
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,165
Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!

68
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,725
Yeah... So, like I was saying...

69
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:17,165
<i>Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it.</i>

70
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:20,525
<i>I need a pet to keep up with me.</i>

71
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:24,365
<i>Something awesome, something flying...</i>

72
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,805
<i>...with coolness that defies gravity!</i>

73
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,205
I'm sensing you want
an animal that can fly.

74
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,055
You think?

75
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:35,635
<i>I have plenty of wonderful
creatures who soar in the sky.</i>

76
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:39,095
<i>Like a sweet hummingbird
or a giant monarch butterfly.</i>

77
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:40,675
Better. But cooler.

78
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:45,055
<i>I see. How 'bout an owl?
Or a wasp, or a toucan?</i>

79
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:48,475
<i>There's so many wonderful
creatures the likes of that.</i>

80
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:53,805
<i>There are falcons and eagles.
They are both quite regal.</i>

81
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,725
<i>Or perhaps what you need
is a dark and mysterious bat?</i>

82
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:58,365
Now you're talking!

83
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:02,235
But instead of just one standout
now that's too many.

84
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:06,395
<i>So many choices
and such riches a plenty.</i>

85
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:09,015
Not a bad problem to have,
if you ask me.

86
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:12,325
<i>The bat would be awesome,
but the wasp I'm digging too.</i>

87
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,435
<i>You have something
in a yellow striped bat?</i>

88
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:16,205
No.

89
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:19,795
<i>I've got a hot pink flamingo
Just dying to meet you.</i>

90
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:22,885
<i>What to do? What to do?</i>

91
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:26,995
<i>A prize! That's it!
There's really just one way...</i>

92
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:30,295
<i>...to find out which animal's best.</i>

93
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:34,725
<i>Hold a contest of speed,
agility and guts...</i>

94
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:40,085
<i>...that will put each pet to the test!</i>

95
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,185
<i>Don't forget style,
that should be considered.</i>

96
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,035
<i>Then we'll know for sure
who's best of the litter.</i>

97
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:47,115
<i>-The one who's as awesome as cool...
-...just like me!</i>

98
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:51,185
<i>Can't settle for less, cause I'm the best,
so a contest we will see!</i>

99
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:57,465
<i>Who's the number one greatest,
perfectest pet in the world for me!</i>

100
00:06:57,465 --> 00:07:03,065
<i>May the race begin!</i>

101
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,435
And may the best pet win!

102
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:14,215
Shh...!

103
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:19,575
So, you all think you've got what
it takes to be my pet, do ya?

104
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:22,165
Well, we'll just see about that.

105
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,585
If any of you don't think
you can handle it...

106
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:29,515
...bow out now before you humiliate
yourself in front of your peers.

107
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:33,045
This competition isn't for the weak.

108
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:36,145
You'd better be prepared
to step up your game!

109
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:38,795
YOU CALL THAT FLAPPING?!

110
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:40,345
That's better.

111
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:42,905
There's only room on team
just for one of you...

112
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:46,475
...and my future pet needs to
be able to take it to the extreme.

113
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:48,835
Any questions?

114
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:53,295
I got one. Does she understand
what a pet really needs?

115
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:56,745
Yeah. Like care and attention.
Love and affection.

116
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:59,575
Ugh! And breath mints!

117
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,415
Now you just pay attention
and try your best and...

118
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:06,815
Seriously, Fluttershy. The turtle?

119
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:08,965
What did you bring that thing here for?

120
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:11,045
Technically he's a tortoise.

121
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:13,725
And he's always dreamed
of being somepony's pet.

122
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:16,255
He just wants a chance to compete.
He won't get in the way.

123
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,385
You won't even know he's here.

124
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:23,825
No.

125
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,175
Oh. Just let him try.

126
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:29,125
But there's no way
he can possibly keep up.

127
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,485
Look at 'im.

128
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:35,315
-It won't hurt to let him try.
-But...

129
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,765
Just let him try!

130
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,485
Uh. Fine.

131
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:43,875
But don't say I didn't warn you!

132
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,105
This isn't a game, you know.

133
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:49,165
All right. Now these games
will determine which one of you...

134
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:52,295
...has the most important qualities
I'm looking for in a pet.

135
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:54,495
Speed!

136
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:55,935
Agility!

137
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,775
Guts!

138
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:02,045
Style!

139
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:03,915
Coolness!

140
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:05,635
Awesomeness!

141
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:08,095
And radicalness!

142
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,925
Aren't those all the same thing?

143
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,675
You would think that, Twilight.

144
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:15,905
And that's why you would
never qualify to be my pet.

145
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,835
Speed!

146
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:20,445
On your marks...

147
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,405
Get set...

148
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:32,125
Sorta speedy.

149
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:33,025
Not speedy.

150
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,475
Pretty speedy.

151
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,185
Could be more speedy.

152
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,825
Yeah! That's speed!

153
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,195
That's just sad.

154
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,345
Agility!

155
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,225
Sorta agile.

156
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:58,935
Not agile.

157
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,515
Pretty agile.

158
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:03,135
Could be more agile.

159
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:11,965
Wanna know the opposite
of agility? That.

160
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,045
Yeah, baby! Now that's
what I call agility!

161
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:25,435
Don't leave me hangin'!

162
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:31,315
I'm gonna have to shave a point
off your score for that.

163
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:41,025
Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and
get Opal's favorite toy away from her?

164
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:02,315
Now that takes guts!

165
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:12,525
Style.

166
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:18,655
Any pet of mine's gotta look good.

167
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,845
'Cause you gotta make me look good.

168
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:25,865
Coolness.

169
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:27,555
Sorta cool.

170
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,375
Not cool.

171
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:31,395
Pretty cool.

172
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:33,545
Could be cooler.

173
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,375
Not what I had in mind.

174
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:40,985
I can't hear you!

175
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,445
Now that's a cool sound!

176
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,025
Sorta awesome.

177
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,095
Not awesome.

178
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,045
Could be more awesome.

179
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:04,885
Hohoho yeah! That is awesome!

180
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:09,245
Uh... You did that already.

181
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,255
That's pretty much all you can do, huh?

182
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:33,595
Whoa...

183
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:36,315
That was truly awesome!

184
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,535
But I'm afraid this is
the radicalness competition, so...

185
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,325
...I'm gonna have to
take some points off.

186
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,695
Listen, turtle...

187
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,565
-Tortoise!
-Whatever!

188
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,325
You had your fun, but I think
you and I both know...

189
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:58,465
...who made the cut and who didn't.

190
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:05,625
You didn't.

191
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:12,505
I mean... A for effort and everything...

192
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,195
You gave it your best shot.

193
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:16,915
Maybe I've got a gold star sticker
around here somewhere you can have.

194
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:20,875
But seriously, go home.
You're starting to creep me out.

195
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:27,705
So... Anyway...

196
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,805
You're all outstanding competitors.

197
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:33,155
But there can be only one of you,
who's number one.

198
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:38,805
So the final, tie-breaking
contest is going to be...

199
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:40,885
(Pause for dramatic effect)

200
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:43,255
A race against...

201
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:44,255
...ME!

202
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,275
...through Ghastly Gorge!

203
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,775
DUN DUN DUUUN!

204
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:51,925
Gesundheit.

205
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,805
Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary.

206
00:13:57,805 --> 00:13:58,885
It's fun!

207
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,005
I've flown though it
a million times myself...

208
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,985
...so obviously I'll be
at the front of the pack.

209
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:08,595
But whichever of you make it
across the finish line with me...

210
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:10,575
...will have proven
he can keep up with me...

211
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:15,525
...and will have earned the honor
(and glory) of getting to be my pet.

212
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,405
Ready?

213
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:18,475
...setgo!

214
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:26,375
Try to keep up!

215
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,185
Can't catch me!

216
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:59,905
♪♪♪♪♪

217
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,485
Come on, slowpokes!

218
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,105
You wanna win, doncha?

219
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:28,105
;-P

220
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:39,105
Oh! I forgot to tell you!

221
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,475
Watch out for the quarray eels.

222
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,605
They don't like you when
you get too close to their nests.

223
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:45,965
Like this.

224
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,065
:-O

225
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,985
Easy-peasy, one too greasy.

226
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:08,235
Right, guys?

227
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,025
AVALANCHE!

228
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,435
Hey!

229
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:36,355
Come on...

230
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:39,515
No! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me!

231
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,785
I'm the one who's supposed to win!

232
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:43,065
I don't wanna end up stuck here...

233
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:44,955
...forever.

234
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:48,895
Oh no. Nonono. Thi...
This can't be happening.

235
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:52,325
Forever is way too long
to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge.

236
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,265
I mean... it's like...

237
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:55,435
...forever!

238
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:59,215
SOMEPONY! ANYPONY! HELP ME!!!

239
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,915
Woohoo!

240
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:16,705
My prayers have been answered!

241
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,255
Oh, thankyouthankyouthank...

242
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:19,925
YOU?!

243
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:22,135
Oh no!

244
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:24,635
Now I'm not only gonna
be stuck here forever...

245
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:29,005
...I'm gonna be stuck here forever with
the most annoying turtle in the world!

246
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,635
I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!

247
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:02,455
Something's not right here.

248
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,015
Where's Rainbow Dash?

249
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:07,065
Great gallopin' galoshes!

250
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,865
There's been an avalanche in there!

251
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:10,545
Rainbow!

252
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,785
Wait! Look!

253
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,245
It's the turtle!

254
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:17,225
-Tortoise!
-Whatever.

255
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,935
And he's carrying something on his back.

256
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:22,065
It's Rainbow Dash!
It's her! It's Rainbow!

257
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:30,605
Maybe we'd better go meet them halfway.

258
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,085
Way to go, little guy.

259
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,735
Oh, thank goodness
you're not hurt, Rainbow.

260
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,595
Just my pride.

261
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:52,285
I certainly hope all of this
dreadful dust was worth it...

262
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:56,255
It sure was if'n it means
Rainbow gets to have...

263
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,905
...her own little critter, just like
the rest of us, from now on.

264
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:02,485
Uh... thanks.

265
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:05,285
What you did... I owe you one.

266
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:09,805
Rainbow! Your new pet is
over here waiting for you!

267
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:19,415
Oh. Right. Yeah. That.

268
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,045
What's the matter?

269
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:23,005
You got your perfect pet, right?

270
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:26,085
The best of the best,
like you wanted, remember?

271
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:28,315
It can fly and it's not a squirrel.

272
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:29,665
Should we sing about it again?

273
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:32,125
A falcon sure looks
good on you, Rainbow.

274
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:39,895
Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of.

275
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,685
A falcon sure does look cool.

276
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:47,205
He's absolutely everything
I wanted in a pet.

277
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:50,105
Yay?

278
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:55,035
But I said whoever crosses the finish
line *with me* gets to be my pet.

279
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:56,995
You did! You did say that!

280
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,525
She did say that! That was the rule!

281
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:03,225
And the only racer, who crossed
the finish line with me...

282
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:06,685
...was the one, who stopped
to save me when I needed help.

283
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,245
The tortoise!

284
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,295
But what about the...?

285
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,135
Would you look at that.

286
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:23,245
He even smiles slow.

287
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:29,065
Spike, take a letter.

288
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,745
"Dear Princess Celestia."

289
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:35,115
"I used to think that the most important
traits to look for in a pet..."

290
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,575
"...or any best friend, were all
physical, competitive abilities."

291
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,605
"But now I can see how short-sighted
and shallow that was."

292
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:46,495
"Today I learned what the most
important quality really is."

293
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,455
"A certain kind of spirit.
A stick-to-it-iveness."

294
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:55,155
"A never-give-up, can-do attitude,
that's the mark of a real winner."

295
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:57,065
"And this tortoise has it."

296
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:58,235
Tenacity.

297
00:20:58,235 --> 00:20:59,205
Gesundheit.

298
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,145
"You just can't stop that little guy."

299
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:03,575
He's like a... like a...

300
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:04,515
...tank!

301
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:08,225
But Rainbow. You didn't want
a pet that couldn't fly...

302
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,435
...because it would keep you grounded
and hold you back, remember?

303
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:26,205
Come on, Tank! We're gonna be late
for our very first pony pet playdate!

304
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,625
