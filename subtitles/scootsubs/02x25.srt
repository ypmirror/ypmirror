1
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:14,425
It is gorgeous out.
Just gorgeous!

2
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:25,685
Twilight! I... have...

3
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:27,675
lemme just...

4
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:34,435
Dear Twilight,

5
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:38,735
I am sure you are as excited as I am
about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot.

6
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:40,325
Wedding?!

7
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:44,175
I will be presiding over the ceremony,
but would very much like you and your friends

8
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:46,705
to help with the preparations
for this wonderful occasion.

9
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:50,465
Fluttershy, I would like you and your
songbird choir to provide the music.

10
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,935
Oh my goodness! What an honor!

11
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:57,355
Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more
qualified than you to host the reception.

12
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:03,025
Applejack, you will be in charge
of the catering for the reception.

13
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:05,575
Well, color me pleased as punch!

14
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:09,375
Rainbow Dash, I would very much
appreciate it if you could perform

15
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,675
a sonic rainboom as the bride
and groom complete their I do's.

16
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:13,825
Yes!

17
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:17,075
Rarity, you will be responsible
for designing the dresses

18
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:18,975
for the bride and her bridesmaids.

19
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,555
Princess Celestia wants me to...

20
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:23,885
...wedding dress?

21
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:26,405
For a Canterlot wedding...

22
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:33,685
And as for you, Twilight, you will be
playing the most important role of all:

23
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:36,015
making sure that everything
goes as planned.

24
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,575
See you all very soon.
Yours, Princess Celestia.

25
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,765
But... I don't understand.
Who's getting married?

26
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:45,825
Oh, wait!

27
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:49,525
I was probably supposed
to give you this one first.

28
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:53,115
Princess Celestia cordially
invites you to the wedding of

29
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:55,805
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza,
and...

30
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:57,755
my brother?!

31
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:06,265


32
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:11,695


33
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:33,885


34
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,635
Your brother's getting married?

35
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:43,085
Congratulations, Twilight,
that's great news!

36
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:46,935
Yeah, great news... that I just got
from a wedding invitation!

37
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:50,135
Not from my brother,
but from a piece of paper!

38
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,095
Thanks a lot, Shining Armor.

39
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:54,615
I mean, really,
he couldn't tell me personally?

40
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,555
<i>Hey, Twilight,
just thought you should know...</i>

41
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:00,055
<i>I'm making a really big decision
that changes everything.</i>

42
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:03,325
<i>Oh, nevermind, you'll hear about it
when you get the invitation.</i>

43
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:07,595
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza?
Who in the hoof is that?!

44
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:11,465
Twilight? Are you okay?

45
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:15,435
Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor
and I have always been so close.

46
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,985
He's my B.B.B.F.F!

47
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,695
Big Brother Best Friend Forever?

48
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:26,045
Before I came here and learned
the importance of friendship,

49
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,755
Shining Armor was the only pony
I ever really accepted as a friend.

50
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:39,295
<i>When I was just a filly,
I found it rather silly</i>

51
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:43,885
<i>To see how many other ponies I could meet</i>

52
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:48,315
<i>I had my books to read,
didn't know that I would ever need</i>

53
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:52,505
<i>Other ponies to make my life complete</i>

54
00:03:52,655 --> 00:03:55,415
<i>But there was one colt that I cared for</i>

55
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:59,485
<i>I knew he would be there for me</i>

56
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:03,525
<i>My big brother,
best friend forever</i>

57
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:08,995
<i>Like two peas in a pod,
we did everything together</i>

58
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,945
<i>He taught me how to fly a kite</i>

59
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:14,075
<i>He taught me how to fly a kite
(Best friend forever)</i>

60
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,725
<i>We never had a single fight</i>

61
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,765
<i>We never had a single fight
(We did everything together)</i>

62
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,955
<i>We shared our hopes,
we shared our dreams</i>

63
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:26,755
<i>I miss him more than I realized</i>

64
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,865
<i>It seems...</i>

65
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:33,335
<i>Your big brother,
best friend forever</i>

66
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:38,495
<i>Like two peas in a pod,
you did everything together</i>

67
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:44,635
<i>And though he's so far away,
I hoped that he would stay</i>

68
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:49,275
<i>My Big Brother Best Friend</i>

69
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:53,755
<i>Forever</i>

70
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:59,105
<i>Forever...</i>

71
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,635
As one of your PFFs...

72
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:10,365
Pony Friends Forever...

73
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:15,145
I wanna tell you that I think your
brother sounds like a real good guy.

74
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,345
He is pretty special.

75
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:20,455
I mean, they don't let just anypony
be Captain of the Royal Guard.

76
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:23,265
So let me get this straight.

77
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:26,035
We're helping out with the
wedding of not only a princess,

78
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:28,875
but a Captain of the Royal Guard?

79
00:05:29,635 --> 00:05:31,145
I guess we are.

80
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:46,395
A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?!
Can you say "best wedding ever"!

81
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,535
Best wedding ever!

82
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,835
So you all get to help with
the big fancy wedding,

83
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:55,625
but I'm the one who gets
to host the bachelor party!

84
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:59,075
I have just one question,
what's a bachelor party?

85
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,225
Why the long face, sugarcube?

86
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,465
I'm just thinking about Shining Armor.

87
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,905
Ever since I moved to Ponyville,
we've been seeing each other less and less.

88
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:13,475
And now that he's starting
a new family with this...

89
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:18,155
"Princess Mi Amore Cal-whatshername",
we'll probably never see each other.

90
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:21,335
Come on, now. You're his sister.

91
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:23,265
He'll always make time for you.

92
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:26,215
Couldn't seem to make time
to tell me he was getting married.

93
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,355
What's with all the guards?

94
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:50,055
I'm sure they're just taking
the necessary precautions.

95
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:53,225
Royal weddings do bring out
the strangest ponies.

96
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,965
Now let's get going,
we've got work to do!

97
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,155
And you've got a big brother
to go congratulate.

98
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,845
Yeah. Congratulate.

99
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:07,205
And then give him a piece of my mind.

100
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,415
I've got something
to say to you, mister.

101
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,085
Twilie!

102
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:29,335
I've missed, you, kid.
How was the train ride, I-

103
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,525
How dare you not tell me in person
that you were getting married!

104
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,205
I'm your sister, for pony's sake!

105
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,705
It's not my fault!

106
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:40,495
Princess Celestia has requested
a major increase in security.

107
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:42,315
Didn't you see all the guards
at the train station?

108
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,505
Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up.

109
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,055
Maybe you heard about it?

110
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,035
It has nothing to do
with the wedding.

111
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:50,795
A threat has been made
against Canterlot.

112
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:54,875
We don't know who's responsible for it,
but Princess Celestia asked that

113
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,805
I help provide additional protection.

114
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:00,525
This, you need to see.

115
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:20,905
The burden of keeping Canterlot safe
and secure rests squarely on my shoulders.

116
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:24,825
Staying focused on the task at hand
has been my top priority.

117
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,025
Okay, okay, I get it.

118
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:32,705
You've got a really important job
protecting all of Canterlot

119
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:35,125
with a force field only you
can conjure up.

120
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:40,155
But still... how could you not tell me
about something as big as your wedding?

121
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:42,595
Am I not that important
to you any more?

122
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,305
Hey. You're my little sister.

123
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,035
Of course you're important to me.

124
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,865
But I'd understand if you didn't
want to be my best mare now.

125
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,505
You want me to be your best mare?

126
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,655
Well... yeah.

127
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,205
I'd be honored!

128
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:03,415
But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying
somepony I don't even know!

129
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:06,965
When did you even meet this
"Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"?

130
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:11,025
Twilie, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza
is Cadence.

131
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,475
Your old foalsitter.

132
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,215
Cadence? As in the Cadence?

133
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:18,505
As in the greatest foalsitter
in all the history of foalsitters?!

134
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,215
You tell me, she was your foalsitter.

135
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,485
Ohmygoshohmygosh!

136
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:26,425
<i>Cadence is only the
most amazing pony ever!</i>

137
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:30,925
<i>She's beautiful, she's caring,
she's kind...</i>

138
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,175
I am so lucky to have you
as my foalsitter!

139
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,605
I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight.

140
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:40,345
You're a princess.

141
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,635
I'm just a regular old unicorn.

142
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:46,535
You are anything but
a regular old unicorn.

143
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:52,805
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake,
clap your hooves and do a little shake!

144
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,035
I am going for a hooficure
and that is that!

145
00:09:58,185 --> 00:09:59,615
- You are not going.
- I am. I am...

146
00:10:08,935 --> 00:10:11,555
<i>How many unicorns can just
spread love wherever they go?</i>

147
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:13,515
<i>I only know of one!</i>

148
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,755
And you're marrying her!

149
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:20,085
You're marrying Cadence,
you're marrying Cadence!

150
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:23,305
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

151
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:24,465
Cadence!

152
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:29,755
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake,
clap your hooves and do a little shake!

153
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,105
What are you doing?

154
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,425
Cadence, it's me, Twilight!

155
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,995
I've gotta get back to my station.

156
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:45,275
But Cadence will be checking in with
all of you to see how things are going.

157
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:50,425
I think I speak for both of us when I say
we couldn't be more excited to have you here.

158
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:51,775
Right, dear?

159
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:54,105
Absolutely.

160
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:57,205
Well, we'll let you get to it.

161
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:06,615
Cake, check.

162
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,695
Ice sculpture, check.

163
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:17,145
Best darn bitesize apple fritter
you ever tasted...

164
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,035
Check.

165
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:22,635
<i>I do. Do you?</i>

166
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:23,785
<i>I do!</i>

167
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:29,625
Hiya, Princess!

168
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:33,625
Please, call me
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.

169
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,355
Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.

170
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:38,965
You come to check out what's
on the menu for your big day?

171
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,385
I have!

172
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:50,975
Delicious! I love, love, love them.

173
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:54,235
Aw, shucks. Why don't
you take a few to go?

174
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,355
I know how you brides can be.

175
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:01,505
So busy, you forget to get
a little somethin' in your belly.

176
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,735
Did... you see what she...

177
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,495
Oh, you should have seen
how she acted back there.

178
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,955
I don't know when she changed,
but she changed!

179
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,645
<i>"Please, call me
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."</i>

180
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:24,695
Did I hear someone say my name?

181
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:25,645
Your highness!

182
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:28,395
Let me just start by saying
what an honor it is to play a role

183
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:30,685
in such a momentous occasion.

184
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:34,975
Is my dress ready?

185
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:37,005
Yes, of course.

186
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,275
I've been working on it ever since
I was given the assignment.

187
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:43,855
And I think you'll be pleased
with the results!

188
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:48,685
I was hoping for something with
more beading and a longer train.

189
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:50,705
Yes, of course.

190
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,775
And those should be a different color.

191
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:55,405
I think they're lovely.

192
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,555
Me too.

193
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:57,805
I love them.

194
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:01,185
Make them a different color.

195
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:06,445
Gee, maybe her name should be
"Princess Demandy-pants."

196
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:13,765
Okay, let me see.

197
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:15,315
We've been over the games...

198
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:19,965
The dances...

199
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:25,825
I think this reception is gonna
be perfect! Don't you?

200
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,405
Perfect!

201
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:30,255
...if we were celebrating
a six-year-old's birthday party.

202
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:32,645
Thank you!

203
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:39,285
Rest, my sister.

204
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,565
As always, I will guard the night.

205
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:47,625
Bet I can guess what
you're all thinking!

206
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:51,385
Cadence is the absolute
worst bride-to-be ever.

207
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:53,905
<i>Who, me?</i>

208
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:56,155
Spike! That goes on the cake.

209
00:13:57,825 --> 00:14:00,455
Twilight, whatever are you talking about?

210
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,445
Cadence is an absolute gem!

211
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,225
Rarity, she was so demanding!

212
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,515
Well of course she was!

213
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:08,985
Why shouldn't she expect
the very best on her wedding day?

214
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,685
Applejack, did you know that after she told
you how much she just 'love-love-loved'

215
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:15,675
your hors-d'oeuvres,
she threw them in the trash?

216
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,805
Aw, she was probably just
trying to spare my feelings.

217
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,975
No, she was just being fake,
and totally insincere!

218
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:28,175
She did raise her voice at one of
my birds during rehearsal.

219
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,525
See? Rude!

220
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:33,325
But... he was singing really off-key.

221
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:39,395
Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed
how Cadence treated-

222
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:45,125
Nevermind.

223
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,045
Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?

224
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:51,145
Sorry Twi, been too busy prepping
for my sonic rainboom

225
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:54,115
to pay much attention to
the bride's bad attitude.

226
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,155
The princess is about to get married.

227
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:59,455
I'm sure any negative behavior
she might be displaying

228
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:01,305
is simply the result of nerves.

229
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:05,135
And I'm sure it's the result
of being an awful pony

230
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:08,365
who doesn't deserve to even know
Shining Armor let alone marry him!

231
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:13,255
Think maybe you're being just a tiny bit
possessive of your brother?

232
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,165
I am not being possessive!

233
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,735
And I am not taking it out on Cadence!

234
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,495
You're all just too caught up
in your wedding planning

235
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:23,025
to notice that maybe there
shouldn't even be a wedding!

236
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,275
Twilie!

237
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:40,255
Your big brother's looking
pretty good, don't you think?

238
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:43,125
Everything okay?

239
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,475
We need to talk.

240
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,825
I think you're making a big-

241
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:49,015
Oh, hi, sweetie.

242
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,555
She sure has a way
of sneaking up on people.

243
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:54,575
Could I speak to you for a moment,
dear?

244
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:57,195
Better see what she wants.

245
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:00,695
Look, we need to talk.

246
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:01,845
I'm here to talk.

247
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,885
- Look, she's okay-
- Just listen to me.

248
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,235
I'm listening, I'm listening...

249
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:09,695
I thought I made it perfectly clear
I didn't want you to wear that.

250
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,855
This was my favorite uncle's.

251
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:12,875
And...?

252
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:14,795
And I think I should wear it.

253
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:16,635
Are you disagreeing with me?

254
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,945
I guess I am!

255
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:23,345
Oh dear, are you getting
another one of your headaches?

256
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:30,275
Feeling better?

257
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:36,625
She isn't just unpleasant and rude,
she's downright evil!

258
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:40,935
Twilight!

259
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,175
Let her go.

260
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:47,745
It seemed like she had something else
she wanted to tell me.

261
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:51,905
Who goes there?

262
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:54,505
Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle.

263
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:57,885
Shining Armor's in real trouble!
You have to help-

264
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:00,705
Dresses?

265
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,065
What are you...?

266
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:04,085
Can you believe it?

267
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:08,285
We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore
Cadenza's new bridesmaids!

268
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:09,845
"New" bridesmaids?

269
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,205
What happened to her "old" bridesmaids?!

270
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:13,355
She didn't say.

271
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:17,275
But she did tell us that she would
love love love it if we'd fill in for them.

272
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:19,375
Seeing as we've been working
so hard and everything.

273
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,755
And you had your doubts about her.

274
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,345
Told you she was an absolute gem!

275
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:24,985
You sure this is what I should wear?

276
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:28,995
Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.

277
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:30,885
I'll see what I can do.

278
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,455
This is so exciting!

279
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:34,145
I know! This is awesome!

280
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,225
Looks like I really am on my own.

281
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:46,905
Perfect, girls. No need to rush!

282
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,645
Then of course, Cadence will enter.

283
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,545
I'll say a few words,
and then we'll begin with the vows.

284
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:06,625
Shining Armor, you'll get
the ring from your Best Mare.

285
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:09,715
Do you?

286
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:11,065
I do!

287
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:14,055
Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?

288
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,965
I'm here!

289
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:19,415
I'm not gonna stand next to her.

290
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,925
And neither should you!

291
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:26,185
I'm sorry, I don't know
why she's acting like this.

292
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,085
Maybe we should just ignore her.

293
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,125
You have to listen to me!

294
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:33,195
Oh goodness! Are you okay?

295
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,345
I'm fine.

296
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:35,495
Ya sure about that?

297
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,975
I've got something to say!

298
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,115
She's evil!

299
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:47,925
She's been horrible to my friends...

300
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:51,095
She's obviously done something
to her bridesmaids...

301
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:52,905
And if that wasn't enough,

302
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,215
I saw her put a spell on my brother
that made his eyes go all...!

303
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:06,565
Why are you doing this to me?!

304
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:08,285
Because you're evil!

305
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:13,385
Evil! And if I don't stop you,
you're gonna ruin my brother's life!

306
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:23,975
You want to know why my eyes went all...?

307
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:28,545
Because ever since I started having
to perform my protection spell,

308
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:30,695
I've been getting terrible migraines.

309
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:35,905
Cadence hasn't been casting spells on me,
she's been using her magic to heal me!

310
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,865
And she decided to
replace her bridesmaids

311
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:42,115
because she found out the only reason
they wanted to be in the wedding

312
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,205
was so that they could
meet Canterlot royalty!

313
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:46,745
And if she hasn't been on her
best behavior with your friends,

314
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,095
it's because with me being so busy,
she's had to make all the decisions

315
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:51,245
about the wedding!

316
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:52,495
I was just trying to-

317
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:55,035
She's completely stressed out
because it's really important to her

318
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,785
that her big day be perfect!

319
00:19:57,185 --> 00:20:00,555
Something that obviously
wasn't important to you.

320
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:07,745
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go and comfort my bride.

321
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,945
And you can forget about
being my best mare.

322
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:15,555
In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't
show up to the wedding at all.

323
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:24,285
C'mon, y'all.
Let's go check on the princess.

324
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,115
- I was...
- You have a lot to think about.

325
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:38,035
Maybe I was being overprotective.

326
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:41,455
I could've gained a sister.

327
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:45,055
But instead... I just lost a brother.

328
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:50,865
<i>He was my Big Brother,
Best Friend</i>

329
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:54,955
<i>Forever...</i>

330
00:20:55,565 --> 00:21:00,255
<i>And now, we'll never do anything</i>

331
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:04,625
<i>Together...</i>

332
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:13,875
I'm sorry!

333
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:17,385
You will be.
