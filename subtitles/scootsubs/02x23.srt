1
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:12,365
Can you believe Featherweight
got his cutie mark?

2
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:14,645
Featherweight! Before us!

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,085
Great cutie mark, Featherweight!

4
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:23,405
Looking good!

5
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:25,975
I give up...

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,225
I've got it!

7
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:31,045
The answer to all our problems!

8
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:33,055
The Foal Free Press?

9
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:35,855
How's the school paper
gonna get us our cutie marks?

10
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:37,885
Move your caboose!

11
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:40,425
That's Granny Smith. Gotta run!

12
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:43,685
Maybe there's something
to this newspaper idea.

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,495
Guess it's worth a shot...

14
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:13,625
Apple Bloom, your newspaper idea
was nothing but a big bust.

15
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:18,745
We tried everything, from papier-mâché
to making birds nests and nothing worked.

16
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:23,265
What's so funny?

17
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:26,585
What I meant was,
we should write for the paper!

18
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:29,715
We can get our cutie marks as journalists!

19
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:39,355


20
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,915


21
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:07,385


22
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:11,795
Okay class, see you tomorrow!

23
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:14,485
Oh, and for those of you who want
to join the newspaper staff,

24
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,165
stay here because we're meeting right now!

25
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:19,135
Cutie marks in journalism!

26
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,895
Such a good idea.

27
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:22,245
Welcome, everypony.

28
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:26,075
Now, as you know,
our editor-in-chief graduated last year.

29
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,175
Yes?

30
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:30,665
What's an editor-in-chief?

31
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:34,965
Good question, Sweetie Belle,
I like those reporters' instincts.

32
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:38,995
The Foal Free Press
is a student-run paper.

33
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:41,015
I'm only involved as an advisor.

34
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:44,215
So the editor-in-chief
is the pony in charge.

35
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:47,825
From choosing the stories,
to making sure it gets to press on time.

36
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:52,775
Now, as I said,
we have a new editor this year!

37
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,765
Diamond Tiara?!

38
00:02:58,215 --> 00:03:01,315
I'll leave you alone now to discuss
everypony's assignments.

39
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:02,565
Have fun!

40
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:05,915
Alright, listen up.

41
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:08,865
The Foal Free Press is a joke.

42
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:12,395
Nopony at this school takes it seriously.

43
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:17,515
Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge,
am gonna deliver us to newfound glory!

44
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:20,235
Yay!

45
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:22,675
First things first,
where's the staff photographer?

46
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:26,025
Get out there and document everything.

47
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,065
I'll decide what's important.

48
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:31,885
The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news
and interesting thinkpieces.

49
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:34,945
No more namby-pamby stories
like last year's editor.

50
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,525
But Namby-Pamby was a great editor.

51
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,425
Well, there's a new regime now,
and I want juicy stories.

52
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:41,775
The juicier the better!

53
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:43,725
Now get out there and report!

54
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:47,985
Let's get out of here, girls.

55
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,235
Maybe we can try packing boxes again.

56
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:53,665
But this could be our last chance
to earn our cutie marks!

57
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:56,275
If we really are supposed
to be journalists,

58
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:58,265
isn't it worth a little grief?

59
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:59,615
I guess you're right.

60
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:03,125
We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara
for a lifetime of cutie marks.

61
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,925
C'mon! Let's go get those marks!

62
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:09,715
<i>My first story's gonna be
an exclusive interview.</i>

63
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:27,375
<i>I saw a brand new nest
of baby birds the other day.</i>

64
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:30,675
<i>I bet our readers would eat up
a sweet story like that!</i>

65
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,215
<i>Granny Smith has all sorts
of great stories!</i>

66
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,265
<i>I reckon I'll do a piece
on the history of Ponyville.</i>

67
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:03,435
I hope you've got something,
because everything so far is unusable.

68
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:07,875
"Baby Birds Born...?"
"Rarity's Hot New Hat...?"

69
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:10,755
"Ponyville, The Early Years...!?"

70
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:16,125
I don't know what you call this,
but it sure isn't news!

71
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,735
We just... thought...

72
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:20,565
Get something else on my desk
by the end of the day,

73
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:22,985
and it better be juicy!

74
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:32,045
Now what? Do you know what
I had to do to get that story?

75
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:35,875
Oh, you don't even wanna know
what I had to sit through.

76
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,405
Get it off me, Snails!

77
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:42,815
Yeah, you get it off me, Snips?

78
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:46,085
Stop it! You are making it worse!

79
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,915
Oh, great.

80
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,215
I'll get it.

81
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:56,465
Get it off! Get it off!

82
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,645
Hey, Featherweight, c'mere!

83
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:04,125
Take a few pictures of this,
then meet me during lunch.

84
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,425
Girls, I have our story.

85
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:12,215
<i>Snips and Snails in bubblegum fails!</i>

86
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:16,595
"And that's when the biggest jokester
in school really stuck his hoof in it..."

87
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:17,915
"... literally!"

88
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:21,605
The Foal Free Press is usually
just boring news and stuff.

89
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:23,365
So funny!

90
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:26,595
Our mothers always told us
we'd end up in the papers someday.

91
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:27,925
Yeah, and look!

92
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:30,615
We finally got the gum out!

93
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,315
Your column is a sensation!

94
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:35,915
I don't want you doing news anymore.

95
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:38,345
I want more columns like this.

96
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,025
Columns about ponies
and their private lives...

97
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,315
The things they do when
they think they're alone...

98
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:47,935
You three are my new gossip columnists!

99
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:51,515
And I love the way you signed it!

100
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:55,415
Gabby Gums...
that was a stroke of genius!

101
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,015
We couldn't fit all of our names.

102
00:06:57,165 --> 00:07:00,185
So we decided to create one
for all three of us.

103
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,265
Well, I want more Gabby Gums!

104
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:04,515
Nice work, girls.

105
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,595
But we sure seem
to have a gift for gossip.

106
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:10,985
If we can write a few more
of these Gabby Gums columns,

107
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:13,425
we'll earn our cutie marks for sure!

108
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:20,915
Scootaloo...? Do you have anything?

109
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,065
Nope.

110
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,405
Apple Bloom?

111
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,115
Sorry.

112
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:31,465
Let's face it, nothing very juicy
happens at this school.

113
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:35,665
We're doomed.

114
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,695
Sweetie Belle... was she raised
in a barn or something?

115
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,155
You really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity.

116
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:03,075
Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity.

117
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:05,855
Hello... what's this?

118
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,225
Gum on their bum!

119
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:11,185
Too rich!

120
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:14,375
Can you please keep it down
with all the laughter?

121
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:16,525
I'm trying to- hey!

122
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:18,875
I was just...

123
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:21,125
Are you snooping through my saddlebag?

124
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,655
How dare you!

125
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:32,025
Oh, but this Gabby Gums
column is so funny!

126
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:35,135
You actually like the school paper?

127
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:40,135
It's so much juicier than anything
in the boring old Ponyville Express.

128
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:43,045
Could I borrow this to show my friends?

129
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:46,575
Your friends would wanna read
the Foal Free Press?

130
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,265
Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums!

131
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:50,615
Who is she, anyway?

132
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:53,145
I've never heard of her before.
Is she a new-

133
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:59,025
We gave up too quickly, girls.

134
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:01,335
Forget trying to squeeze stories
out of this school.

135
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:03,485
We need to expand!

136
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:06,975
We can find all kinds of great gossip
out there in Ponyville!

137
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,985
We'll need to tell Featherweight
to start working overtime.

138
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:12,785
Sweetie Belle, you're a genius!

139
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:21,925
<i>"Pound and Pumpkin Cake trip
to the store ends in tears."</i>

140
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,675
Gabby Gums comes through again!

141
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:28,625
The Ponyville news stand
wants to carry the Foal Free Press!

142
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,785
Ponies keep coming by and asking for it!

143
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,065
Send 'em twenty copies,
and if they run out of those,

144
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:35,175
we'll send 'em twenty more!

145
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,455
You three are doing
a great job for this paper.

146
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:41,045
Keep those columns coming!

147
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:42,825
This is great!

148
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,825
Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls?

149
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,405
The best hooficure I've ever had!

150
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,925
You said it.

151
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:21,645
I don't know if I've ever been
so relaxed.

152
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:22,795
You guys!

153
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:25,785
The new Gabby Gums just came out!

154
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:29,325
<i>"The Great and Powerful Trixie's
secrets revealed!"</i>

155
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:32,055
We already read that one, Rainbow Dash.

156
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:36,295
Come on, relax, have a hooficure,
it feels amazing.

157
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,375
Did you forget who you're talking to?

158
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,885
The day I get a hooficure
is the day I turn in my daredevil license.

159
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:44,625
Besides, I haven't read
this Gabby Gums yet.

160
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,665
Well, do it quietly, will ya?

161
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,175
Some of us are trying to unwind!

162
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:55,375
I like Gabby Gums too, but don't
you think she can be a little mean?

163
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:58,525
She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!

164
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:00,625
<i>"Celestia, just like us?"</i>

165
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,905
Gabby Gums doesn't value
anypony's privacy.

166
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:08,055
Oh, lighten up, Twilight,
there's nothing but harmless gossip!

167
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:10,625
Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one.

168
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,425
<i>"Mayor, not naturally gray!"</i>

169
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,945
"The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal?"

170
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,895
Who wouldn't wanna read that?

171
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:21,325
I just can't help feeling sorry for
the ponies featured in her columns.

172
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:23,735
It's gotta be a little embarrassing.

173
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:24,885
Are you kidding?

174
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:27,465
Do you know how awesome it is
to get your name in the paper?

175
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,115
Rainbow, why don't you join me
in one of these delicious hooficures?

176
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:38,345
It's that good, huh?
Well, maybe just one little hoof.

177
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,115
Forget it, I don't like ponies
touching my hooves.

178
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:58,625
Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums
did a story on me.

179
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,075
She did one on me.

180
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:01,225
What?!

181
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:05,345
<i>"Exclusive! Local dragon tells all."</i>

182
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:10,325
"Spike opens up about Canterlot,
naps, and his favorite jams!"

183
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,185
It's our best column yet!

184
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:15,275
More like your worst column yet!

185
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:17,675
Gabby Gums didn't become
the biggest thing in Ponyville

186
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:20,105
with namby-pamby stories like this!

187
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,945
Yeah, she's right.

188
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:28,865
This column is a little softer
than our usual gossip.

189
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:32,305
Were you guys feeling guilty
about all the gossip too?

190
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:35,735
Like... maybe we could be
hurting other ponies' feelings?

191
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:41,105
Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because
everypony loves Gabby Gums so much,

192
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:45,435
but... I was sorta hoping we could start
writing more stories like this one.

193
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:46,885
Me too.

194
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:52,325
If we're gonna get our cutie marks,
we've got to give the ponies

195
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:53,475
what they want.

196
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,175
<i>"Applejack, asleep on the job!"</i>

197
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,035
Can y'all believe this?!

198
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:01,905
And this one:

199
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:04,745
<i>"Big Macintosh, what's he hiding?"</i>

200
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,505
Who the hay does this Gabby Gums
think she is?

201
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:08,755
Listen to this one.

202
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:12,275
<i>"Twilight Sparkle, I was a Canterlot snob."</i>

203
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,675
"A well-placed scaly source
close to the prissy pony says..."

204
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:19,145
"Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville
is nothing but muddy roads..."

205
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:20,825
"... and low-class rooves."

206
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:22,175
Spike!

207
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:25,285
How could you say such a thing?

208
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:28,665
Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up!

209
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:30,015
I never said anything like that!

210
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,255
Everypony, please!

211
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:36,095
She's just a harmless schoolpony
engaged in a little idle gossip.

212
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:38,905
You're really making too big a deal
out of this.

213
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:40,815
But it's all lies!

214
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,915
Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants.

215
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,455
She doesn't care whose reputation
she destroys!

216
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,895
<i>"Fluttershy has tail extensions!"</i>

217
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,795
<i>"Pinkie Pie is an out-of-control
party animal!"</i>

218
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:54,945
What?!

219
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:59,875
It's true! I do have a problem!

220
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:04,175
Oh look! According to this one,
the Cakes are breaking up!

221
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,925
We are?!

222
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:09,995
Well, my life is officially... over.

223
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:12,625
Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale.

224
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,415
<i>"Rainbow Dash,
Speed demon or super softie?"</i>

225
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,785
I grabbed as many copies as I could,
but it was too late!

226
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:22,495
I'm a laughing stock!

227
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:23,945
See, Rarity?

228
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,425
Your so-called 'harmless gossip'
can be very hurtful!

229
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:30,785
Honestly, you ponies
have no sense of humor.

230
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:34,045
So she tweaks a few ponies
every now and then,

231
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:35,205
maybe they deserv-

232
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,625
I'll destroy her!

233
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,165
<i>"The drama queen diaries."</i>

234
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:41,915
She's reprinted my diary!

235
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,585
How could Gabby Gums possibly
get access to my private diary?!

236
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:48,355
We've got to put a stop to this
once and for all!

237
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:50,665
Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff.

238
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:53,095
Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is!

239
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:59,085
My sister would never associate
with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums!

240
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,785
I resent you even suggesting
such a thing, Twilight!

241
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:06,285
Why, she's the most innocent,
most lovely...

242
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:09,635
... most evil pony in Equestria!

243
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:13,095
My own sister steals my private diary.

244
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:18,025
How could my own sister be...
Gabby Gums?

245
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,285
<i>Et tu, Gabby Gums?! </i>

246
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:31,155
You know?! How'd you find out?!

247
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,995
The gilded pages of your betrayal!

248
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,345
Oh yeah.

249
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:37,485
How could you do this to me?!

250
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:42,305
You stole my secret diary and published it
for all the world to read!

251
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,515
Gossip can be a very hurtful thing.

252
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:48,425
It is an invasion of privacy, just like
when I snooped through your saddlebag.

253
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:50,475
You didn't like that much, did you?

254
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:51,625
No...

255
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:55,295
What is important is that you understand
how your column makes the ponies

256
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,065
that you're writing about feel!

257
00:15:57,215 --> 00:16:00,255
I do understand,
and we've all been feeling guilty.

258
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:03,005
But we just want our cutie marks so badly!

259
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:05,885
Do you really think that
writing nasty things

260
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:09,255
and making everypony feel horrible
is your destiny?

261
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:11,925
Well, when you put it that way...

262
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:13,075
No!

263
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:15,195
I won't let you quit!

264
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:19,075
But the gossip we've been printing
is hurting everypony's feelings!

265
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:22,405
Feelings? I don't care about feelings!

266
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,815
Gabby Gums is my bread and butter.

267
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,925
And I'm not gonna let you
goody two horseshoes

268
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:28,375
take that away from me!

269
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:31,885
We're sorry, Diamond Tiara,
but we've made our decision.

270
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:35,105
Yeah, you can't force us
to keep gossiping.

271
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:37,795
When you see these...

272
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:40,835
You may not want to quit after all.

273
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,925
I told Featherweight
to document everything...

274
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,615
And that's exactly what he did.

275
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:58,205
Gimme those!

276
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:01,255
Sorry, girls, property of
the Foal Free Press.

277
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:04,915
And if Gabby Gums really
does go into retirement,

278
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,335
I'll need something to fill
that empty column space.

279
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:13,125
Now get out there
and bring me more Gabby Gums!

280
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,505
We'll find a way out of this, girls.

281
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:19,855
Maybe Rainbow Dash
will have a story for us.

282
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,505
She's always good for some gossip.

283
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:25,265
Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!

284
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:28,685
Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums.

285
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:30,235
You heard too, huh?

286
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:31,375
Are you kidding?

287
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:33,995
Everypony in town knows it's you three.

288
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:37,165
Don't suppose you'd let us
write a column on you, huh?

289
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:50,855
Oh, hi Angel, is Fluttershy home?

290
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,445
Hey, what gives?

291
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,845
Twilight thought you might try
to show your faces around here,

292
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:08,835
so she put up a force field.

293
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,145
Aw, c'mon, Applejack!

294
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:15,345
You're not mad at us too, are you?

295
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:16,495
Yup.

296
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,725
You're not even gonna talk to us?

297
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,875
Nope.

298
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:23,975
You should be ashamed of yourself,
humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that.

299
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,965
We don't wanna talk to
any y'all right now,

300
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:29,155
so take your little gossip column
and your embarrassing photographs

301
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:31,725
and just go away!

302
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:47,375
We've ruined all of our friendships
and we still don't have our cutie marks!

303
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,505
This is the worst day ever!

304
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:51,845
Oh yeah? Wait 'til tomorrow.

305
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:54,495
Our most embarrassing moments
are about to be published

306
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:56,825
for everypony to laugh at.

307
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,625
So, what do we do?

308
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,135
I don't know.

309
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:03,595
We're not leaving this clubhouse
until we think of something!

310
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:12,325
That's it, Gabby Gums is out of time.

311
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:13,675
Run these instead.

312
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:17,435
I want this paper on every
street corner in Ponyville!

313
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:18,885
Yes, ma'am!

314
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:21,945
Stop the presses!

315
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,265
Uh, they haven't started yet.

316
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:27,465
We have a Gabby Gums column!

317
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:31,205
You're lucky I'm nice.

318
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:35,135
This better not happen again, or else.

319
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:45,025
Well done, Diamond Tiara.

320
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:49,855
You've averted yet another crisis
with your amazing diplomatic skills.

321
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:54,595
<i>"An open letter to Ponyville
by Gabby Gums"?! </i>

322
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:55,955
What is this?!

323
00:19:57,475 --> 00:19:59,595
They're not gonna get away with this!

324
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:02,135
I'll publish those photos tomorrow!

325
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,095
They messed with the wrong pony!

326
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:09,145
<i>To the citizens of Ponyville.</i>

327
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:12,855
<i>For some time now, you've been reading
this column to get the latest dirt </i>

328
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:14,215
<i>and the hottest buzz.</i>

329
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,625
<i>But this will be my final piece.</i>

330
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:20,395
<i>We want to apologize for the pain
and embarrassment we've caused.</i>

331
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:23,235
<i>Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies.</i>

332
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:25,935
<i>Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo.</i>

333
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,645
<i>As the popularity of our column grew,
we got swept up in the hype.</i>

334
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:34,415
<i>We knew that what we were
doing didn't feel quite right,</i>

335
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:36,925
<i>but we ignored the guilt,
because everypony </i>

336
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:39,285
<i>seemed to want to read
what we were writing.</i>

337
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:44,475
<i>From now on, we promise to respect
everypony else's privacy.</i>

338
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,625
<i>and we won't engage
in hurtful gossip any more.</i>

339
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:50,925
<i>All we can do is ask for
your forgiveness, Ponyville.</i>

340
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:56,515
<i>Signing off for the very last time,
XOXO, Gabby Gums.</i>

341
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:01,235
Well, staff, I guess I gave
a little too much authority

342
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,885
to a first-time editor.

343
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:07,225
I'm sorry, Diamond Tiara,
I have to strip you of your title.

344
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:12,995
And for the next editor
of the Foal Free Press...

345
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:17,945
Here's your new editor-in-chief,
Featherweight!

346
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:24,035
Oh, him? But what about me?!

347
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:28,775
Here ya go! I've been promoted
to staff photographer!
