1
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,975
Let's do this.

2
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:36,285
Happy! Sad.
Happy! Sad.

3
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,835
Open, shut.
Open, shut.

4
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:10,085
Nailed it!

5
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:19,025

6
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:24,125

7
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:47,025

8
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,395
Morning, Daisy Jo!

9
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:59,385
You here to pick up some cookies
to go with your milk?

10
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,475
Oh ya, Pinkie, don'tcha know?

11
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:04,835
Well, Mrs. Cake just baked a fresh batch
of your favorite oatmeal.

12
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:07,725
Sounds delightful!

13
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,525
Rose, your calla lilies look even better
than last year!

14
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:15,035
I bet you'll take first prize
at the flower show again.

15
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,105
Thanks, Pinkie.
Would you like one?

16
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,525
Absolutely!

17
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:26,755
Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr. Waddle.

18
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,925
And you're wearing my favorite tie!

19
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:32,535
Aw shucks Miss Pinkie,
you flatterer you.

20
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:36,155
Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee.

21
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,965
Thank you, Pinkie.

22
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:40,505
Happy day-after-your-birthday, Zecora!

23
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:43,115
What a lovely hi, Miss Pinkie Pie!

24
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,825
And Miss Matilda, happy birthday to you...

25
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:49,225
...in one hundred and thirty two days!

26
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:54,445
Pinkie Pie, how do you remember
everything about everypony?

27
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:59,855
'Cause everypony's my friend
and I love to see my friends smile!

28
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:08,585
<i>My name is Pinkie Pie

<i>And I will brighten up your day!</i>

32
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,975
<i>It doesn't matter now
(What's up?)</i>

33
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,945
<i>If you are sad or blue
(Howdy!)</i>

34
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,475
<i>'Cuz cheering up my friends</i>

35
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:30,185
<i>Is just what Pinkie's here to do!</i>

36
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:36,155
<i>'Cuz I love to make you smile, smile, smile!
(Yes I do!)</i>

37
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:42,565
<i>It fills my heart with sunshine all the while!
(Yes it does!)</i>

38
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:47,115
<i>'Cuz all I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

39
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,925
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

40
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:54,865
<i>I like to see you grin!
(Awesome!)</i>

41
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,745
<i>I love to see you beam!
(Rock on!)</i>

42
00:03:57,745 --> 00:04:01,015
<i>The corners of your mouth turned up</i>

43
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:04,085
<i>Is always Pinkie's dream!
(Hoof bump!)</i>

44
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,815
<i>But if you're kind of worried</i>

45
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:10,035
<i>And your face is made of frown</i>

46
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:13,295
<i>I'll work your heart and do my best</i>

47
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:17,655
<i>To turn that sad frown upside down!</i>

48
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:23,665
<i>'Cuz I love to make you grin, grin, grin!
(Yes I do!)</i>

49
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:29,135
<i>Busted out from ear to ear, let it begin!</i>

50
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:34,875
<i>Just give me a joyful
grin, grin, grin!</i>

51
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,125
<i>And you fill me with good cheer!</i>

52
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:41,595
<i>It's true, some days are dark and lonely</i>

53
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:44,105
<i>And maybe you feel sad</i>

54
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:48,615
<i>But Pinkie will be there to show you
that it isn't that bad!</i>

55
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:51,125
<i>There is one thing that makes me happy</i>

56
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:54,775
<i>And makes my whole life worthwhile</i>

57
00:04:54,775 --> 00:05:00,645
<i>And that's when I talk to my friends
and get them to smile!</i>

58
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:03,985
<i>I really am so happy!</i>

59
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,715
<i>Your smile fills me with glee!</i>

60
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:10,175
<i>I give a smile, I get a smile</i>

61
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,715
<i>And that's so special to me!</i>

62
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:18,955
<i>'Cuz I love to see you beam, beam, beam!
(Yes I do!)</i>

63
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:25,385
<i>Tell me what more can I say to make you see
(That I do!)</i>

64
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:30,195
<i>It makes me happy when you
beam, beam, beam!</i>

65
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,515
<i>Yes, it always makes my day!</i>

66
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:36,415
<i>Come on everypony, smile, smile smile!</i>

67
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:39,725
<i>Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!</i>

68
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:42,625
<i>All I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

69
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,725
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

70
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,685
<i>Come on everypony, smile, smile, smile!</i>

71
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:51,805
<i>Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!</i>

72
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:54,685
<i>All I really need's a
smile, smile, smile!</i>

73
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:57,765
<i>From these happy friends of mine!</i>

74
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:00,835
<i>That's the perfect gift for me!
(Come on everypony, smile, smile, smile!)</i>

75
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:03,995
<i>It's a smile as wide as a mile!
(Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine!)</i>

76
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,775
<i>To make me happy as can be!
(All I really need's a smile, smile, smile!)</i>

77
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,315
<i>To make me happy as can be!
(From these happy friends of...)</i>

78
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:16,135
<i>Smile! Smile! Smile! Smile! Smiiiiiile!</i>

79
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:19,125
<i>Come on and smile!
(Smile!)</i>

80
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,175
<i>Come on and smile!</i>

81
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:26,465
I've never seen you before.

82
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:28,735
Kid, you're smarter than you look.

83
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:31,485
Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie.
What's your name?

84
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:37,885
"Property of C.D.D."

85
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:40,065
I'm guessing that last "D"
is for Donkey.

86
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:41,575
Quick as a whip, kid.

87
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,535
Now, how about that C...

88
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:50,425
Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine?
Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico?

89
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:55,505
Claudio? Cleetus? Clifford? Coraline?
Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopher?

90
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:57,735
Cranky! It's Cranky, alright?!

91
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:59,315
And your middle name?

92
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:00,965
Doodle.

93
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:02,565
- I'm sorry?
- Doodle.

94
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:04,005
One more time!

95
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,215
Doodle.

96
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:11,585
So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?

97
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,885
<i>You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey guy</i>

98
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:15,825
<i>A Cranky Doodle Donkey</i>

99
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,625
<i>I've never met you,
but you're my new friend</i>

100
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,785
<i>And I'm your best friend Pinkie Pie!</i>

101
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:23,555
C'mon now, Doodle. Give a smile!

102
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:28,515
Nopony calls me Doodle!

103
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,695
What just happened?

104
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:39,005
<i>Meet somepony new, check.</i>

105
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,695
<i>Introduce myself, check.</i>

106
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:43,165
<i>Sing random song outta nowhere, check.</i>

107
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:46,335
<i>Become instant best friends... uncheck.</i>

108
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:51,005
I don't get it, how can somepony
not become instant best friends with me?

109
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:54,865
Was it something I said?
Was it something I sang?

110
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:59,015
This is no time for the blame game,
Pinkie!

111
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,805
There's somepony new in town,
and you need to win him over!

112
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,905
"Try everything you can to make
Cranky smile and be your friend".

113
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:08,785
Check!

114
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,235
Alright, Pinkie.

115
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:21,725
If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship,
you're gonna have to bring your A game!

116
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,555
Let's do this.

117
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:29,085
Howdy doody, Cranky Doodle!

118
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:37,195
So... are you moving to Ponyville,
Cranky?

119
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:39,155
What gave you the hint there, kid?

120
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:40,775
The cart full of stuff, maybe?

121
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:42,545
Well, I'd be happy to show you around.

122
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,745
It's the least a new friend can do.

123
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:50,275
Listen, kid, I traveled around Equestria
my entire life.

124
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:53,765
I've made many friends.
I don't need any more.

125
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:56,875
Gosh! I could never have
too many friends!

126
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,655
Well, why don't you go
and make some more?

127
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:04,255
But I don't need to go,
when I can stay and make friends...

128
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,555
...with you.

129
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,135
Look, kid...

130
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:14,155
Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie.
All of my friends do.

131
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,615
Look, kid,

132
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:20,875
I came to Ponyville for some peace
and quiet and privacy,

133
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,785
to be alone with my memories.

134
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,665
All I want is to get to my new home
and unpack my stuff.

135
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:29,765
What does this bauble do?

136
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:31,675
Don't touch that!

137
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:33,955
What's this?

138
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:37,375
Please, don't!

139
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,915
Look at these!

140
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,455
Pinkie! Keep your hooves off my wagon!

141
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:48,585
Okay, Cranky.

142
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,345
I promised not to touch your wagon
so I brought one of my own!

143
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:59,595
I use it to welcome folks!

144
00:09:59,595 --> 00:09:59,735
Who'da guessed...
I use it to welcome folks!

145
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,035
Who'da guessed...

146
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,635
Maybe we can be wagon buddies?

147
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:08,235
Well, you've gotta at least let me
give you the special welcome

148
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:09,875
that comes with it...

149
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:16,615
Let's get this over with.

150
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,015
That's the spirit!

151
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:25,015
<i>Welcome welcome welcome</i>

152
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,845
<i>A fine welcome to you</i>

153
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:30,555
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
I say how do you do?</i>

154
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:34,065
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
I say hip hip hurray</i>

155
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:39,855
<i>Welcome welcome welcome
to Ponyville today!</i>

156
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,455
Wait for it!

157
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:51,355
Oh, silly me!

158
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:54,915
I must've put the confetti in the oven
and the cake in the confetti cannons!

159
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:56,015
Again!

160
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:02,045
Still delicious!
Try some, Cranky.

161
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,835
It's sure to make you smile.

162
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:06,865
Where is it, where is it?

163
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:07,955
Where is what?

164
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,495
Spider! Big hairy spider!

165
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,565
Stop, stop, stop!

166
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:21,995
Was that your wig?

167
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:24,175
I can fix this, I can fix this!

168
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:28,675
Hey, everypony!
Does anypony have a toupee?

169
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:36,195
This donkey is really, really, bald!

170
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,875
What's so funny?
This is serious business, everypony!

171
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,475
Cranky needs a new wig
to cover his hairless head!

172
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,525
I have had enough!

173
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,285
You're losing him, Pinkie.

174
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:59,815
Wait, Cranky, please!
Let me make it up to you...

175
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:00,615
No!

176
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:03,395
Please! Please please please...

177
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:06,105
Ladies, this is a spa emergency.

178
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:07,575
Cranky needs help, STAT.

179
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,145
Hi, Cranky, I have a gift for you!

180
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:26,225
The spa treatment was gift enough.

181
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,515
It's not going to
explode or anything, promise.

182
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,515
Just open it!

183
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,795
It's a new toupee!

184
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,455
I had my friend Rarity make it.

185
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,995
She calls it the "dreamboat special".

186
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:45,425
This is wonderful.
Thanks, kid.

187
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:53,065
He's starting to warm up,
but still no smile.

188
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:59,755
Hey! Whatcha doing there,
ol' buddy ol' pal?

189
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:00,965
What's it look like?

190
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,735
Looks like a yard sale.

191
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:05,005
I'll give you two bits for this!

192
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,995
I'm not selling, kid.
I'm unpacking.

193
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,495
Why didn't you say so?

194
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,485
I thought I had.

195
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:18,635
This is so pretty!
Where'd you get it?

196
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:21,645
Manehattan, now put it down, gently.

197
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,895
Really? What were you doin' there?

198
00:13:23,895 --> 00:13:25,855
Trying to find a friend...

199
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:29,375
I'm always trying to find friends,
and today I found you.

200
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,675
See how good I am at it?

201
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,805
This was a special friend.

202
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:36,695
- Like me?
- No, you're extra special, kid.

203
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,455
Yes, I'm in!

204
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:44,675
Where in Equestria did you get this,
Cranky?

205
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:45,785
Fillydelphia.

206
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,875
It's awfully pretty.

207
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,355
Yes, she was.

208
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:53,245
I mean, it was. I mean, it is.

209
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:55,355
Yes, it's pretty, now put it down!

210
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:01,725
I wonder where Cranky got this.

211
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,225
Will you look at that?

212
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:08,055
Hey, Cranky!
Can I ask you about...

213
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:11,505
Oh no!

214
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,855
What did you sa-yayayayay!

215
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,595
What have you done?!

216
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:23,105
There!
All better?

217
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:27,555
No, not all better, all soggy!

218
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:29,045
I'm sorry, Cranky!

219
00:14:29,045 --> 00:14:33,115
Oh, you're sorry, well, then,
everything is fine!

220
00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:37,275
- It is?
- No! It isn't!

221
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:40,605
Listen to me, kid,
I will never be your friend!

222
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,235
Never, or never-ever?

223
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,895
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!

224
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:54,595
That's four "ever"s.
That's like... forever!

225
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,605
I just can't believe it.

226
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:02,615
Cranky said he would never forever
be my friend.

227
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,085
It was horrible.

228
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:09,285
I know this is hard for you, Pinkie.
Seeing that you're friends with everypony.

229
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:12,635
But you just have to accept that Cranky
is gonna be an exception.

230
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:15,045
He just... doesn't want to be bothered.

231
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:19,075
Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered
by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.

232
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,075
Rainbow!

233
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:24,095
No, no, it's okay, Twilight.
I get what you're saying.

234
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:25,745
What you're both saying.

235
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:29,055
And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone.

236
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:32,535
Right after he accepts my apology!

237
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:41,945
Cranky!

238
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:45,345
No! No!
Leave me alone!

239
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:47,015
Wait!

240
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:49,805
I understand that you don't want me
as a friend!

241
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:51,415
No, I don't!

242
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,835
So I just wanted to say "I'm sorry"!

243
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:55,485
Fine! You said it!

244
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,105
But do you accept my apology?

245
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:57,905
No!

246
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:01,885
Oh Cranky! Please accept my apology!
Please!

247
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:02,685
No!

248
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,125
But I'm really, really, really...

249
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,905
Really, really...

250
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:14,735
Really, really, really...

251
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:19,475
Really, really, really...

252
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:22,455
Really, really, really...

253
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,265
Really, really, really,really...

254
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:32,455
Really. Really. Really. Really.
Really. Really. Really. Really...

255
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:34,005
Sorry!

256
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:49,275
Cranky, please, please accept my apology!

257
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:53,645
I'd do anything to make it up to you!

258
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,555
But there's nothing you can do!

259
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:56,975
You ruined my book!

260
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,125
You destroyed all I have
to remember her by!

261
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,245
Her?
Her who?

262
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:03,995
The special friend?

263
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,785
Go away, Pinkie!

264
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:18,185
Cranky? It's me again.

265
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:22,025
I understand that you don't wanna
be my friend or accept my apology...

266
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,115
Before I leave you alone forever,

267
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:27,945
I have something to at least try
to make up for ruining your book.

268
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,195
No, I don't want it, kid!

269
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:34,035
Anything you would give me is sure
to lead to some sort of disaster!

270
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:37,575
Goodness, you really are cranky.

271
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:51,345
It can't be... is it really you?

272
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:54,095
It can, and it is.

273
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:57,135
Matilda! But how?

274
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:58,825
Pinkie.

275
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:02,315
But... I never told you about her!

276
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,575
You didn't have to.

277
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:07,655
I put two and two and two together
and it added up to Matilda.

278
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:08,455
What?

279
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,635
Well when you were talking about
your souvenirs,

280
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:12,995
you said something about trying to find
a special friend!

281
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:16,855
And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday.

282
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:19,775
My birthday isn't for
another seventy five days!

283
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:24,755
And then, in your scrapbook,
there was a flower, an old ticket,

284
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:26,915
and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala!

285
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:29,555
And I knew I recognized all these things.

286
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:32,205
But how could you have
ever seen them before?

287
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:35,795
Because I also have them in my scrapbook.

288
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:38,965
And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!

289
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,505
Oh, Matilda.

290
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:47,325
The night we met at the gala
was the most magical night of my life.

291
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,525
<i>I couldn't wait to see you again.</i>

292
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:02,825
<i>But when I came to your room
the next day, you were gone.</i>

293
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,415
<i>Didn't you get my note?</i>

294
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:06,905
<i>No, I never got it.</i>

295
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,595
<i>Ever since that day,
I've gone from town...</i>

296
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,715
<i>to town... to town...</i>

297
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:17,295
<i>Searching all over Equestria for you.</i>

298
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:19,745
Until finally I gave up.

299
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:22,975
I came to Ponyville
to retire from my search.

300
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:26,335
I was living in Ponyville
the whole time.

301
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,675
I always hoped that some day
you would come and find me.

302
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:31,675
Doodle.

303
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:35,695
Matilda?
Nopony calls him Doodle...

304
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:38,675
Nopony... but Matilda.

305
00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:48,205
Doodle, I'm so happy to see you.

306
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:05,065
So does this mean
that you accept my apology?

307
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,955
Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology.

308
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:11,535
And, I am honored to call you my friend.

309
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,895
This is just fantastic!

310
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,665
Now we can hang out together,
and chat, and sing songs, and...

311
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:26,665
party!

312
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:28,775
I can throw you guys a big party!

313
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:31,495
It'll be called "Welcome to Ponyville,
I found my lost love...

314
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:33,665
I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie" Party!

315
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:38,925
Or maybe something less over-the-top
and not so super-hyper.

316
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:42,515
Pinkie, we're eternally
grateful to you, but...

317
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:47,315
Matilda and I just want to spend some
time together in peace and quiet.

318
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:49,755
But we're still friends?

319
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:54,085
Pinkie, you went way, way, way
out of your way to make me happy.

320
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:56,045
Of course we're friends.

321
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,005
Great!

322
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,755
<i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>

323
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:03,455
<i>there are many different kinds of friends,</i>

324
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:05,675
<i>and many ways to express friendship.</i>

325
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:08,725
Some friends like to run and laugh
and play together.

326
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,245
<i>But others just like to be left alone,
and that's fine too.</i>

327
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:17,075
<i>But the best thing about friendship
is being able to make your friends smile.</i>

328
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:21,145
<i>He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart</i>

329
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:24,295
<i>She's his Cranky Doodle joy</i>

330
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:27,265
<i>I helped a Cranky Doodle boy, yeah</i>

331
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,735
<i>I helped a Cranky Doodle boy</i>

332
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:30,935
Pinkie!

333
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:33,145
Oops, privacy, sorry.
