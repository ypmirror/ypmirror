1
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:10,545
Come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late
for the Nightmare Night Festival.

2
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:14,635
Huh?

3
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:16,855
Are you...

4
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:20,925
...that one creaky grandpa
from Ponyville Retirement Village?

5
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:23,295
I'm Star Swirl the Bearded.

6
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:27,075
Father of the amniomorphic spell?

7
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:31,935
Did you even read that book I gave you
about obscure unicorn history?

8
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:33,085
Um...

9
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:34,995
That sounds important!

10
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:42,705
<i>Nightmare Night! What a fright!
Give us something sweet to bite!</i>

11
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,725
Hi, everypony. Great costumes.

12
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:49,535
Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.

13
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:52,905
I should have been
asleep five hours ago.

14
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:06,425
Pipsqueak the Pirate, at your service.
It's my very first Nightmare Night.

15
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:08,305
Since you moved here from Trottingham?

16
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:12,225
No. My very first Nightmare Night ever!

17
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:14,885
Enough chitchat! Time is candy!

18
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:17,435
Pinkie Pie, aren't you
a little old for this?

19
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:19,515
Too old for free candy?

20
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:21,075
Never!

21
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,905
Do you like it?

22
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:31,835
Yeah! Great costume, Twilight.

23
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:34,365
Oh, you make a fantastic weirdo clown.

24
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,185
A clown?!

25
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:41,515
Look at the borders on these robes.

26
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,155
These are hoof-stitched!

27
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:44,795
It's a great costume.

28
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,685
...grandpa.

29
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:32,465
Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most
important conjurer of the pre-classical era.

30
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:38,095
He created more than two hundred spells.

31
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:41,885
He even has a shelf in the Canterlot
library of magic named after him.

32
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:46,995
Maybe I should start up a pony group
to teach ponies of our history.

33
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:49,995
I bet everypony would love it.
Don't you, Spike?

34
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:52,755
I love it.

35
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:56,015
Hey, look. We're here already.

36
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:57,595
Should we get something to eat?

37
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:02,055
Twilight! Twilight! Look at our haul!

38
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,395
Can you believe it?

39
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:09,885
And then we went to Cheerilee's house
and we got a bunch more goodies.

40
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,315
-Didn't we, Pip?
-Sure did!

41
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:13,045
And then we had to stop and wait
for Granny Smith and...

42
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,415
Rainbow Dash! That wasn't very nice.

43
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:24,305
Lighten up, old-timer. This is
the best night of the year for pranks.

44
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,075
Look what you did to Spike.

45
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:29,205
Aw, it's all in good fun.

46
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,125
Oh! Oh! There's another group over there!

47
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,305
Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack.

48
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:50,785
Howdy, Spike. Hey, Twilight.
Nice costume.

49
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:52,685
Thanks! I'm a dragon.

50
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,495
She means me, Spike.

51
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:57,805
With that beard, I reckon you're
some sorta country music singer.

52
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:01,535
While y'all are here, you feel like
bobbin' for an apple?

53
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,515
Thank you, everypony.

54
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,665
And welcome to
the Nightmare Night Festival.

55
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:17,955
Now, all the little ponies, who
have been out collecting sweets...

56
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:22,195
...should follow our friend Zecora
to hear the legend of...

57
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:25,005
Nightmare Moooon!

58
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,885
Spooky voice might work better
if she wasn't dressed like that.

59
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:43,765
Follow me and very soon
You'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon.

60
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:51,025
Listen close, my little dears.
I'll tell you where you got your fears.

61
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:54,195
Of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary.

62
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:59,575
Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary.

63
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:07,835
Every year we put on a disguise
To save ourselves from her searching eyes.

64
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:14,355
The Nightmare Moon wants just one thing:

65
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:19,465
To gobble up ponies in one quick swing!

66
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:27,175
Hungrily she soars the sky.
If she sees nopony, she passes by.

67
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:32,715
So if she comes and all is clear,
Equestria is safe another year!

68
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,685
Um... Miss Zecora.

69
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:39,785
If we wear costumes to hide
from Nightmare Moon...

70
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:41,715
...so she won't gobble us up...

71
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:45,015
...how come we still need to
give her some of our candy?

72
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:50,955
A perfect question, my little friend!
For Nightmare Moon you must not offend.

73
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:54,305
Fill up her belly with a treat or two...

74
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:58,425
So she won't return to come eat YOUUU!

75
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:03,265
Everypony! Just dump some
candy and get outta here!

76
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,915
IT'S NIGHTMARE MOON! RUUUN!!!

77
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,415
Princess Luna!

78
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:16,585
CITIZENS OF PONYVILLE!

79
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:20,635
WE HAVE GRACED YOUR TINY
VILLAGE WITH OUR PRESENCE...

80
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:26,205
...SO THAT YOU MIGHT BEHOLD
THE REAL PRINCESS OF THE NIGHT!

81
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:29,455
A CREATURE OF NIGHTMARE IS
NO LONGER, BUT INSTEAD...

82
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:33,095
...A PONY WHO DESIRES
YOUR LOVE AND ADMIRATION.

83
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:35,955
TOGETHER WE SHALL CHANGE
THIS DREADFUL CELEBRATION...

84
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:40,035
...INTO A BRIGHT AND
GLORIOUS FEEEAST!

85
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,735
Did you hear that, everypony?

86
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:45,655
Nightmare Moon says
she's gonna feast on us all!

87
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:51,265
What?!

88
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:55,795
No, children, no! You no longer
have reason to fear us.

89
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:58,625
Screams of delight is
what your princess desires.

90
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,725
Not screams of terror.

91
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,105
Madame Mayor.

92
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:07,615
Thy princess of the night hath arrived.

93
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:16,085
What is the matter with you?

94
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:22,005
Very well then! Be that way!

95
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:25,355
We won't even bother with
the traditional royal farewell.

96
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,005
I'm gonna go talk to her.

97
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,955
You can't talk to her!
She's Nightmare Moon!

98
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:32,205
No, she's not.

99
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:35,305
I saw the Elements of Harmony
change her back to good.

100
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,465
But it seems like she's having
some trouble adjusting...

101
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:40,035
...after being gone
for a thousand years.

102
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,275
Princess Luna?

103
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:50,435
Hi. My name is...

104
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:51,995
Star Swirl the Bearded.

105
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:54,995
Commendable costume.
Thou even got the bells right.

106
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:59,315
Thank you, finally! Somepony
who gets my costume.

107
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:04,595
Uh... I just came to welcome you
to our celebration.

108
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,245
My actual name is...

109
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,415
Twilight Sparkle.

110
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:11,205
IT WAS THOU WHO UNLEASHED
THE POWERS OF HARMONY UPON US...

111
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,635
...AND TOOK AWAY OUR DARK POWERS!

112
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,465
And that was a good thing, right?

113
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:20,115
But of course! We
could not be happier.

114
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,375
Is that not clear?!

115
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,255
Well, you kind of sound
like you're yelling at me.

116
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,305
But this is the traditional
royal Canterlot voice.

117
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:30,195
It is tradition to speak
using the royal "we"...

118
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,935
...and to use THIS MUCH VOLUME
WHEN ADDRESSING OUR SUBJECTS!

119
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:41,145
You know, that might explain why
your appearance was met with...

120
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,015
...mixed results.

121
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,415
I think if you just changed
your approach a bit...

122
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:48,105
...you might be met
with a warmer reception.

123
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,525
CHANGE OUR APPROACH?

124
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:52,745
Or the volume.

125
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:56,265
Oh. We have been locked away
for a thousand years.

126
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:59,165
We are... not sure we can.

127
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:04,985
Don't worry, princess. Fluttershy
can give you some great pointers.

128
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:08,415
She's delicate and demure
with the sweetest little voice.

129
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:12,505
GO AWAY! NO CANDY HERE! VISITORS
NOT WELCOME ON NIGHTMARE NIGHT!

130
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,685
Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!

131
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,495
It is you.

132
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,635
Ah, and Nightmare Moon.

133
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:22,405
Nightmare Moon?!

134
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:26,335
Wait right here.

135
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:35,535
Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?

136
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,235
CHARMED!

137
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:41,845
Likewise...

138
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:45,225
TWILIGHT SPARKLE HATH SPOKEN
OF THE SWEETNESS OF THY VOICE.

139
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:49,245
WE ASK, THOU TEACHEST TO US
TO SPEAK AS THOU SPEAKEST!

140
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,155
Okay...

141
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:51,765
SHALL OUR LESSONS BEGIN?

142
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:52,885
Okay...

143
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,755
SHALL WE MIMIC THY VOICE?

144
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,525
Okay...

145
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:57,015
HOW IS THIS?

146
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,185
Perfect. Lesson over.

147
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:01,895
A little quieter, princess.

148
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:04,555
HOW IS... this?

149
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:06,415
Better. Right, Fluttershy?

150
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:08,905
Yes.

151
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:13,055
How... about... now?

152
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,365
Now you're getting it.

153
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:16,855
And... how about now?

154
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:18,615
Yes! Well done.

155
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:22,245
AH, THANK YOU, DEAR FLUTTERSHY!

156
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:24,215
OUR NORMAL SPEAKING
VOICE SHALL SURELY...

157
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,135
...WIN US THE HEARTS
OF THY FELLOW VILLAGERS.

158
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:28,705
Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us!

159
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,065
Nightmare Moon is here and...

160
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:35,515
She stole Fluttershy's voice so she
can't scream when she GOBBLES HER UP!!!

161
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:39,765
NAY, CHILDREN, WAIT!

162
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:44,275
I mean... nay, children, wait.

163
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:48,175
Come on, princess. Time for plan B.

164
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,035
It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle.

165
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,595
They have never liked us
and they never shall.

166
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:07,825
My friend Applejack is one of the
most likeable ponies around.

167
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:09,735
I'm sure she'll have some ideas.

168
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:11,245
Heee...!

169
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,275
Whoop. Careful there, partner.

170
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,095
Uh... Applejack.

171
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,885
The princess is looking for a little
advice on how to fit in around here.

172
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:25,855
"Fit in"? Really?

173
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:29,175
I mean... that's easy!

174
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:31,455
All you gotta do is have
the right attitude.

175
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:35,435
Loosen up a bit, be positive,
play a few games, have some fun.

176
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:36,145
Fun?

177
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:38,815
What is this "fun" thou speakest of?

178
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:43,875
Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?

179
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,645
Try to land the
sp-sp-spiders on the web.

180
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:54,525
You can do it, princess!

181
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:02,965
Ha! Your princess enjoys this... fun.

182
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,625
In what other ways
may we experience it?

183
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,795
Fire away, princess!

184
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,945
Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!

185
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,605
Why don't you try bobbin' for apples?

186
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:23,225
We got the best apples
in Equestria here, princess.

187
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:26,085
I ask that thou call us... me...

188
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,625
...Luna, fair Applejack.

189
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:33,025
Hear me, villagers!
All of you! Call me Luna!

190
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:37,175
Show me to this bobbing apples.

191
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:39,385
Whoooa...!

192
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:43,055
Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip?

193
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,725
We lost him the last time
we had to run...

194
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:47,995
NIGHTMARE MOON IS
GOBBLING PIPSQUEAK!

195
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,615
EVERYPONY RUUUN!!!

196
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:55,835
Heeelp! My backside has been gobbled!

197
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,355
'Tis a lie!

198
00:13:57,355 --> 00:14:01,815
Thy backside is whole and ungobbled,
thou ungrateful whelp!

199
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,645
Fair villagers, please do not back away.

200
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:10,665
Let us join together in...

201
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:12,325
...fun!

202
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:21,295
Not enough fun for you?
What say you to this?

203
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:37,775
Huzzah! How many points do I receive?

204
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,375
Do not run away!

205
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:48,245
As your princess we command you!

206
00:14:57,045 --> 00:15:00,065
BE STILL!!!

207
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,975
Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!

208
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,185
NO, TWILIGHT SPARKLE!

209
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:13,365
WE MUST USE THE TRADITIONAL
ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE...

210
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,395
...FOR WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO SAY.

211
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,105
SINCE YOU CHOOSE TO FEAR YOUR PRINCESS
RATHER THAN LOVE HER...

212
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:23,365
...AND DISHONOR HER WITH THIS
INSULTING CELEBRATION...

213
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:27,935
...WE DECREE THAT NIGHTMARE
NIGHT SHALL BE CANCELED!

214
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:30,495
FOREVER!

215
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,115
Shoot. We had everything goin' our way.

216
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:45,395
Luna was happy, everypony in town
was happy. Now look at 'em.

217
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:49,775
But I wanted to be a zombie next year!

218
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:54,975
It's not over yet.

219
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:56,395
What are you gonna do?

220
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,875
I'm going to do what I do best.

221
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:00,455
Lecture her!

222
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:10,785
Princess.

223
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:12,905
Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle.

224
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,775
Princess. I'm sorry it hasn't
worked out how we wanted.

225
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,995
But you have to believe me when
I tell you that Nightmare Night...

226
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:23,145
...is one of the most popular
celebrations we have.

227
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:24,895
Yes. I can tell.

228
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:29,115
By all the adoring shrieks
of the children as they run away.

229
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:31,725
Princess.

230
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:55,565
No! No shrieking. No squealing
or screaming either. Okay?

231
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:56,665
Okay.

232
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,025
There's something I want you to see.

233
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:02,655
And I promise that it's safe, but you
really, really, really can't shriek.

234
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,365
Do you promise not to shriek?

235
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:16,385
Pinkie Pie, you remember
Princess Luna, right?

236
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:19,915
Ah. The ringleader of the
frightened children.

237
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,835
Hast thou come to make peace?

238
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,465
Nightmare Moon!

239
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,065
Rainbow!

240
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:45,335
She's changed, Pinkie!
She's not evil or scary anymore!

241
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:47,965
And she definitely doesn't
want to gobble you up!

242
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,915
Well, duh.

243
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:51,715
Huh?

244
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:53,365
I know that. Sheesh, Twilight.

245
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,335
I'm almost as big as her.
How's she gonna gobble me up?

246
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,825
So why do you keep
running away and screaming?

247
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:02,025
Sometimes it's just
really fun to be scared.

248
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:04,095
Fun?

249
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:07,725
Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!

250
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:09,175
No, I'm not. I'm a chicken.

251
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:12,425
Princess Luna!
I've finally figured out...

252
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,935
...why you're having
so much trouble being liked!

253
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:18,065
Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.

254
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:21,265
Come with me. I'll explain
everything on the way.

255
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:26,915
Gosh. I never thought my
very first Nightmare Night...

256
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,645
...would be my very last.

257
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:35,135
Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret.
Nightmare Night's not over yet.

258
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:40,685
We still have candy left to give,
So Nightmare Moon might let us live.

259
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:43,625
Yes. Come on, little ponies.

260
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,715
What's Nightmare Night without
the annual candy offering?

261
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:50,555
You don't want Nightmare Moon
to gobble you up...

262
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:52,515
...dooo youuu?

263
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:56,325
Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me.

264
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:59,515
Come on, kids!
Doesn't that sound like fun?

265
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:10,415
Goodbye, Nightmare Night.

266
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,205
Forever.

267
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:16,095
CITIZENS OF PONYVILLE!

268
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:19,325
YOU WERE WISE TO BRING THIS CANDY TO ME.

269
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,595
I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR OFFERING.

270
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:24,265
SO PLEASED THAT I MAY JUST EAT IT...

271
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:27,245
...INSTEAD OF EATING YOU!

272
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:39,155
I am not certain that did what
you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle.

273
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:40,605
Just wait.

274
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:43,965
For what? For... for them
to scream some more?

275
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:46,165
Um... Princess Luna.

276
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,385
I know there's not gonna be
any more Nightmare Night...

277
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:52,955
...but do you suppose maybe
you could come back next year...

278
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:55,015
...and scare us again anyway?

279
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:59,085
Child. Are thou saying that thou...

280
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:01,455
...likest me to scare you?

281
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:04,725
It's really fun! Scary, but fun.

282
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,105
It... is?

283
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:09,675
Yeah! Nightmare Night is my
favorite night of the year.

284
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,745
Well then. We shall have to bring...

285
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:15,525
...NIGHTMARE NIGHT BACK!

286
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:16,765
Whoa!

287
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:19,865
You're my favorite princess ever!

288
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:22,995
She said yes, guys!

289
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:24,225
YAY!

290
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:27,275
See? They really do like you, princess.

291
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:29,375
Can it be true?

292
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:33,025
OH, MOST WONDERFUL OF...

293
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,345
I mean...

294
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:38,355
Oh, most wonderful of nights.

295
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,735
"Dear Princess Celestia."

296
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:44,535
"When you first sent me to Ponyville,
I didn't know anything about friendship."

297
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,615
"I met somepony tonight who
was having the same problem..."

298
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,785
"...your sister, Princess Luna."

299
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:52,755
"She taught me that one of the best
things you can do with friendship..."

300
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:56,185
"...is to give it to others and
help them find it themselves."

301
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:59,175
"And I'm happy to report that
all of Ponyville has learned..."

302
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,365
"...that even if somepony seems
a little intimidating, even scary..."

303
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:07,775
"...when you offer them your friendship,
you'll discover a whole new pony underneath."

304
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:11,585
"And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded
costume didn't go over..."

305
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:15,325
"...this still turned out to be
the best Nightmare Night ever."

306
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:36,795
