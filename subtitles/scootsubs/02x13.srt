1
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,645
Can you believe the new baby is finally here?

2
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,945
Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!

3
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:17,305
I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?

4
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:22,465
I wanna see the new baby pony!
I wanna see! Which one is it?!

5
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:27,505
Meet our son, Pound Cake.

6
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:35,575
And our daughter, Pumpkin Cake.

7
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:40,975
Two new foals for me to play with?

8
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:43,575
That's two, two, two times the fun!

9
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:45,525
This is the greatest day ever!

10
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:48,345
We need to celebrate your birthday, babies!

11
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:50,665
'Cause you were just born today!

12
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:54,875
Shhh. The babies are trying to sleep.

13
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:56,785
- But I was just...
- Shhh.

14
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:59,295
- But...
- Shhh!

15
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,055
Happy happy birthday,
to you and you today!

16
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:12,485
Now, how in thunderation is one of them twins a pegasus...

17
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:14,615
...and the other one a unicorn?

18
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:18,405
Easy. My great great great great
grandfather was a unicorn.

19
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:22,605
And Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin
twice removed was a pegasus.

20
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:23,995
That makes sense, right?

21
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:27,015
Aw yeah, just you wait!

22
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,885
Once little Pound Cake gets his wings going...

23
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,825
...he'll be all over the place!

24
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,945
And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.

25
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:36,395
Baby unicorns get strange magic
surges that come and go.

26
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,135
Quick! Make a wish and
blow out your candles!

27
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:40,895
Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles!

28
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:44,425
- You are zero years old, after all!
- Shhh!

29
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:21,355


30
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:35,295
Happy monthiversary
to you and you today!

31
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:37,245
I can't believe you're already
a month old time sure flies...

32
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,845
...it seems like only yesterday you weren't born!

33
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:42,165
But now you're a month old today, hey!

34
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:53,145
Are you ready for your favoritest
game in the whole wide world?

35
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,895
Where's Pinkie Pie...?

36
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,375
Here I am!

37
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,055
Where's Pinkie Pie...?

38
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,575
Here I am!

39
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:05,995
Where's Pinkie Pie...?
Here I am!

40
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,515
Here I am!

41
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:12,365
Here I am!

42
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:14,845
Everything okay in there?

43
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:17,255
Who needs a diaper change?

44
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:19,775
Don't worry, they're fine!

45
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,005
I mean...

46
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:25,345
I got it.

47
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:43,545
Is anypony hungry?

48
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:46,035
No thanks.
I just had a big breakfast.

49
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:47,215
I'm on it.

50
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:05,885
You're making funny faces!
I have one!

51
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:10,685
No, you see, Pinkie, the babies need to be burped.

52
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:17,605
All set now?
Everything good?

53
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,905
Okay, who wants to play again?

54
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:29,665
Pound Cake, no pounding things.

55
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,565
We don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake.

56
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:39,965
Except food.

57
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:44,045
Food! Great cinnamon sticks,
I completely forgot!

58
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:46,235
No, you just fed them bottles, remember?

59
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:48,295
Not the babies' food!

60
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:52,305
The food for the enormously big catering
order we have to deliver today!

61
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:55,865
With the new twins, we've been so distracted!

62
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,025
Quick, honeybun!

63
00:04:57,025 --> 00:05:00,495
We need to find a babysitter to watch
the foals while we take care of this.

64
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:03,485
I could do it!
I wanna do it!

65
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,615
The babies love playing with me, I'll do it!

66
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:09,015
Wonder who would be available
on such short notice...

67
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:11,425
Me! Me!
Pick me!

68
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,685
I would love to babysit!

69
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:18,855
But I can't today, sorry.

70
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:21,195
I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic.

71
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:24,125
You understand, don't you?

72
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,875
You're not mad at me, are you?
Please don't be mad at me!

73
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,635
I'll do it!
Pick me!

74
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:33,865
I have to finish this report for the Princess...

75
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:36,745
...summarizing all my other reports to the Princess.

76
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,025
I wanna babysit!
Pick me!

77
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,715
Babysit?
Now?

78
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,595
When there's a swarm a' hungry
caterpillars headed this way?

79
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:53,045
I gotta get all these apples picked
before they get swarmed on!

80
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,855
I wanna do it!

81
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,745
I got tickets to the Wonderbolts
airshow this afternoon.

82
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:04,945
Gotta dash!

83
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:11,025
Ask me!
Mememememememememe!

84
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:16,785
Moi?
Babysit?

85
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,785
Nononononono.

86
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:22,215
I'm flattered that you would think about me though.

87
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:34,495
Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us.

88
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,305
I dunno.
I'll have to check my schedule.

89
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:48,135
Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand

90
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:51,185
the responsibility of watching over two babies?

91
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:55,455
I can be responsible.
Why, responsibility is my middle name.

92
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:57,595
Pinkie Responsibility Pie!

93
00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:00,485
But this time you need to take care of them.

94
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:02,445
Not just play with them.

95
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:04,915
You have to be responsible.

96
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:08,745
Yes, I know.
I will, I am.

97
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:13,625
Here you are, dearie.

98
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,635
All your responsibilities are on this list.

99
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:21,205
That's a lot of responsi...
Consider it done.

100
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,675
We'll frost it when we get there!

101
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,965
C'mon, sugarplum, tick tick!

102
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:31,155
Take good care of our two precious little ginger snaps!

103
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,765
No problemo, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

104
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:36,035
Everything is under control.

105
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,325
Don't cry, little friends!
Look, look!

106
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,235
Where's Pinkie Pie?
Where's Pinkie Pie?

107
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:06,995
Oh no... I'm right here, see!

108
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:16,895
Think, think, think...

109
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:21,745
Hey guys, watch this!

110
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,835
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight!

111
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,035
Where y'all from?

112
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:30,645
Well, that's great.

113
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:33,355
Y'know, I used to have an ant farm,
but I had to get rid of it...

114
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:36,695
...because I couldn't find tractors that small!

115
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:40,295
Get it?

116
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:43,145
Tractors that small?

117
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:48,605
The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog.

118
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,585
And now I can't find him!

119
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:58,265
Gee, tough crowd.

120
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:00,215
Tell me about it.

121
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:04,655
Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper...

122
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:08,605
...but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!

123
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:12,125
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

124
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,085
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

125
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,945
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

126
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,785
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

127
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:19,615
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

128
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,405
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

129
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:23,095
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

130
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,875
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

131
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,445
First you wiggle your tail, oink oink oink

132
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:28,105
Then you wriggle your snout, oink oink oink

133
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:29,645
Then you wriggle your rump, oink oink oink

134
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,285
Then shout it out, oink oink oink

135
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,775
There, see?

136
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,385
Nothing to this babysitting business!

137
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:51,215
Snack time.
That's easy enough.

138
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:56,325
Okie dokie!

139
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:57,775
Eat up!

140
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,335
Like this!

141
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:15,345
No, Pumpkin Cake.
We eat food, not tablecloths.

142
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:26,005
Hey guys, look at me!

143
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:41,035
Yeah.... I think I can see
where this is going.

144
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,845
Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!

145
00:10:57,965 --> 00:10:58,905
Stop it...

146
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:00,205
Stop it...

147
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:02,055
Stop it!

148
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,305
Look guys, bubbles!

149
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,375
Don't cry, look, look, floating things!

150
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,945
Don't make me do it, guys.

151
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:12,905
You know what happens when you
mix flour and water, don't you?

152
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:38,085
Smells like somepony needs me
to changie-wangie their...

153
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:42,225
...diaper-wiper right now-ow-ow!

154
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:54,235
Easy... easy...

155
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,375
Stand still, I've almost...

156
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,995
You've gotta be kidding me.

157
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,695
Thank goodness they're home!

158
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:34,935
Hi!
I finished up the work I had to do...

159
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:37,515
...so I thought I'd stop by and
see if you needed any help.

160
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,995
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for coming!

161
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,995
I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like...

162
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:45,335
...I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason!

163
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:48,785
And don't even get me started on
their taste in stand-up comedy.

164
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:52,215
It's okay, Pinkie.
I figured you'd need some help.

165
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:53,685
That's why I stopped by.

166
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:55,505
Excuse me?!

167
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:57,625
Babies take a lot of work.

168
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,315
And some ponies are just not cut out
to handle the responsibility.

169
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:03,925
Is that so?

170
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:07,145
Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight.

171
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:08,735
Sorry, I don't have time to visit.

172
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:12,435
I'm very very busy with
my 'responsibilities' here.

173
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,035
I'm happy to help!
It's no trouble.

174
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:20,665
Well, she thinks I can't handle things on my own!

175
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:24,555
Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own.

176
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:29,285
Well, I can handle things on my own!

177
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:42,355
Pound Cake.

178
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,155
This is a crib.

179
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:45,995
It is only to be used for napping, sleeping...

180
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,215
...and on occasion with permission...

181
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,015
...as a pretend old-timey Western fort.

182
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,375
It is not a trampoline.

183
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,775
So stop your jumping right now, mister!

184
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,595
And you, young filly.

185
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,005
We do not put anything in our mouth...

186
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,305
...that we cannot safely and properly digest.

187
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:03,115
So stop slobbering on that toy, this instant!

188
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:10,275
Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon...

189
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:13,075
...and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap.

190
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:15,565
So, fall asleep!

191
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:28,555
Sleep tight.

192
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:40,065
Now that's what I call handling things.

193
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,775
Oh, nononono.

194
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,175
Not good, not good, not good!

195
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,515
Pound? Pumpkin?
Where are you?

196
00:15:57,765 --> 00:15:59,935
Come out, wherever you are!

197
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:15,385
You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin...

198
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:18,435
...and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!

199
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:35,305
Pound Cake?

200
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:37,295
Here, Pound Cake!

201
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:49,795
Pound Cake?

202
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:12,605
You can fly?!

203
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:21,085
Get down here, this instant, young colt!

204
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,405
I'm responsible for you!

205
00:17:57,105 --> 00:17:59,495
No no no, Pumpkin.

206
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:04,315
No no.

207
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,135
No.

208
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:12,205
I am the responsible one, and I said no.

209
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,905
That goes for you too, Pound Cake!

210
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:26,885
Gotcha!

211
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:28,755
I think?

212
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:42,405
Mhh, raspberry.

213
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:49,075
I'm not letting go!
I'm responsible!

214
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:07,285
Oh, not you too!

215
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:18,745
There!
Now who's the responsible one?

216
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:10,455
Y'know, you're right.
That is funny.

217
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,815
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

218
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,235
"I've always had fun playing with little kids..."

219
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:23,485
"...and I thought babysitting
meant just more playtime, right?"

220
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:24,685
"Wrong!"

221
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:27,715
"Being a caregiver is way more responsibility..."

222
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:29,585
"...than just being a playmate."

223
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:33,625
"And today I learned that sometimes,
our desire for responsibility..."

224
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,615
"...can outrun our actual ability to handle it."

225
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,205
Pinkie Pie!
We're back!

226
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:40,855
How did everything go?

227
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:47,505
Are we in the right place?

228
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:48,805
Shhh!

229
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,875
Pinkie!
This is just... just...

230
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,145
...amazing, is what it is!

231
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:05,055
We had no idea how responsible you really are.

232
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:11,755
Would you be interested in becoming our
go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?

233
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:15,425
Let me check my schedule!

234
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:19,255
I should be available a week from... never!

235
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:25,365
- Pinkie...
- Pie...

236
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,975
I have some free time next Tuesday.
