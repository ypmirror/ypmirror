1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,400
Once upon a time,
in the magical land of Equestria,

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,760
There were two regal sisters
who ruled together

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,170
And created harmony
for all the land.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,810
To do this, the eldest
used her unicorn powers

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,640
To raise the sun at dawn.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,080
The younger brought out the moon
to begin the night.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,780
Thus, the two sisters
maintained balance

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,810
For their kingdom
and their subjects --

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,870
All the different types
of ponies.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,690
But as time went on, the younger
sister became resentful.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,990
The ponies relished and played

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,910
In the day
her elder sister brought forth

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,930
But shunned and slept
through her beautiful night.

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,200
One fateful day,
the younger unicorn

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,850
Refused to lower the moon
to make way for the dawn.

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,510
The elder sister
tried to reason with her,

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,200
But the bitterness
in the young one's heart

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,170
Had transformed her into
a wicked mare of darkness --

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,530
Nightmare Moon.

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,380
She vowed that she would shroud
the land in eternal night.

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,290
Reluctantly, the elder sister

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,920
Harnessed the most powerful
magic known to ponydom --

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,680
The Elements of Harmony.

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,460
Using the magic
of the Elements of Harmony,

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,430
She defeated her younger sister

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,690
And banished her permanently
on the moon.

27
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,820
The elder sister took on
responsibility...

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,740
For both sun and moon...

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,190
and harmony has been
maintained in Equestria

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
For generations since.

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,970
Hmm, Elements of Harmony.

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,360
I know
I've heard of those before.

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,020
But where?

34
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,670
* My Little Pony

35
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,410
* My Little Pony

36
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,600
* Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah

37
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,520
* My Little Pony

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
* I used to wonder
What friendship could be *

39
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,700
* My Little Pony

40
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,080
* Until you all shared
This magic with me *

41
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,170
* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
* A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong *

43
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,370
* Sharing kindness
* It's an easy feat

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,400
* And magic
Makes it all complete *

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,670
* Yeah, My Little Pony

46
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:11,450
* Do you know you're all
My very best friends? *

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,820
There you are, Twilight.

48
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,160
Moondancer is having
a little get-Together

49
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,490
In the west castle
courtyard.

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,510
You want to come?

51
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,410
Oh, sorry, girls.

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,130
I got a lot of studying
to catch up on.

53
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,940
Does that pony
do anything except study?

54
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,110
I think she's more interested
in books than friends.

55
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,040
I know I've heard
of the Elements of Harmony.

56
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,120
Ugh!

57
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,560
Spike! Spike!

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
Spike?

59
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,480
There you are.

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,940
Quick, find me that old copy
of "Predictions and Prophecies."

61
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,870
What's that for?

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,940
Well...

63
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,320
it was a gift
for Moondancer, but...

64
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,500
Oh, Spike, you know
we don't have time

65
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,420
For that sort of thing.

66
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,800
But we're on a break.

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,100
No. No.

68
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,900
No.
No, no, no.

69
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,840
Ugh!

70
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,810
Spike!

71
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,060
It's over here.

72
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,630
Ah!

73
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,630
Elements, elements.

74
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,810
"E," "e," "e."

75
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,550
Aha!

76
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,250
"Elements of Harmony.

77
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,150
See mare in the moon"?

78
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,860
Mare in the moon?

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,700
But that's just
an old ponies' tale.

80
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,090
Mare, mare.
Aha!

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,470
"The mare in the moon --
Myth from olden pony times,

82
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,260
"A powerful pony
who wanted to rule Equestria

83
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,160
"Defeated by the elements
of harmony

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,380
And imprisoned in the moon."

85
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,360
"Legend has it that on the
longest day of the 1,000th year,

86
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,200
"The stars will aid
in her escape,

87
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,430
And she will bring about
nighttime eternal."

88
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,930
Spike!
Do you know what this means?

89
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,770
No. Whoa!

90
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,750
Ow!

91
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,530
Take a note, please,
to the princess.

92
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,070
Okeydokey.

93
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,860
My dearest teacher,

94
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,050
My continuing studies
of pony magic

95
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,260
Have led me to discover

96
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,330
That we are on the precipice
of disaster.

97
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,250
Hold on.

98
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,490
"Preci-- Preci--"

99
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,060
Threshold.

100
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,270
"Thre--"

101
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,500
Uh, brink?

102
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:36,820
Ugh!

103
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,980
That something really bad
is about to happen.

104
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,990
For, you see, the mythical mare
in the moon

105
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,670
Is, in fact,
Nightmare Moon,

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,830
And she's about to return
to Equestria

107
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,690
And bring
with her eternal night.

108
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,360
Something must be done to make
sure this terrible prophecy

109
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,730
Does not come true.

110
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,190
I await
your quick response.

111
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,900
Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle.

112
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,810
"Twilight...Sparkle."

113
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,920
Got it!
Great. Send it.

114
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,860
Now?
Of course.

115
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,360
Uh, I don't know, Twilight.

116
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,220
Princess Celestia's
a little busy

117
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,340
Getting ready
for the Summer Sun Celebration.

118
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,400
And it's like
the day after tomorrow.

119
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,720
That's just it, Spike.

120
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,920
The day after tomorrow
is the 1,000th year

121
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,540
Of the Summer Sun Celebration.

122
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,460
It's imperative that
the princess is told right away.

123
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,030
"Impera-- Impera--"

124
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,820
Important!

125
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,940
Aah-Aah!

126
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,880
Okay, okay!

127
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,130
There.
It's on its way.

128
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,600
But I wouldn't hold
your breath.

129
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,100
Oh, I'm not worried,
Spike.

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,130
The princess trusts me
completely.

131
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,900
In all the years
she's been my mentor,

132
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,660
She's never once
doubted me.

133
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,140
See?

134
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,260
I knew she would want to take
immediate action.

135
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,530
"My dearest, most faithful
student, Twilight,

136
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,880
"You know that I value
your diligence

137
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,730
And that I trust you
completely."
Mm-Hmm.

138
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,960
"But you simply must stop
reading those dusty old books."

139
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,640
"My dear Twilight,

140
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,290
"There is more to a young pony's
life than studying.

141
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,100
"So I'm sending you to supervise
the preparations

142
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,860
"For
the Summer Sun Celebration

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,540
"In this year's location,
Ponyville.

144
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,460
"And I have
an even more essential task

145
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,810
"For you to complete...

146
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,810
make some friends."

147
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,120
Look on the bright side,
Twilight.

148
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,600
The princess arranged for you
to stay in a library.

149
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,180
Doesn't that make you
happy?

150
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,450
Yes! Yes, it does.

151
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,060
You know why?
Because I'm right.

152
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,290
I'll check on the preparations
as fast as I can,

153
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,540
Then get to the library

154
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,270
To find some proof
of Nightmare Moon's return.

155
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,530
Then when will you make friends,
like the princess said?

156
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,670
She said to check on
preparations.

157
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,060
I am her student,
and I'll do my royal duty,

158
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,190
But the fate of Equestria

159
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,940
Does not rest
on me making friends.

160
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,250
Thank you, sirs.

161
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,070
Maybe the ponies
in Ponyville

162
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,870
Have interesting things
to talk about.

163
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,470
Come on, Twilight.
Just try.

164
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,470
Uh...

165
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,760
hello?

166
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,510
Well, that was interesting,
all right.

your acquaintance.

making new friends.

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,020
Actually, I, uh...

00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,830

Well, I am, in fact, here
to supervise preparations

183
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,660
For the Summer Sun Celebration.

184
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,350
And you're in charge
of the food?

185
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,020
We sure as sugar are.

186
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,270
Would you care
to sample some?

187
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,630
As long as it doesn't take
too long.

188
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,730
Soup's on, everypony!

189
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,050
Now, why don't I introduce y'all
to the apple family?

190
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,050
Thanks, but I really need
to hurry.

191
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,250
This here's
Apple Fritter.

192
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,930
Apple Bumpkin.

193
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,310
Red Gala.

194
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,860
Red Delicious.
Golden Delicious.

195
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,140
Caramel Apple.
Apple Strudel.

196
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,240
Apple Tart.
Baked Apples.

197
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,690
Apple Brioche.
Apple Cinnamon Crisp.

198
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,690
Big Macintosh.

199
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,980
Apple Bloom.
And...Granny Smith.

200
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,710
Up and at 'em,
Granny Smith.

201
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,060
We got guests.

202
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,740
What?

203
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,960
Soup's on?

204
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,230
I'm, uh, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

205
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,580
Why, I'd say they're already
part of the family.

206
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,970
Bleh!

207
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,020
Okay, well, I can see
the food situation is handled,

208
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,690
So we'll be on our way.

209
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,020
Aren't you gonna stay
for brunch?

210
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,910
Sorry.
But we have an awful lot to do.

211
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,140
Fine.

212
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,740
Food's all taken care of.
Next is weather.

213
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,450
I ate too much pie.

214
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,360
Hmm.

215
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,460
There's supposed to be a pegasus
pony named Rainbow Dash

216
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,630
Clearing the clouds.

217
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,750
Well, she's not doing
a very good job, is she?

218
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,740
Uh, excuse me?

219
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,450
Mm.

220
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,330
Let me help you.

221
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,290
Oops.
I guess I overdid it.

222
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,660
Um, uh, how about this?

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,210
My very own patented
Rainblow Dry.

224
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,350
No, no.
Don't thank me.

225
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,810
You're quite welcome.

226
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,740
Let me guess --
You're Rainbow Dash.

227
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,190
The one and only.

228
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,250
Why? You heard of me?

229
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,860
I heard you're supposed to be
keeping the sky clear.

230
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,490
I'm Twilight Sparkle,

231
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,370
And the princess sent me
to check on the weather.

232
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,350
Yeah, yeah.
That'll be a snap.

233
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,620
I'll do it in a jiffy,

234
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,490
Just as soon
as I'm done practicing.

235
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,040
Practicing? For what?

236
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,140
The Wonderbolts.

237
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,820
They're gonna perform
at the celebration tomorrow,

238
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,980
And I'm gonna show them
my stuff.

239
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,300
The Wonderbolts?
Yep.

240
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,720
The most talented fliers
in all of Equestria?

241
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,830
That's them.

242
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,140
Please.

243
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,730
They'd never accept
a pegasus

244
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,520
Who can't even keep the sky
clear for one measly day.

245
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,290
Hey, I could clear this sky
in 10 seconds flat.

246
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,880
Prove it.

247
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,720
Hyah!
Loop the loop around and whap!

248
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,220
What'd I say?

249
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,800
10 seconds flat.

250
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,180
I'd never leave
Ponyville hanging.

251
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,230
You should see
the look on your face.

252
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,230
Ha!

253
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,220
You're a laugh,
Twilight Sparkle.

254
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,060
I can't wait to hang out
some more.

255
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
Wow!

256
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,580
She's amazing!

257
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,970
Wait! It's kind of pretty
once you get used to it.

258
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,380
Decorations.

259
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,630
Beautiful!
Yes.

260
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,600
The decor
is coming along nicely.

261
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,640
This ought to be quick.

262
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,710
I'll be at the library
in no time.

263
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,170
Beautiful, indeed.

264
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,650
Not the decor -- Her.

265
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
No, no.

266
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,030
No.

267
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,780
Oh, goodness, no.

268
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,420
How are my spines?
Are they straight?

269
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,810
Good afternoon.

270
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,780
Just a moment, please.

271
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,870
I'm in the zone,
as it were.

272
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,160
Oh, yes!

273
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,880
Sparkle always does the trick,
does it not?

274
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,980
Why, Rarity,
you are a talent.

275
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,070
Now, um, how can I help you --
Aah-Ha-Ha!

276
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,090
Oh, my stars, darling!

277
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,270
Whatever happened
to your coiffure?

278
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,120
Oh, you mean my mane?

279
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,600
Well, it's a long story.

280
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm just here to check
on the decorations,

281
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,690
And then I'll be
out of your hair.

282
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,120
Out of my hair?

283
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,900
What about your hair?

284
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,050
Wait.
Where are we going?

285
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,070
Help!

286
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,740
No. No. Unh-Unh.

287
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,740
Too green.
Too yellow.

288
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,610
Too poofy.
Not poofy enough.

289
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,820
Too frilly.
Too shiny.

290
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,130
Now go on, my dear.

291
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,650
You were telling me
where you're from.

292
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,470
I've...

293
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,330
Been sent...from Canterlot...
to --

294
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,540
Huh?

295
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,300
Canterlot?!

296
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,020
Oh, I am so envious.

297
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,590
The glamour,
the sophistication.

298
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,610
I've always dreamed
of living there.

299
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,860
I can't wait to hear
all about it.

300
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,180
We are gonna be the best
of friends, you and I.

301
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,560
Emeralds?!
What was I thinking?

302
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,580
Let me get you
some rubies.

303
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,500
Quick, before she decides to dye
my coat a new color.

304
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,350
Wasn't she wonderful?

305
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,030
Focus, Casanova.

306
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,200
What's next
on the list?

307
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,570
Oh, uh, music.

308
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,820
It's the last one.

309
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,710
Oh, my.
Um, stop, please, everyone.

310
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,920
Um...excuse me, sir.

311
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,010
I mean no offense,

312
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,030
But your rhythm is just
a teeny, tiny bit off.

313
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,720
Now follow me, please.

314
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,850
A-one, a-two,
a-One, Two, Three.

315
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,100
Hello!

316
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,720
Oh, my.
I'm so sorry.

317
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,340
I didn't mean to frighten
your birds.

318
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm just here to check up
on the music,

319
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,940
And it sounded beautiful.

320
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,310
I'm Twilight Sparkle.

321
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,410
What's your name?

322
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,590
Um...I'm...

323
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,230
I'm sorry.
What was that?

324
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,290
Um...my name is...

325
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,990
Didn't quite catch that.

326
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,150
Well, um, it looks like
your birds are back.

327
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,700
So I guess
everything's in order.

328
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,940
Keep up the good work.

329
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,940
Okay.

330
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,300
Well, that was easy.

331
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,090
A baby dragon!

332
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,530
Oh, I've never seen
a baby dragon before.

333
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,020
He's so cute.

334
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,820
Well, well, well.

335
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,880
Oh, my.
He talks.

336
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,830
I didn't know
dragons could talk.

337
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,280
That's just
so incredibly wonderful.

338
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,110
I-I just don't even know
what to say.

339
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,810
Well, in that case,
we better be going.

340
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,190
Wait, wait.

341
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,490
What's his name?

342
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,420
I'm Spike.

343
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,930
Hi, Spike.
I'm Fluttershy.

344
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,770
Wow, a talking dragon.

345
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,890
And what do dragons
talk about?

346
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,640
Well, what do you want
to know?

347
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,780
Absolutely everything.

348
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,400
Well, I started out

349
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,410
As a cute little
purple-And-Green egg.

350
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,230
And that's the story
of my whole entire life...

351
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,810
well, up until today.

352
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,440
Do you want to hear
about today?

353
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,420
Oh, yes, please.

354
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,030
Wuh!

355
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,460
I am so sorry.

356
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,500
How did we get here
so fast?

357
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,590
This is where I'm staying
while in Ponyville,

358
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,200
And my poor baby dragon
needs his sleep.

359
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,630
No, I don't.
Aah!

360
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,650
Aww!
Wook at that.

361
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,800
He's so sweepy, he can't even
keep his wittle bawance.

362
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,190
Poor thing.

363
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,140
You simply must get him
to bed.

364
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,210
Yes, yes.
We'll get right on that.

365
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,950
Well, good night.

366
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,210
Huh. Rude much?

367
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,000
Sorry, Spike, but I have to
convince the princess

368
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,150
That Nightmare Moon
is coming,

369
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,370
And we're running
out of time.

370
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,330
I just need to be alone
so I can study

371
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,730
Without a bunch
of crazy ponies

372
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,040
Trying to make friends
all the time.

373
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,280
Now, where's the light?

374
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,330
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!

375
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,390
Surprise!

376
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,730
Hi.
I'm Pinkie Pie.

377
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,260
And I threw this party
just for you.

378
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,240
Were you surprised?
Were you, were you?
Huh? Huh? Huh?

379
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,530
Very surprised.

380
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,750
Libraries are supposed to be
quiet.

381
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,820
That's silly.

382
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,030
What kind of welcome party
would this be if it were quiet?

383
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,490
I mean, duh!
Boring!

384
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,330
You see, I saw you when you
first got here, remember?

385
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,970
You were all, "hello."
And I was all [gasps]

386
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,690
Remember?
You see, I never saw you before.

387
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,360
And if I never saw you before,
that means you're new,

388
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,350
'Cause I know everypony, and
i mean everypony, in Ponyville.

389
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,130
And if you're new,
you hadn't met anyone yet.

390
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,270
And if you haven't met
anyone yet, you must
not have any friends.

391
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,980
And if you don't have
any friends, then
you must be lonely.

392
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,020
And that made me so sad.
And I had an idea.

393
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,680
And that's why I went

394
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,260
"I should throw
a great, big, ginormous,

395
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,830
Super-Duper, spectacular
welcome party

396
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,750
And invite everyone
in Ponyville."

397
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,740
See? And now you have
lots and lots of friends.

398
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,370
Are you all right,
sugar cube?

399
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,000
Aww!
She's so happy, she's crying.

400
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,190
Hot sauce.

401
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,990
Ooh.

402
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,900
What?
This is good.

403
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,980
Ugh.
Hey, Twilight,

404
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,190
Pinkie Pie's starting
"pin the tail on the pony."

405
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,730
Want to play?
No!

406
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,700
All the ponies in this town
are crazy!

407
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,260
Do you know
what time it is?

408
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,450
It's the eve
of the Summer Sun Celebration.

409
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,930
Everypony has to stay up,

410
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,830
Or they'll miss
the princess raise the sun.

411
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,210
You really should lighten up,
Twilight.

412
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,470
It's a party.

413
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,090
Ugh! Here, I thought
I'd have time

414
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,360
To learn more about the elements
of harmony, but silly me.

415
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,380
All this ridiculous
friend-making

416
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,440
Has kept me from it.

417
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,900
Legend has it that on the
longest day of the 1,000th year,

418
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,780
The stars will aid
in her escape,

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,140
And she will bring about
everlasting night.

420
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,210
I hope the princess was right.

421
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,910
I hope it really is
just an old pony tale.

422
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,100
Come on, Twilight!

423
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,590
It's time to watch
the sun rise.

424
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,380
Isn't this exciting?

425
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,820
Are you excited?
'Cause I'm excited.

426
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,790
I've never been
so excited.

427
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,880
Well, except for the time that i
saw you walking into town,

428
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,710
And I went [gasps]

429
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,550
But, I mean, really,
who can top that?

430
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,430
Fillies and gentlecolts,
as mayor of Ponyville,

431
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,290
It is my great pleasure
to announce the beginning

432
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,750
Of the summer sun
celebration.

433
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,500
In just a few moments,
our town

434
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,630
Will witness
the magic of the sunrise

435
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,490
And celebrate this,
the longest day of the year.

436
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,150
And now, it is my great honor
to introduce to you

437
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,570
The ruler of our land,

438
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,910
The very pony who gives us
the sun and the moon

439
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,020
Each and every day,

440
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,950
The good, the wise,

441
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,130
The bringer of harmony
to all of Equestria...

442
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,970
ready?

443
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,340
...princess Celestia!

444
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,970
Huh?

445
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,090
This can't be good.

446
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,590
Remain calm, everypony.

447
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,830
There must be
a reasonable explanation.

448
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,980
Ooh, ooh!
I love guessing games.

449
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,260
Is she hiding?

450
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,500
She's gone!

451
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,130
Ooh, she's good.

452
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,450
Aah!

453
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,940
Oh, no.

454
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,190
Nightmare Moon.

455
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,760
Oh!

456
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,810
Oh, my beloved subjects.

457
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,420
It's been so long

458
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,180
Since I've seen your precious
little sun-Loving faces.

459
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,320
What did you do
with our princess?

460
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,380
Slow down, nelly.

461
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,960
Why?

462
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,450
Am I not royal enough
for you?

463
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,890
Don't you know who I am?

464
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,470
Ooh, ooh!
More guessing games.

465
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,050
Um, Hokey Smokes.

466
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,710
How about Queen Meanie?

467
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,760
No.
Black Snooty, Black Snooty!

468
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,860
Does my crown
no longer count

469
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,250
Now that I have been imprisoned
for 1,000 years?

470
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,070
Did you not recall
the legend?

471
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,110
Did you not see
the signs?

472
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,580
I did,
and I know who you are.

473
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,990
You're the mare in the moon,
Nightmare Moon.

474
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,170
Well, well, well.

475
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,140
Somepony
who remembers me.

476
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,030
Then you also know
why I'm here.

477
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,510
You're here to...to...

478
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,710
Remember this day,
little ponies,

479
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,480
For it was your last.

480
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,370
From this moment forth,
the night will last forever!
