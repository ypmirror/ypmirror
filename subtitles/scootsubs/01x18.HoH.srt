00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,510
Well, mine's bigger!

361
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,060

Well, mine, is, um, heavier?

Can you believe it?
We won!

370
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,590
I knew our act
was awesome!

371
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,530
You know
what would be the best?

372
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,340
If we won
and we got our cutie marks.

374
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,290

thanks, Twilight.

Hey.
You don't sound too excited.

[ Sighs ]

379
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,350
We worked really hard
and won a prize,

380
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,820
But we still don't have
our cutie marks.

381
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,730
Which is the prize
we really wanted.

382
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,870
Oh, girls.

383
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,560
But we think
we know why.

We know why.

385
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,070
Oh?
Tell me.

386
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,820
I'd love to make a special
report to the princess.

387
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,850
Well, maybe we were trying
too hard.

388
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,710
Yes?
And?

389
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,630
And instead of forcing ourselves

390
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,710
To do something
that's not meant for us...

391
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,530
yes? Yes?

392
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,530
We each should be embracing
our true talent.

393
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,260
And that is?

394
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,450
