1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,380
Ptoo! Ptoo!

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,510
Not too fast, now,
Angel bunny.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,210
You don't want to get
a tummy ache.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,690
You really should eat more
than that, don't you think?

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,850
It's not playtime yet.

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,880
I know
you want to run,

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,220
But just
three more bites.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,300
Two more bites?

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,760
One more bite?

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,040
Pretty please?

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,570
Oh, goodness.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,770
Are you okay?

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,530
Are you coughing

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,510
Because there's a carrot
stuck in your throat?

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,030
Because you need
some water?

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,680
Because of that giant cloud
of scary, black smoke?

17
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,680
I'll take that as a...
yes.

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,330
Help! Help!

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,460
Please?

21
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,680
Help!

22
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,810
There's -- There's a horrible
cloud of smoke.

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,910
It's headed this way,
and -- Aah!

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,810
Don't be such
a scaredy-Pony.

25
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,410
It's just me, future Equestria
ball-Bouncing record holder.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,280
146, 147...

27
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,640
this calls
for a celebration!

28
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,300
Oh, no, Pinkie Pie.
This is no time for celebration.

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,200
This is a time for panic,
for --

30
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,400
Ooh!
I'm gonna need balloons!

31
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,620
One for every pony
in Ponyville.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,270
There's -- There's smoke,

33
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,750
And -- And where there's smoke,
there's fire, and --

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,720
Let's see!

35
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,850
That's
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

36
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,790
154, 155...
no, wait.

37
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,650
7...

38
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,230
Pinkie Pie!

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
Now I have to
start over.

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,360
We're all gonna have to
start over

41
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,410
In a new village,

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,190
'Cause ours
is gonna be --

43
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,800
Hey, Rainbow Dash,
wait up!

44
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,380
Oh, please.
This is an emergency.

45
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,020
I-I need every pony
to --

46
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,940
Listen up!

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,410
Smoke is spreading
over all of Equestria.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,600
What?!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,880
That's what i've
been trying to --

50
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,920
But don't worry.

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,350
I've just received a letter
from princess Celestia

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,530
Informing me that it is not
coming from a fire.

53
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,500
Oh, thank goodness.

54
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,320
It's coming from a dragon.

55
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,020
A...d-D-Dragon?

56
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,100
What in the name
of all things cinnamon swirl

57
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,480
Is a full-Grown dragon
doing here in Equestria?

58
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,150
Sleeping.

59
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,340
Huh?
Huh?Huh?
Huh?

60
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,240
According to princess Celestia,
he's taking a nap.

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,990
His snoring is what's causing
all this smoke.

62
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,820
He should really see
a doctor.

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,530
That doesn't sound healthy
at all.

64
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,630
Well, at least he's not
snoring fire.

65
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,730
What are we meant to do
about it?

66
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,600
I'll tell you
what we're meant to do --

67
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,700
Give him the boot!

68
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,590
Take that!

69
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,730
And that!

70
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,620
We need to encourage him
to take a nap somewhere else.

71
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,090
Princess Celestia
has given us this mission,

72
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,420
And we must not fail.

73
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,680
If we do, Equestria
will be covered in smoke

74
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,110
For the next 100 years.

75
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,530
Talk about getting
your beauty sleep.

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,450
All right, everypony, I need you
to gather supplies quickly.

77
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,170
We've got a long journey
ahead of us.

78
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,950
Let's meet back here
in less than an hour.

79
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,860
Okay, girls,
you heard her!

80
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,890
The fate of Equestria
is in our hooves.

81
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,200
Do we have
what it takes?!

82
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,010
Yeah!
You betcha!
We can do it!

83
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,900
Yeah, we can do it!

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,100
Um...actually...

85
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,650
rrarrr!

86
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,290
Hyah!

87
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,300
Oh, I mean...

88
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,770
grrr!

89
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,640
Ew!

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,040
Much better.

91
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,180
Onward!

92
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,430
Let's go!

93
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,940
Um...
let's...not?

94
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,320
All right, girls,
listen up.

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,150
I'm mapping out
the fastest route,

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,530
But we've all got to keep
a good pace

97
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,730
If we expect to make it up
the mountain by nightfall.

98
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,730
M-Mountain?

99
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,190
The dragon is in that cave
at the very top.

100
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,460
Looks pretty cold
up there.

101
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,050
You bet it is.

102
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,500
The higher you go,
the chillier it gets.

103
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,300
Good thing
I brought my scarf.

104
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,210
Ooh! Pretty!

105
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,730
Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,100
That'll keep you
nice and cozy.

107
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,880
Um, excuse me. Twilight?

108
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,430
I know you're busy,
but --

109
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,230
Uh-Huh.

110
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,930
Well,
we could go this way.

111
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,750
But if I could just have
a second --

112
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,400
Uh-Huh.
No, we want to avoid that.

113
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,320
So, um, i-I was thinking
that, um,

114
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,810
Maybe I should
just stay here in Ponyville.

115
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:43,960
Uh-Huh.

116
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,410
Oh, good!

117
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,810
I'll stay here and --

118
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,610
Wait!
You have to come.

119
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,340
Your way with wild animals
will surely come in handy.

120
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,380
I don't think I --

121
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,450
Oh, and don't worry
about your little
friends in the meadow.

122
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,210
Spike's got it covered
while you're gone.

123
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,590
You can count on me.

124
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,480
Ohh!

125
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,370
Hey! Hey!

126
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,350
Wait!

127
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,290
I don't really think
he's up to the task.

128
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,970
Maybe...

129
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,140
but...but...

130
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,000
Are you sure you want Fluttershy
to come along?

131
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,350
I mean, that pony's afraid
of her own shadow.

132
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,560
She's just gonna
slow us down.

133
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,170
Oh, she's just
a little nervous.

134
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,590
Once we get going,
I'm sure she'll be fine.

135
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,470
Oh!

136
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,740
All right, girls.

137
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,790
Move out.

138
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,140
But...but...

139
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,400
Whoa!
What was that?

140
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,250
That is what it sounds like
when a dragon snores.

141
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,090
It's -- It's so...

142
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,380
high.

143
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,510
Well,
it is a mountain.

144
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,710
I'm gonna fly up there
and check it out!

145
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,110
Hold on, now.

146
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,930
I think we should
all go up together.

147
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,560
Safety in numbers
and all.

148
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,100
Oh, all right.

149
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,450
I hear the only thing
that sparkles more
than a dragon's scales

150
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,990
Are the jewels they use
to build their nests.

151
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,840
Ooh!

152
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,250
If I play
my cards right,

153
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,640
I might be able to convince him
to part with a few.

154
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,190
"Welcome to my cave,
Rarity.

155
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,600
"Care for a diamond?

156
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,000
Rrarrr!"

157
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,530
Girls!
This is no laughing matter.

158
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,440
Fluttershy, you're the expert
on wild creatures.

159
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,510
What do you think the dragon
will be like?

160
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,780
Fluttershy?

161
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,340
Hey, what are you waiting for --
An invitation?

162
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,260
Ooh! I think I have one
in my bag.

163
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,040
I-It's so...so...

164
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
steep.

165
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,250
Well, it is a cliff.

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,490
You could just --
Oh, I don't know -- Fly up here.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,740
Come on, Fluttershy,
you can do it!

168
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,110
Flap those wings.

169
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,770
Uh...okay.

170
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,800
Ohh! Uhh!

171
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,390
We don't have time for this.

172
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,820
What are you doing?

173
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,530
I'll need this
if I'm gonna take her

174
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,630
Around the mountain
another way.

175
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,630
Ohh!

176
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,420
Around
the mountain?

177
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,040
That's gonna take
them forever.

178
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,230
Don't worry, twi.

179
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,790
We'll be there
lickety-Split.

180
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,070
Whoo-Hoo!
I win again!

181
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,780
That's 35 games in a row.

182
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,430
Best of 71?

183
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,820
We...made...it.

184
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,020
Told you it was gonna
take them forever.

185
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,840
Your turn,
Fluttershy.

186
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,840
But it's so wide.

187
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,150
Come on, Fluttershy.

188
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,170
We should be
much farther along by now.

189
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,410
You could just
leap on over.

190
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,050
I --

191
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,190
I don't know.

192
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,630
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

193
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,100
It's just
a hop, skip, and a jump!

194
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,490
See?

195
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,190
* it's not very far,
just move your little rump *

196
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,780
* you can make it if you try
with a hop, skip, and jump *

197
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,140
We don't have time
for this.

198
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,810
* a hop, skip, and a jump,
just move your little rump *

199
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,560
* a hop, skip, and jump,
a hop, skip, and jump *

200
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,130
* a hop, skip, and jump,
a hop, skip, and jump *

201
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,090
* a hop, skip, and jump

202
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,430
Okay.

203
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,820
Here I go.

204
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,120
A hop...

205
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,610
that's it.
You got it.
Almost there.

206
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,720
Skip...

207
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,650
just don't look down.

208
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,060
Aah!

209
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,580
I guess
I forgot to jump.

210
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,550
Let's keep it down.

211
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,750
According to my map,

212
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,220
We're entering
an avalanche zone.

213
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,940
The smallest peep
could cause a huge rockslide.

214
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,120
An --
An ava-- Ava--

215
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,680
Shh!

216
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,850
avala--

217
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,730
Avalanche!
Avalanche!
Avalanche!
Avalanche!

218
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,340
Oh, no!

219
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,430
Help! Oh!

220
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,270
Oh, my.

221
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,950
Everypony okay?

222
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,090
Thanks to you,
I am.

223
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,760
Ugh! Blech!

224
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,900
Whoo-Hoo!
Let's do it again!

225
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,560
This is why a girl
always packs extra accessories.

226
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,740
Oh, please tell me I brought
the tiara that goes with this.

227
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,020
Uh, I think we got
bigger problems

228
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,830
Than making sure our hair bows
match our horseshoes.

229
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,770
Sorry.

230
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,580
Ah, no big whoop,
sugar cube.

231
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,410
Yeah.

232
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,280
We'll just have to climb over.

233
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,410
Aah!

234
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,270
Aah!

235
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,200
My apologies.

236
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,180
Not your fault.

237
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,760
Still think it was a good idea
to bring Fluttershy along?

238
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,680
We're about to
find out.

239
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,180
We're here.

240
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,660
Rainbow Dash, you'll use
your wings to clear the smoke.

241
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,450
Mm-Hmm.

242
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,990
Rarity and Pinkie Pie,

243
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,960
You create a diversion
to distract the dragon

244
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,510
If things get a little hairy
in there.

245
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,310
Applejack,
you're ready with the apples

246
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,750
In case he decides
to attack.

247
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,930
But it shouldn't come to that
because Fluttershy

248
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,610
Will do what she needs to do
to wake him up.

249
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,750
And between the two of us,
we should be able

250
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,700
To get him to understand
why he needs to go.

251
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,030
Is everypony ready?

252
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,550
Mm-Hmm!
Mm-Hmm!
Mm-Hmm!
Mm-Hmm!

253
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,720
Okay, then.
We're going in.

254
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,730
So...

255
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,510
what is the best way
to wake up a sleeping dragon

256
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,010
Without upsetting him?

257
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,340
Fluttershy?

258
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,700
Oh, come on.

259
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,710
Come on!

260
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,060
We have to do this.

261
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,750
Now!

262
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,140
Every second longer

263
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
That dragon sleeps

264
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,350
Is another acre of Equestria

265
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,690
That is covered in smoke.

266
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,280
I...i...

267
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,560
I can't go in the cave.

268
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,410
Oh, great!

269
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,430
She's scared
of caves now, too.

270
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,210
I'm not scared
of caves.

271
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,840
I'm scared of dr...

272
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,620
what's that,
sugar cube?

273
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,890
I'm scared of drag...

274
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,170
what?

275
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,610
I'm scared of dragons!

276
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,780
But, Fluttershy,
you have a wonderful talent

277
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,870
Dealing with all kinds
of animals.

278
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,890
Yes, because
they're not dragons.

279
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,180
Oh, come on!

280
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,750
We've seen you walk right up
to a horrible manticore

281
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,850
Like it was nothing.

282
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,640
Yes,
because he wasn't a dragon.

283
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,320
Spike is a dragon.
You're not scared of him.

284
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,130
Yes, because he's not a huge,
gigantic, terrifying, enormous,

285
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,620
Teeth-Gnashing,
shark-Scale-Having,

286
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,840
Horn-Wearing,
smoke-Snoring,

287
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,070
Could-Eat-A-Pony-In-One-Bite,

288
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,610
Totally all-Grown-Up dragon.

289
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,570
But if you're
so afraid of dragons,

290
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,920
Why didn't you
say something

291
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,720
Before we came
all the way up here?

292
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,640
I was afraid to.

293
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,880
Argh!

294
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,570
All of us are scared
of that dragon.

295
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
I'm not!

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,110
Almost all of us
are scared of that dragon,

297
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,020
But we've got a job
to do.

298
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,790
So get in there
with Twilight

299
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,090
And show her
what you're made of.

300
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,490
I...i...

301
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,770
I just...

302
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,470
can't.

303
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,780
Oh, Fluttershy.

304
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,820
I'm going in.

305
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,800
He probably just doesn't realize
what he's doing...

306
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,090
right?

307
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,290
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Easy-Peasy.
Of course.

308
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,850
If you say so.

309
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,060
Mr. Dragon?

310
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,330
Uh, excuse me?

311
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,350
Mr. Dragon?

312
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, good.
You're awake.

313
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,200
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

314
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,420
My name is Twilight...

315
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,330
Ohh!

316
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,520
...Sparkle,
and my friends and i

317
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,500
Are residents here
in Equestria.

318
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,430
Ponyville,
to be exact.

319
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,580
We've come here to ask

320
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,740
That you find another spot
to take your nap.

321
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,200
It's just that you seem to be
doing an awful lot of snoring,

322
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,560
And every time you do,

323
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,130
You send out a terrible cloud
of smoke.

324
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,690
Equestria simply can't survive
100 years in a dark haze.

325
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,040
You understand,
don't you?

326
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,820
So, you'll find
another place to sleep?

327
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,420
So much for persuading him.

328
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,710
Now what?

329
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,600
Obviously,
this situation

330
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,020
Just calls for a little
pony charm.

331
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,070
Allow me, girls.

332
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,950
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

333
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,890
Uh, but I couldn't possibly
head back home

334
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,930
Without mentioning
what handsome scales you have.

335
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,290
And those scales
have to be hidden away

336
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,960
In some silly cave
for 100 years?

337
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,890
Personally, I think you should
skip the snoozing

338
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,860
And be out there,
showing them off.

339
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,750
Obviously,
I would be more than happy

340
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,570
To keep an eye on your jewels
while you're gone.

341
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,640
Aah!

342
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,310
I was this close
to getting that diamond.

343
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,970
You mean,
"getting rid of that dragon"?

344
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,140
Oh, yeah, sure.

345
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,730
What in tarnation?

346
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,240
Darling,
you look ridiculous.

347
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,400
Exactly!

348
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,760
Sharing a laugh is a surefire
way to get someone on your side.

349
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,600
Hi!

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,840
Apparently he doesn't like laughing

351
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,130
Or sharing.

352
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,610
All right!
That's it!

353
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,090
We've tried persuasion,
charm,

354
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,230
Whatever it is
Pinkie Pie does.

355
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,950
It's time to stop wasting time!
I'm going in!

356
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,520
Rainbow, no!

357
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,200
Get out!

358
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,670
Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Choo!

359
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,010
I'm...sorry.

360
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,650
Wh-O-O-O-Oa!

361
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,280
Aah!
Whoa!

362
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,870
How dare you?

363
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,160
How dare you!

364
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,290
Listen here, mister!

365
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,650
Just because you're big

366
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,940
Doesn't mean you get to be
a bully!

367
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,080
You may have huge teeth
and sharp scales

368
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,010
And snore smoke
and breathe fire,

369
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,640
But you do not --

370
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,030
I repeat --
You do not hurt my friends!!

371
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,500
You got that?

372
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,210
Well?

373
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,660
But that Rainbow one
kicked me.

374
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,900
And I am very sorry
about that.

375
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,880
But you're bigger than she is,
and you should know better.

376
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,200
You should also know better
than to take a nap

377
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,090
Where your snoring can become
a health hazard

378
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,620
To other creatures.

379
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,280
But I --

380
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,710
Don't you "but i" me,
mister.

381
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,150
Now, what do you have to say
for yourself?

382
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,950
I said, what do you have to say
for yourself?

383
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,810
There, there.
No need to cry.

384
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,470
You're not
a bad dragon.

385
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,450
You just made
a bad decision.

386
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,090
Now,
go pack your things.

387
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,450
You just need to find
a new place to sleep.

388
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,250
That's all.

389
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,710
Fluttershy
to the rescue!

390
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,320
You did it.
I knew you could do it.

391
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,690
I said, come back here!

392
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,850
Ohh!

393
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,180
How does Fluttershy put up
with you furry, little things?

394
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,250
Spike?

395
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,870
Take a letter.

396
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,710
with pleasure.

397
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,600
"Dear princess Celestia,
I am happy to report

398
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,700
"That the dragon has departed
our fair country

399
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,950
"And that it was
my good friend Fluttershy

400
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,190
"Who convinced him to go.

401
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,640
"This adventure
has taught me

402
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,600
"To never lose faith
in your friends.

403
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,830
"They can be
an amazing source of strength

404
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,980
"And can help you overcome
even your greatest fears.

405
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,320
Always your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle."

406
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,780
Twilight,
you got to come see this!

407
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,010
She's just five away
from a new pony record.

408
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,420
347, 348...

409
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,050
rrarrr!
Dragon!

410
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,210
Why are you laughing?
That awful dragon is back!

411
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,170
Rrarrr!

412
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,370
Pinkie Pie,
you scared me!

413
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,280
I mean, uh...

414
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,350
you broke
my concentration.

415
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,240
It's okay,
Rainbow Dash.

416
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,110
Not eve pony
can be as brave as me.

417
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,660
Aah!
