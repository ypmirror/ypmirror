1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,200
So sorry, Fluttershy.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,950
I hate being late
for our weekly get-together.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,950
The usual.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,750
But you would not believe
what happened to me!

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,580
Is everything
all right?

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,750
Oh, it's much more
than all right.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,960
I was on my way here
wearing my latest hat creation,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,090
when who should stop me
on the street but Photo Finish!

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,140
Photo Finish?

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,760
She's the most famous
fashion photographer

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,890
in all of Equestria!

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,020
Anyhoo, she saw my hat

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,650
and said it was
"absolutely marvelous!"

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,900
What a lovely compliment.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,990
She was so impressed

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,900
that she wants to take
some pictures at my shop,

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,780
featuring
some of my clothes!

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,830
That's wonderful.

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you know
what this could mean

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,870
for my fashion career?

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,960
Oh, Rarity,
I'm so happy for you.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,750
But I'm going to need somepony
fabulous to model for me.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,590
Somepony with beauty,

24
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,170
somepony with grace,

25
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,630
somepony...

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,010
like you?

27
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,220
Oh, goodness.
I don't know.

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,060
Oh, this is
such a huge opportunity,

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,730
and it would mean
so much to me.

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,650
I'm flattered, really.

31
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,320
Nopony is going to have
your elegance and poise.

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,900
But --
Nopony.

33
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,110
There has to be somepony
more qualif--
Please?!

34
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,900
Somepony
more into fashion.
Please?!

35
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,990
Somepony more comfortable
in the spotlight.

36
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,330
Please, please,
ple-e-e-ase?!

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,040
Oh, if it's that important
to you, of course I'll do it.

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,920
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,290
You are the best friend
a pony could ever have!

40
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,670
What a wonderful way
to spend an afternoon.

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,880
Isn't it?

42
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,720
Though, I was so afraid you
wouldn't agree to model for me

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,220
that I felt
completely frazzled!

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,930
I think I feel a pimple
coming on.

45
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,060
Oh!
Only one solution.

46
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,100
The usual.

47
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,770
* My Little Pony

48
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,610
* My Little Pony

49

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,610
* My Little Pony

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,950
* I used to wonder
What friendship could be *

52
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,700
* My Little Pony

53
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,290
* Until you all shared
Its magic with me *

54
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,330
* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

55
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,670
* A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong *

56
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,130
* Sharing kindness
* It's an easy feat

57
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,420
* And magic
Makes it all complete *

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,960
* Yeah, My Little Pony

59
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:35,010
* Do you know you're all
My very best friends? *

60
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,690
Hmm. She's going to want to see
attitude and pizzazz.

61
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,690
A-a-attitude and...
pizzazz.

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,320
More light! It has to catch
the sequins just so

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,610
or the whole outfit
is just a disaster.

64
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,320
Ooh, and the headdress
needs more feathers.

65
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,910
Pinkie Pie,
more feathers!

66
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,920
And sequins!
More sequins!

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,800
And more ribbon!

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Oh, no. Less ribbon.

69
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,430
No! More ribbon.

70
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,350
Oh, this hem
is completely off.

71
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,350
Pin cushion!

72
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,820
Thank you all
for helping me.

73
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,780
I'm sorry to be so short with
you, but I'm just so nervous.

74
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,990
Ooh,
doesn't that hurt?

75
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,040
Thick scales.
Can't feel a thing.

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,870
And even if I could,

77
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,880
there is no pain that would
keep me from assisting...

78
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,380
the most beautiful creature
in the world.

79
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,260
Ugh!

80
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm gonna tell you two
a secret,

81
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,880
but you have to promise
not to tell anyone.

82
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,890
I promise.

83
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,470
Cross my heart
and hope to fly.

84
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,020
Stick a cupcake
in my eye.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,570
I have a crush
on Rarity.

86
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,820
We won't say a word.

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,610
Give me a break.

88
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,570
Everypony already knows
how you --

89
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,910
Twilight! You promised Spike
you wouldn't say anything.

90
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,290
He trusts you,
and losing a friend's trust

91
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,980
is the fastest way
to lose a friend forever!

92
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:22,750
But --

93
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,070
Foreve-e-e-r!

94
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,540
My lips are sealed.

95
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,750
Though I'm pretty sure

96
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,340
Rarity is gonna pick up
on your feelings.

97
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,510
I, Photo Finish...

98
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,890
have awwived.

99
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,600
Let me just say,
what an honor.

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,770
We begin...

101
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
...now.

102
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,940
Attitude and pizzazz!

103
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,610
Yes! Show Photo Finish
something!

104
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,620
No!

105
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,830
Yes.

106
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,960
No!

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,790
Yes.

108
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,550
No!

109
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,630
Yes.

110
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,470
Enough!

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,390
She hardly took
any pictures.

112
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,770
I'm so sorry.
I tried my best.

113
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,650
Well, the headdress
is too big for you,

114
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,990
and the cape
had too much sparkle.

115
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,360
I can't believe I ever thought
I could impress her.

116
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,160
It seems that I,
Photo Finish,

117
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,080
have found the next fashion star
here in Ponyville.

118
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,500
Really?

119
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,790
Yes, really.

120
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,830
And I, Photo Finish,

121
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,670
am going to help her to shine
all over Eqvestria!

122
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,970
Tomorrow,
a photo shoot in ze park!

123
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,970
I go!

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,680
Did you hear that?

125
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,060
I am going to
"shine all over Equestria!"

126
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,650
Oh, Rarity, I was so worried
I'd ruined everything.

127
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,570
Oh, never.
I knew you'd be perfect.

128
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,830
No. No. No.

129
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,960
Yes!

130
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,750
That is definitely
the one.

131
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,760
Photo Finish
is going to love it.

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,170
Everypony
is going to love it!

133
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,090
Oh, I am so excited
for you.

134
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,510
Just don't forget
us little ponies

135
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,060
when you become the most famous
designer in all of Equestria.

136
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,060
Never.

137
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,770
Put me down here.

138
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,070
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no. No.

139
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,070
The model should be
in something simple!

140
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,700
Something inspired by...

141
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,160
the nature.

142
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,040
That's just
what I was thinking.

143
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,580
Um, give me a moment
and I'll, uh,

144
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,040
put a little something
together.

145
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,460
Yes. That will not
be necessary.

146
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,550
But -- But --

147
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,880
How are you going to help me
"shine across Equestria"

148
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,010
If I don't design something new
for these pictures?

149
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,890
I am not going to help you
shine across Equestria!

150
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,890
I am going to help
her shine.

151
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,140
She is my star!

152
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,770
You, go.

153
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,240
I can't, Rarity.

154
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,280
Oh, but you must,
Fluttershy.

155
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,830
Photo Finish
wants to make you a star.

156
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,250
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

157
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,250
I know we were both hoping
it would be my lifetime,

158
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,080
but nonetheless, you can't
throw away this chance.

159
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,710
You must do this
for me.

160
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,380
You must.
You must! You mus-s-t!

161
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,090
Floottershy!

162
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,220
It is time to make...

163
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,220
the magics!

164
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,730
Oh, wunderbar!

165
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,390
You are like
a delicate flower --

166
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,690
So much more alluring without
all those sparkles and feathers.

167
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,110
How'd it go?!
How'd it go?!

168
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,370
It didn't.

169
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,910
Photo Finish wanted to work
with Fluttershy, not me.

170
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh, Rarity.
I'm so sorry.

171
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,290
Is there anything
we can do?

172
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,170
I just...vant to be alone
right now.

173
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,010
You heard her.
She "vants to be alone."

174
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,680
What? I didn't think
she meant alone alone.

175
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,990
Too much blush.

176
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,030
Not enough.

177
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,160
Too much.

178
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,740
Not enough.

179
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,210
Perfect.

180
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,920
Ah-ahhhhhh...

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,920
choo!

182
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,920
Oh, yes!

183
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,920
Even her schneezes
are graceful!

184
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,050
Now go!

185
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,930
How do you feel?
Excited? Overjoyed?

186
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,310
Thrilled beyond
your wildest dreams?

187
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,350
N-nervous.

188
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,020
Nervous?
Don't be ridiculous!

189
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,150
You're only facing
a large crowd of ponies

190
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,190
who will be watching your every
move and silently judging you.

191
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,480
Your cue! Now go!

192
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,500
I can't let Rarity down.
I must do this.

193
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,830
Must, must, must.

194
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,430
So graceful.

195
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,930
So lovely.

196
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,890
So perfect for my
new advertisement.

197
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
It's Fluttershy!

198
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,010
Fluttershy!
Fluttershy!

199
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,350
Over here!

200
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,140
Fluttershy!
Over here!

201
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,940
Beautiful, thank you.
Thank you.

202
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
Come here!

203
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,940
Right here, Fluttershy!
Over here!

204
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,940
Fluttershy!
There you are.

205
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,530
Hey, over here, Fluttershy!
Look over here!

206
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Fluttershy!
More pictures,
please.

207
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Wow.
Look how popular you are.

208
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,130
I'm so excited for you.

209
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,840
You must be
having the best time ever.

210
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,430
Oh, yes.
Best time ever.

211
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,840
Floottershy!

212
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,050
I have been looking for you
everywhere.

213
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,970
We have the thing
at the place!

214
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,310
I'll see you at the spa,
our usual time?

215
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,140
Of course!

216
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,600
I can't wait to hear
all about the...

217
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,360
thing at the place.

218
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,650
I'm the one who should be mobbed
by strangers wherever I go.

219
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,330
Welcome
to carousel boutique!

220
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,330
Is she still here?
We heard Fluttershy was here.

221
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,210
Sorry.
You just missed her.

222
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,080
But you're
still in luck.

223
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,170
I'm having a huge sale
on some of my best designs.

224
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,880
And you are?

225
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,470
Rarity, of course.

226
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,340
Never heard of you.

227
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,640
Obviously, I, Photo Finish,
am thrilled to have found her.

228
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,600
Photo Finish?

229
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,270
She's a natural
in front of the camera.

230
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,070
Um, Photo Finish?

231
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,990
I only need
to point and shoot,

232
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,030
and I capture...

233
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,030
the magics!

234
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,370
Photo Finish,
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

235
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,330
It's just
that I'm running late.

236
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,450
How could I have forgotten?!

237
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,670
Your appearance
at the ballet opening --

238
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,960
Everypony who is anypony
will be there!

239
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,090
Oh, actually, I'm supposed to be
meeting my friend --

240
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,130
We go!

241
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,220
My hooves are getting
positively prune-y,

242
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,180
I've been waiting here
so long.

243
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,690
Obviously, Fluttershy's just
too busy with her new career

244
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,060
to spend time
with her best friend.

245
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,270
I'm sure
she just got tied up.

246
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,480
Of course she did.

247
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,690
She's a big, bright,
shining star.

248
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,490
I wish
that star would burn out!

249
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,370
Rarity, Fluttershy
is your friend.

250
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,410
I know! I know!

251
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,540
And I should be
happy for her,

252
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,580
but instead,
I'm just...unh...jealous!

253
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,420
Oh, please promise you won't
tell her I feel this way!

254
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,290
Please? Please?
Please, please, ple-e-ase?

255
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,590
You have my word.

256
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,410
Losing a friend's trust is the
fastest way to lose a friend.

257
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,190
Forever!

258
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,350
Wow!
You look great!

259
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,600
Fluttershy may be
the one who's famous,

260
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,650
but that doesn't mean I have to
stop looking fabulous.

261
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,070
Rarity,
I'm so sorry I'm --

262
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,990
Oh, no.
She's already gone, isn't she?

263
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,330
Sorry.

264
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,330
Oh, I can't believe this.

265
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,500
I am so frustrated,
I could just scream.

266
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,750
Aaaah...

267
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,750
Feel better?

268
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,050
No.

269
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,090
Can I tell you
something?

270
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,880
Of course.

271
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,510
You promise
not to tell Rarity?

272
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,600
I swear.

273
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,140
Pinkie Pie swear?

274
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,770
Cross my heart
and hope to fly.

275
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,640
Stick a cupcake
in my --

276
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,310
I don't like
being a model.

277
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,150
No, I hate
being a model.

278
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,320
All this attention is awful,
just awful!

279
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,280
And I'm only doing it

280
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,180
because Rarity told me
I must, I must, I must.

281
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,320
I must.

282
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,140
Oh, really?

283
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,160
Well...

284
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,580
if you want to know
the truth, Rarity --

285
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,800
W-what were you
about to say?

286
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,380
Forever!

287
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,760
Nothing.

288
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,060
I was just thinking --

289
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,310
If you really don't like being
a model, you could always quit.

290
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,730
Oh, no. I could never
do such a thing.

291
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,610
Rarity
would be devastated.

292
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,150
But Rarity told me --

293
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,500
Mmm! Juicy!

294
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,880
Oh, if only all these ponies
didn't like me so much,

295
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,960
Photo Finish wouldn't
want me to model anymore.

296
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,880
She'd find
somepony else with...

297
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,430
the magic.

298
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,760
I guess you're right.

299
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,100
You're right.

300
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,680
You're right! You're right!
You're right!

301
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
It's Fluttershy!

302
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,190
Don't you see?

303
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,650
On her own, Fluttershy could
never do something unattractive.

304
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,400
But if I use my magic
to help her

305
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,780
do something unattractive
at her next fashion show,

306
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
no one will ever
want her to model again.

307
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,030
And if Fluttershy
no longer has to be a model,

308
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,580
Rarity will no longer
have to be jealous of her.

309
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,830
And I'll no longer
have to keep their secrets!

310
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,540
It's the perfect plan!
You can't tell anyone about it.

311
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,920
Promise me
you won't tell anyone?!

312
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,850
So, you do promise
or you don't?

313
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,890
Uh, yes!

314
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,480
Obviously, that's why
I zipped my mouth closed,

315
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,640
then locked it with a key,

316
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,560
then dug a hole,
then buried the key,

317
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,230
then built a house on top of the
hole where I buried the key,

318
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,530
then moved into the house
on top of the hole!

319
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,490
Obviously.

320
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,500
You really think
it'll work?

321
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,120
They love you
for being you,

322
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,750
so all I have to do
is make you not be you.

323
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,960
Just leave it to me.

324
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,970
I guess it's time to see
what all the fuss is about.

325
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,530
Uhhh...

326
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,280
Aah!

327
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,540
Aah!

328
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,180
Oh, no.

329
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,730
Get her off the stage!

330
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,690
She's an embarrassment
to all things fashion!

331
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,690
I, Photo Finish,
have made a terrible mistake!

332
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,820
Bravo! I say, bravo!

333
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,860
Bravo?!

334
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,660
Who could possibly say bravo
to that horrid display?

335
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,250
Such attitude!
Such pizzazz!

336
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,870
She's invented an entirely
new kind of modeling!

337
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,170
Who is saying
these things?

338
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,840
It's her!

339
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,840
The unicorn in the gorgeous cape
and headdress.

340
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,170
Now, that is a pony
who clearly knows

341
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,220
a thing or two
about fashion.

342
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,310
Well, if that fabulous pony
likes it, then I do, too!

343
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,310
Bravo!

344
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,310
Yes!

345
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,070
This is awful.
Just awful.

346
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,740
Somehow I've become
more popular than ever.

347
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,370
Oh, I'm just so frustrated,
I could just kick something!

348
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,710
If only Rarity didn't want me
to be a model so badly.

349
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,710
But Rarity --

350
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,340
Fluttershy!
Are you all right?

351
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,130
I'm great.

352
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,890
I'm a super-famous
fashion model.

353
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,890
Why wouldn't I
be great?

354
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,180
Because you ha--

355
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,890
Out there
on the runway,

356
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,190
everyone was
turning on you, and --

357
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,270
Oh, Fluttershy,
it's so awful.

358
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,070
I wanted them to.

359
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,610
You did?!

360
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,700
Of course she did!
Because --

361
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,190
I'm jealous!

362
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,950
I wanted
all the attention,

363
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,660
and instead,
it was going to you.

364
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
I even started hoping that
you would do something silly

365
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,660
so your modeling career
would be over.

366
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,430
But then,
when it started happening,

367
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,840
all I could think was,

368
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,440
"how could I
want you to fail

369
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,410
at something
you love so much?"

370
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,340
But Fluttershy
doesn't --

371
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,140
Love?

372
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,970
Oh, Rarity,
I hate being a model.

373
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,970
You do?

374
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,220
More than anything.

375
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,350
Then why
did you keep doing it?

376
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,980
I was afraid if I quit,
you'd be mad at me

377
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,810
for not wanting to
"shine all over Equestria."

378
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,110
And I thought
if I told you

379
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,860
how jealous I was
of your success,

380
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,650
you'd think
I was a terrible friend.

381
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,650
Never.

382
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,780
All this time.

383
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,410
If we just told each other
the truth.

384
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,740
I promise never to keep
my feelings a secret again.

385
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,620
Me too.

386
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,480
Cross my heart and hope to fly.

387
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,150
Stick a cupcake in my eye.

388
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,960
You were bwilliant!
Bwilliant!

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,090
I've already got
six photo shoots

390
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,960
lined up
for tomorrow alone.

391
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,380
I'm sorry, Photo Finish,

392
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,760
but I don't think I'll be able
to make any of them.

393
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,180
Wha-a-t?

394
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,430
We go!
We go!

395
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,810
Vhat has just happened?

396
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,980
Spike has a crush
on Rarity!

397
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,150
And you were doing so well.

398
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,450
Now, this is a wonderful way
to spend an afternoon.

399
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,120
Isn't it, though?

400
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,870
Dear Princess Celestia,

401
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,870
Being a good friend means
being able to keep a secret,

402
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,370
but you should never be afraid

403
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,080
to share your true feelings
with a good friend.

404
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,880
Did you get all that,
Spike?

405
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,000
No, I did not.

406
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,500
I still can't believe
you told someone

407
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,220
about my secret feelings
for Rarity!

408
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,510
You're right.

409
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,220
That was wrong of me,
and I'm very sorry.

410
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,010
Apology accepted.

411
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,020
Now will you take down
my letter to Princess Celestia?

412
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,890
I would love to,

413
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,850
but I'm a little busy
at the moment.

414
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,820
* My Little Pony

415
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,950
* My Little Pony

416
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
* My Little Pony

417
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,050
* Friends
