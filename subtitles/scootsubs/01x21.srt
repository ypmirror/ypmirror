1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,870
"And that's when the yellow
birdie thought to himself,

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,750
"'Hmm.
My favorite little tree

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,800
"isn't such
a little tree anymore.'

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,260
"So she sang her song
big and strong,

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,130
"and they all lived
in that great, big tree

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,550
"happily ever after.

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,510
The end."

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,970
Applejack!

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,140
Were you reading
a bedtime story to...

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,100
an apple tree?

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,400
Uh...

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,940
Well, you know, being replanted
in a whole new place

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,940
is very upsetting
for a tree.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,030
And Bloomberg here
is one of my favorites.

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,820
No fair, Applejack!

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,330
You've got a luxurious private
sleeper car for a tree,

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,790
while I am crowded and cramped
in the same car

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,160
with all the other ponies.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,630
How am I supposed to get
my beauty sleep?!

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,340
But Bloomberg's the whole reason
we're making this trip.

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,840
He needs his rest
so we can give him as a gift

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,220
to my relatives
in Appleloosa.

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,340
Hmm!

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,050
You talk about it as if
it's your baby or something.

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,140
Who you calling a baby?
Bloomberg's no baby!

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,100
Don't let widdle Rarity
make you all saddy-waddy.

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,690
Bloomberg's
a big and strong apple tree.

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,850
Yes, he is.

29
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,940
A-coochie-coochie,
coo-coo-coo!

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,030
It's widdle Rarity
who's all saddy-waddy!

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,570
Ugh!

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,330

Its magic with me *

Oh, man!
We're going fast!

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,580
Oh, my gosh!
This is so exciting!
I can't even wait!

46
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,500
For crying out loud
in the morning!

47
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,370
I can't wait!
Yeah!

48
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,580
Do you guys mind?

49
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,580
I was up early

50
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,380
fire-roasting those snacks
you're all eating,

51
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,460
and i'm pooped!

52
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
Uh, speaking of --

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,960
Some of these popcorn kernels
didn't get popped.

54
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,010
Okay, fine.

55
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,010
Good night!

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,640
Uh...

57
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,560
Maybe it's time we all got
a little shut-eye.

58
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,150
We've got a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

59
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,110
Aww!
Aww!
Aww!
Aww!

60
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,780
Psst!
Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?

61
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,660
No. Are you asleep yet?

62
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,950
If I was sleeping,

63
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,660
how could I have asked you
if you were asleep?

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,120
Oh, yeah.

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
When we get to Appleloosa,

66
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,670
you think we'll have to carry
that heavy tree

67
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,710
all the way from the train
to the orchard?

68
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,010
What tree?
You mean Bloomberg?

69
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,380
No. Fluttershy.

70
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,720
Fluttershy's not a tree,
silly!

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,630
What's going on?

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,890
Rainbow Dash
thinks Fluttershy's a tree.

73
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,180
I do not think she's a tree.
I was just --

74
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,180
Did you say
she was a tree?
No!

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,930
Well, yes,
but not exactly.

76
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,980
You know she's not a tree,
right?

77
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,060
She's not a tree,
Dashie.

78
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,570
I'd like to be a tree.

79
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,190
Oh, for Pete's sake!

80
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,490
Well,
that was kind of huffy.

81
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,700
Huffy the magic dragon.

82
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,870
Would you all
be quiet now?!

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,080
Aaah!
Aaah!Aaah!
Aaah!

84
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,130
Bloomberg?

85
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,470
Bloomberg?

86
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,180
Sorry, but I tend to snore
a bit.

87
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,720
Good night.

88
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,730
Huh?
Who gets what now?
Huh?

89
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,490
A buffalo stampede!

90
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,570
Oh, wow!

91
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,580
So noble,
all of them together.

92
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,990
I just love their accessories.

93
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,210
They're getting awfully close
to the train.

94
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,920
Aah!
Aah!Aah!
Aah!

95
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,070
Ooh! Looky!
Now they're doing tricks!

96
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,200
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Now do a back flip!

97
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,620
Or just jump?

98
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,960
Hmm.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,920
Something tells me
this isn't a circus act.

100
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,670
Hey, there!

101
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,800
Where you headed
in such a hurry?

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,180
Wow.

103
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,680
You're pretty quick
for someone so...bulky.

104
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,560
No offense.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,690
Huh?

106
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,480
I just want to know --

107
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,190
Hey!

108
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,990
I'm talking to you!

109
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,160
Whoa!

110
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,250
I've got you now, you --

111
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,730
They've got Bloomberg!

112
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,060
He-e-e-e-lp!

113
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,770
And Spike!

114
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,200
He-e-e-e-lp!

115
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,030
Dragon-napping Spike.
I'll show her!

116
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,080
Ow.

117
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,670
Hey, there!

118
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,670
Welcome to A-A-Appleloosa!

119
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,880
Braeburn, listen --

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,090
Cousin Applejack,
mind your manners.

121
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,550
You have yet to introduce me
to your compadres.

122
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,590
Shame on you!

123
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,970
Braeburn, listen!
Something terrible's happened!

124
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,810
"Terrible" is right.

125
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,890
Your train is a full
seven minutes late.

126
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,020
That's seven minutes less
for you to delight

127
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,610
in the pleasures and wonders
of A-A-Appleloosa!

128
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,110
Boggles the mind we
settler ponies built all this

129
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,030
in just the past year,
don't it?

130
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,030
And as you can see, we have
all of the finest comforts.

131
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,660
Like horse-drawn
carriages.

132
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Okay.
You pull now.

133
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,410
Aw, we just switched.

134
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,040
And those there are horse-drawn
horse-drawn carriages.

135
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,590
Listen, Braeburn,
I -- Oof!

136
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,130
And here's our local
watering hole, the salt block.

137
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,720
That's enough salt for you!

138
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,890
Can't I at least get
a glass of water?

139
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,440
Over there's the office
of Sheriff Silverstar.

140
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,520
And here's where we have
our wild west dances.

141
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,030
And here's where we have
our mi-west dances.

142
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,780
But, Braeburn, we --

143
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,860
And here's
the most wonderful sight

144
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,950
in all of A-A-Appleloosa --

145
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,700
Our apple orchard.

146
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,040
Braeburn!
First harvest
should be any day now.

147
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,000
Braebur--
Good thing, too.

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Brae--
'Cause we need
that grub to live on.

149
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,170
Braeburn!!

150
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,040
Uh, yes, cuz?

151
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,840
You have a very nice town
and all,

152
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,010
but we have
a huge problem!

153
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,880
Some of our friends
are missing.

154
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,180
A stampede of buffalo.

155
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,430
They took Spike!

156
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,720
Rainbow Dash
went after them!

157
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,180
And we can't find
Pinkie Pie.

158
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,890
And we had an apple tree with us
for your orchard,

159
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,100
but they took that, too!

160
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,190
Did you say buffalo?

161
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,440
Them buffalo,
they want us settler ponies

162
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,110
To take every single tree
you see here off this land.

163
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,910
They sure as hay don't want
any new ones added in.

164
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,950
But why?
Beats me.

165
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,080
We put a lot of hard work
into this land

166
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,000
so we could feed our town,
our families, our foals,

167
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,580
and now they're saying
all these trees have to go?

168
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,830
T'ain't fair.

169
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,560
Oh, I can't wait to get my
hooves on that little buffalo.

170
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Ow!

171
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,730
Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash
and gets away with it.

172
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,480
Boo!
Yah!

173
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,190
Pinkie Pie!

174
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,400
Oh, you caught me.

175
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,690
Looks like I tricked you and
didn't get away with it, either.

176
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,570
You're good.
Shh!

177
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,950
What do you think
you're doing?!

178
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,280
You got to
get out of here!

179
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,490
I do?

180
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,030
You're gonna blow
my cover!

181
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,120
I am?

182
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,120
I'm trying
to save Spike!

183
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,790
Oh, my gosh!
So am i!

184
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,500
And the more of us
there are out here,

185
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,830
The more chances
of us getting...

186
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,710
...caught.

187
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,880
Run, Pinkie! I'll hold them off!
Save yourself!

188
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,630
Stop!

189
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,800
Dash, Pinkie, 'sup?

190
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,720
Hey, no worries.
I know those guys.

191
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,970
They're cool.

192
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,810
If you say so, Spike.
Catch you later, bro.

193
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,610
Seems they took me
by mistake,

194
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,950
and they feel awful
about it, too, poor guys.

195
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,160
Fortunately,
they totally respect dragons,

196
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,620
so they treat me
like an honored guest.

197
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,160
Still don't like ponies much,
though,

198
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
Ugh!
but you're with me,
so it's cool.

199
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,210
Well, I still don't trust them.

200
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,000
I say we turn tail
and bail while we still --

201
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,880
Mmm!

202
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,510
Before we finish eating?
Are you loco in the coco?

203
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,760
Can I please have more
of that mushy stuff,
whatever it was?

204
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,640
Certainly.

205
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,310
And, Mr. Spike,
you like gemstones, yes?

206
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,640
Turquoise! Mmm!

207
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,770
This here's
Little Strongheart,

208
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,270
and these are my friends
Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.

209
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,030
You!

210
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,860
That's it!
We are out of here!

211
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,110
Ooh!

212
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,910
Wait!

213
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,040
Please accept my apologies
for what happened on the train.

214
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,160
We didn't mean
for anyone to be hurt.

215
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,040
Yeah, right.

216
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,000
We only wanted
the tree.

217
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,290
The settler ponies
have overtaken the land

218
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,710
and have planted an orchard
all over it.

219
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,720
Because of
their thoughtlessness,

220
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,800
we can no longer run over our
traditional stampeding grounds.

221
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Huh?
Huh?

222
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,720
I think it's time
they met Chief Thunderhooves.

223
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,060
We have a long and winding
stampeding trail

224
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,070
that we have run upon
for many generations.

225
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,190
My father stampeded
upon these grounds

226
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,240
and his father before him

227
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,370
and his father before him

228
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,830
and his father before him

229
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,210
and his father before him
and --

230
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,920
I think they get the idea,
Chief.

231
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,090
Hmph.

232
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,260
It is a sacred tradition
to run the path every year,

233
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,260
but this year,
these settler ponies,

234
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,890
these...

235
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,390
...Appleloosians...

236
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,350
they planted apple trees
all over it

237
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,270
without asking
our permission.

238
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,270
Well,
that's not very nice.

239
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,360
Right,
Rainbow Dash?
Hmph.

240
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,820
The ponies
refused to move their trees,

241
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,950
so we are stuck here,
and it is not fair!

242
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,280
See, Rainbow Dash?

243
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,330
They had
a good reason to --

244
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,790
I'll say
they had a good reason.

245
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,120
Come on.

246
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,420
We have some apple-picking
Appleloosians to talk to.

247
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,170
Ow!

248
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,220
Gently, please.

249
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,310
Sorry, Rarity,
but our friends are out there,

250
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,890
and we have to be
ready for a long hike
into buffalo territory

251
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,140
if we're gonna
save them.

252
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,310
Let's go!

253
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,820
Hi, guys.

254
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,400
Pinkie!

255
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,400
We're so glad
you're safe.

256
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,950
Oh, there you are.
Thank goodness.

257
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,120
How did you escape
from the buffalo?

258
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,740
We didn't.

259
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,290
We promised the buffalo
a chance to talk.

260
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,750
Oh, yeah?
About what?

261
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,750
We brought our new pal
Little Strongheart here

262
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,090
to explain
to the Appleloosians

263
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,800
why they should move
the apple trees

264
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,050
off buffalo land.

265
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,300
That information
will be quite help--

266
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,470
That's weird. 'Cause
my cousin Braeburn here

267
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,180
wants to explain
to the buffalo

268
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,220
why they should let
the apple trees stay.

269
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,100
That would be
a useful thing to --

270
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,310
The land is theirs!

271
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,350
You planted the trees
not knowing that.

272
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,310
Honest mistake.

273
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,480
Now you just got to move them.
That's all.

274
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,980
Well...

275
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,360
They busted
their rumps here.

276
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,820
And now they're supposed to
bust their rumps again

277
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,190
just 'cause some buffalo
won't stampede someplace else?

278
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,030
Plant the tree
somewhere else!

279
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,030
Where?

280
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,490
It's the only flatland
around these parts.

281
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,330
The buffalo had it first!

282
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,160
The settler ponies
need it to live!

283
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,830
Come on, Applejack!
I put my hoof down!
You're being unreasonable!

284
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,000
Look...

285
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,840
both the settlers
and the buffalo

286
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,500
have good reasons
to use this land.

287
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,960
There must be something
we can do.

288
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,380
Hey!
I've got an idea!

289
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,990
* We may be divided

290
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,320
* But of you all, I beg

291
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,780
* To remember we're all hoofed

292
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,450
* At the end of each leg

293
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,420
* No matter what the issue

294
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,170
* Come from wherever
you please *

295
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,040
* All this fighting
gets you nothing *

296
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,920
* But huff-and-mouth disease

297
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,420
* Arguing's not the way

298
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,010
* Hey, come out and play

299
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,050
* It's a shiny, new day

300
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,430
* So what do you say?

301
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,260
* You got to share

302
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,010
* You got to care

303
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,890
* It's the right thing to do

304
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,430
* You got to share

305
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,310
* You got to care

306
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,360
* And there'll always
Be a way through *

307
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,480
* Both our diets,
I should mention *

308
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,280
* Are completely vegetarian

309
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,030
* We all eat hay and oats

310
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,450
* Why be at
Each other's throat? *

311
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,320
* You got to share

312
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,080
* You got to care

313
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,490
* It's the right thing to do

314
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:52,040
* And there'll always be a way
Thro-o-o-o-ugh *

315
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,920
All right, Pinkie Pie!
That was fantastic!

316
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,220
What a great song!
You're right on!

317
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,470
It appears
that Sheriff Silverstar and I

318
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,430
have come to an agreement.

319
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,520
We have.

320
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,560
That was the worst performance
we've ever seen.

321
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,530
Abso-tively.

322
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,990
The time for action
is upon us.

323
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,570
Our stampede will start
at high noon tomorrow.

324
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,240
And if the orchard
is still there,

325
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,080
we'll flatten it
and the whole town!

326
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,330
But, Chief!

327
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,960
And we Appleloosians say
you'd better bring your best,

328
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,260
'cause we'll be ready
and waitin'.

329
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,630
But, Sheriff...

330
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Oh, that wasn't the message
of my song at all.

331
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,570
I want my kin to have
what they need to live,

332
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,950
but a storm's a-brewin' here,
and I don't like the look of it.

333
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,220
We've just got to talk
some sense into them

334
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,880
before somepony
gets hurt.

335
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,450
Listen, maybe if you would
just reconsider, we --

336
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,500
About the trees --
Now, if you could --

337
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,550
If we could just sit down
and talk, we could --

338
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,110
Why won't anybody
be rational and reasonable?!

339
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,000
Sheriff,
if we could only --

340
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,880
Isn't there some way
to stop this?

341
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,210
Unless the settlers
remove those trees,

342
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,140
I do not think so.

343
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,580
I know you don't want to
do this.

344
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,130
But they have taken
our land.

345
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,170
What would you have me do,
Rainbow Dash?

346
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,170
I don't know.

347
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,920
But it's never too late
to think of something.

348
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,550
At noon,
it will be too late.

349
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,070
Come on. Think.

350
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,820
Think, think, think, think,
think, think, think!

351
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,270
He's not gonna do it.

352
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,610
* ...say?
You got to share *

353
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,650
* You got to care

354
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,070
* It's the right thing to do

355
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,110
* You got to share

356
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,070
Cha-a-a-a-rge!

357
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,950
Whoa! Whoa!

358
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,830
Who-o-o-o-a!

359
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,500
Ready...

360
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,170
Aim...

361
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,800
Fire!

362
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,060
No-o-o-o!

363
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,790
Yum!

364
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,380
Hey!
I've got a much better idea.

365
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,270
We will allow the
apple orchard to stay

366
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,570
in exchange for a share
of its fruit --

367
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,400
those delicious apple pies.

368
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,580
I'd rather eat turquoise
any day of the week.

369
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,580
Ahh.

370
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,290
Bloomberg,
this is your special day.

371
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,210
Mama's so proud of you.

372
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,420
"Dear Princess Celestia,

373
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,140
"Friendship is a wondrous
and powerful thing.

374
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,220
"Even the worst of enemies
can become friends.

375
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,600
"You need understanding
and compromise.

376
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,440
You've got to share.
You've got to care."

377
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,020
Hey!
That's what I said!

378
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,320
* My Little Pony

379
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,450
* My Little Pony

380
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,000
* My Little Pony

381
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,050
* Friends
