1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,490
Spike, wake up!

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,750
Wake up, wake up!
It's Winter Wrap-Up day!

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,580
Huh?

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,580
Mommy?

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,420
Winter Wrap-Up.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,000
You're not mommy.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,010
Spike, the first day
of spring is tomorrow,

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,550
So every pony in ponyville
needs to clean up winter.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,390
It'll help me get ready.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,430
Clean up winter?
Who cleans up winter?

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,970
Don't they just use magic
to change the seasons

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,480
like we do in Canterlot?

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,390
No, Spike.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,560
Ponyville was started
by earth ponies,

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,560
so for hundreds of years,

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,900
they've never used magic
to clean up winter.

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,780
It's traditional.

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,620
It's ridiculous.
No magic. Pah!

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,910
Okay, let's see.

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,750
Scarf, check.
Saddle, check.

21
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,960
Boots, check.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,710
Spike refusing to get up and
going back to sleep, check.

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,500
It's a good thing
I'm so organized. I'm ready.

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,510
Bright and early.

25
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,760
Oh, maybe a little too early.

26
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,060
* My Little Pony

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,890
* My Little Pony

28
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,850

29
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,890
* My Little Pony

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,270
* I used to wonder
What friendship could be *

31
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,020
* My Little Pony

32
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,820
* Until you all shared
This magic with me *

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,900
* Big adventure
* Tons of fun

34
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,030
* A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong *

35
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,740
* Sharing kindness
* It's an easy feat

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,990
* And magic
Makes it all complete *

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,290
* Yeah, My Little Pony

38
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,540
* Do you know you're all
My very best friends? *

39
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,680
Those must be the team vests
Rarity designed.

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,510
Blue for the weather team,
green for the plant team,

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,270
and tan for the animal team.

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,520
I wonder which team vest
I'll be wearing.

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,190
I'll take a blue vest --

44
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,230
The same color
as my blankie,

45
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,610
which I think
I hear calling my name.

46
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,320
"Spike,
Spike, come to bed!"

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,030
It's too early.

48
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,450
Thank you, everypony, for being
here bright and early.

49
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,370
We need every single pony's help

50
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,750
to wrap up winter
and bring in spring.

51
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,590
Now, all of you have your vests

52
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,460
and have been assigned
to your teams,

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,630
so let's do even better
than last year

54
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,130
and have the quickest
Winter Wrap-Up ever.

55
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,310
Oh,
this is so exciting.

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,690
All right, everypony,
find your team leader

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,060
and let's get galloping.

58
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,520
Yeah!

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,610
Oh, gosh,
where should I go?

60
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,070
I'm not sure where I'd fit in.

61
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,660
What exactly
does everypony do?

62
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,080
* Three months of winter
Coolness and awesome holidays *

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,410
* We've kept our hoofsies warm
At home *

64
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,040
* Time off from work
To play *

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,250
* But the food we've stored
Is running out *

66
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,010
* And we can't grow
In this cold *

67
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,380
* And even though
I love my boots *

68
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,140
* This fashion's
Getting old *

69
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,510
* The time has come
To welcome spring *

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,100
* And all things
Warm and green *

71
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,020
* But it's also time
To say goodbye *

72
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,600
* It's winter,
We must clean *

73
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,360
* How can I help?
I knew you'd see *

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,440
* What does everypony do?

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
* How do I fit in
Without magic? *

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,450
* I haven't got a clue

77
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,530
* Winter Wrap-Up,
Winter Wrap-Up *

78
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,240
* Let's finish
Our holiday cheer *

79
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,490
* Winter Wrap-Up,
Winter Wrap-Up *

80
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,710
* 'Cause tomorrow
Spring is here *

81
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,540
* 'Cause tomorrow
Spring is here *

82
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,790
* Bringing home
The southern birds *

83
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,090
* Our pegasus' job begins

84
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,170
* And clearing all the gloomy
Skies to let the sunshine in *

85
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,390
* We the clouds
And we melt the white snow *

86
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,270
* When the sun comes up, its
Warmth and beauty will glow *

87
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,690
* Winter Wrap-Up,
Winter Wrap-Up *

88
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,690

* 'Cause tomorrow
Spring is here *

94
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,580
* Little critters hibernate
Under the snow and ice *

95
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,120
* We wake up all the sleepyheads
So quietly and nice *

96
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,340
* We help them gather up their
Food, fix their homes below *

97
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,670
* We welcome back
The southern birds *

98
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,130
* So their families
Can grow *

99
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,680

Ground, plant our tiny seeds *

* With proper care and sunshine,
Everyone it feeds *

108
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,660
* Apples, carrots, celery
Stalks, colorful flowers, too *

109
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,830
* We must work so very hard,
It's just so much to do *

With all of my heart *

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,740
* How will I do
Without my magic? *

122
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,860
* Help the earth pony way?

123
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,870
* I want to belong,
So I must do my best today *

124
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,290

133
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,020
Everypony
belongs to a team.

134
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,570
What should I do?
Where should I go?

135
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,530
All right, team,
you're cleared for takeoff.

136
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,530
Rainbow Dash.

137
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,620
Oh, hey, Twilight.
What's up?

138
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,910
What are you doing?

139
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,160
Sending off
one of my flight crews

140
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,660
to retrieve the birds that have
flown south for the winter.

141
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,410
Oh, can I help?

142
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,500
How about if I help
clear out the clouds?

143
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,380
Um...

144
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,000
Right, no wings.

145
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,010
Sorry, Twilight.

146
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,010
Great.
Now what do we do?

147
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,640
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna be napping.

148
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,770
Come on, Spike,
this is serious business!

149
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,850
Winter needs
to be wrapped up,

150
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,020
and I'm determined
to do my part...

151
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,070
somehow.

152
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,450
Rarity, please tell me
there's something, anything

153
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,740
I can help you with.

154
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,460
Well, how would you
like to help create

155
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,580
Ponyville's finest
bird's nests?

156
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,880
Bird's nests?

157
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,750
Why, yes.

158
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,710
When the weather team
guides the birds

159
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,050
back north for the spring,

160
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,720
they'll need a place to live
and lay their eggs.

161
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,970
Wow, Rarity.
That one's really beautiful.

162
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,970
Oh, why, thank you
most sincerely.

163
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,510
Would you like to try your hoof
at a nest?

164
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,600
Would I? Yes!
Where do I begin?

165
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,400
Okay, now, take some of that
straw and hay over there

166
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,730
and a little bit of branch.

167
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,780
Now, weave them
through there.

168
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,700
Yes! Take some ribbon.
Yes, ooh, n-not there.

169
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,450
Yes, uh, tuck it in over there,
but be careful not to...

170
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,750
no, no, no,
I guess that will do.

171
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, dear.

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,410
There!

173
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,460
It looks
just like...yours.

174
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,210
Oh, my.

175
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,840
That nest
needs to be condemned.

176
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,130
Oh, Spike.

177
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,840
It's not so bad.

178
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,470
Maybe the birds
can use it as an...

179
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,430
an outhouse?

180
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,850
Spike, it's just fine.

181
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,770
It's just a little rough
around the edges.

182
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,440
Let me lend you a hoof.
Let's just untie this ribbon.

183
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,940
And if we take out these sticks
here, reshape this.

184
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,110
I think we lost her.

185
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,650
And we need
to weave this string in.

186
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,950
Hello, Twilight!

187
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,450
Wheee!

188
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,910
Wow, Pinkie Pie,
you're quite the skater.

189
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,580
Probably the best skater
I've ever seen.

190
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,000
Thanks, Twilight.

191
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,170
I've been doing this

192
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,710
since I was an itty-bitty,
little, little twinkie Pinkie.

193
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,630
Just comes naturally.

194
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,880
Which is probably why they
designated me the lake scorer.

195
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,890
I cut lines in the lake
with my skates.

196
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,510
That way, when the rest of
the weather team comes here

197
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,520
to break the ice,
it'll be easy as pie.

198
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,730
How clever.

199
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,690
When the thick ice
begins to melt,

200
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,060
it'll break along the lines.

201
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,110
Well, you sure have
a lot of work ahead of you.

202
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,900
There's quite a few lakes
in Ponyville.

203
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,530
Tell me about it!

204
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,200
Hey, Twilight,
want to help me out?

205
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,070
Would I!

206
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,570
Come on, put on those skates
over there.

207
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,160
I bet you'll be a natural,
too.

208
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,040
Okay.

209
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,790
Yay!

210
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,500
Uh, maybe
on second thought...

211
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,960
What are you talking about?

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,750
You said you wanted
to be helpful.

213
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,750
Yippee!

214
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,010
Now get out there.

215
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,590
Whoa! Whoa!

216
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,090
Twilight, steer!
Steer!

217
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,510
Ya!

218
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh, boy!

219
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,760
Whaa!
Whaa!

220
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,230
Ugh!

221
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,070
Brr!

222
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,030
You are a natural, Twilight --
A natural disaster!

223
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,070
Twilight, you did a great job
your first time around.

224
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,620
I'm sure my first time

225
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,040
was just as wobbly and bobbly
and crasherrific as yours!

226
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,790
Really?

227
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,920
No.

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,880
But did I make you
feel better?

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,550
Yeah, I guess.

230
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,130
I bet you'll be super awesome
at something

231
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,760
that keeps your hooves
on the ground.

232
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,180
I know! Fluttershy could
probably use your help

233
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,140
with the critters.

234
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,600
Well, I'm pretty good
with little animals.

235
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,140
Yeah, I'll go help her.

236
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,890
Uh, it's, uh, thataway.

237
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,810
Ya!

238
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,650
Wake up,
little sleepyheads.

239
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,660
Hope you had some wonderful
dreams and restful hibernation,

240
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,780
but it's time
to get up now.

241
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,990
Spring is coming.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,170
Aw, how cute.

243
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,290
Aren't they?

244
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,000
This is my favorite task
of the whole season,

245
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,010
when I get to see all my little
animal friends again.

246
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,800
Uh, what's hibernation?

247
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,640
It's like a long sleep.

248
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,060
Long sleep?

249
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,310
Yes.

250
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,060
Wake up, little porcupines.

251
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,650
Animals often hibernate
through the winter

252
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,940
to save their energy
and eat less food.

253
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,690
I definitely like the idea
of hibernation,

254
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,950
except for the
"eat less food" part.

255
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, but just look at all these
warrens and dens.

256
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,080
I'm worried that I won't be able
to wake up every animal

257
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,290
before spring comes.

258
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,750
Well, I'll help,
Fluttershy.

259
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,050
Oh, you will?
Oh, that would be wonderful.

260
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,220
Okay.

261
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,180
Let's start there.

262
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,680
Hello?

263
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,230
Wake up, little friends,
wherever you are.

264
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,100
Spring is coming.

265
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:50,740
I wonder which cute, little,
furry creatures I've awoken.

266
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,070
Aah, snakes! Snakes!

267
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,330
Aaaaaaah!

268
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,290
Ugh!

269
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,080
Ooh!

270
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,210
Aaaaah!

271
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,250
Oof!

272
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,380
Good morning, friends.

273
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,220
Oh, all this
Winter Wrap-Up stuff

274
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,680
is a lot harder
than it looks.

275
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,260
Right,
because there's no magic.

276
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,310
Why don't you just use magic,
Twilight,

277
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,270
and get it done
the right way?

278
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,100
No, Spike.

279
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,190
I have to do it
the traditional way.

280
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,190
Ponyville has never needed magic
to wrap up winter.

281
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,230
But they never had you here
before, either.

282
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,320
Think about how much quicker
they could wrap up winter

283
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,700
with your magic.

284
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,740
No, no, no!

285
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,990
I'm gonna find some other way
that I can help out

286
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,160
If it kills me!

287
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,790
Keep pushing, Caramel.
That's it, Bumpkin.

288
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,130
I know it's hard work,
but you guys are doing great.

289
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,040
Yeehaw!

290
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,050
Hey, Applejack,
how's everything going?

291
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,050
Oh, just dandy.

292
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,260
Little slow starting,
but peachy, all the same.

293
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,090
There's a lot of ground
to clear, you hear?

294
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,100
We can't even start the planting
and the watering

295
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,720
until we get all this heap
of snow hightailed out of here.

296
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,850
Well, I'd like to help.

297
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,440
Well, I-I don't know,
Twilight.

298
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,150
Just give me a chance.

299
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,360
Well, I never turn down
a hard worker, but...

300
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,460
Think of how much quicker
they could wrap up winter

301
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,290
with your magic?

302
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,800
I could use
a come-to-life spell.

303
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,220
Oh, here goes.

304
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,900
Hmm, she's awful strong
for such a little pony.

305
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,490
That's my girl!
Following my advice.

306
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,330
And what in tarnation
does that mean?

307
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,090
Uh-oh. Slow down.
Slow down!

308
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,220
Oh!

309
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,560
Whoa-oh-oa!

310
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,360
What's going on?
What'd you do?

311
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,360
You used magic,
didn't you?

312
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,130
Nuts, Twilight!
You used magic!

313
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,970
The nerve!
Can you believe her?

314
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,100
That's not how we do it
'round here, Twilight,

315
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,470
and especially
not on my farm!

316
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,100
Well, see,
I just wanted to --

317
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
Oh!

318
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,240
Come on, Twilight,
come on out.

319
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,870
I'm a winter mess up.

320
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,210
Well, you're good
at a lot of things,

321
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,630
just not nest making,
ice skating,

322
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,630
animal waking,
snow clearing.

323
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,720
Thanks a lot for making me feel
so much better.

324
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,760
That's what I'm here for,
sister.

325
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,850
Rainbow Dash,
y'all on the weather team

326
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,640
need to melt the rest of this
snow here on the ground

327
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
and the trees pronto.

328
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,390
Got it!
You can't.

329
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,690
My poor little animals' homes
will get flooded

330
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,230
if the snow
melts too fast.

331
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,360
Got it?

332
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
I'm telling you, Rainbow,
you got to melt that snow now.

333
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,320
No!
You simply must wait.

334
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,320
Okay.

335
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,110
Go!
Stop!

336
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,740
Go!
Stop!

337
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,330
Ugh!
Make up your minds!

338
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,750
Oh, what in Equestria
are all you arguing about?

339
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,790
This sort of silliness is why
were late for spring last year,

340
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,340
and the year before that,
and the year before that!

341
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,800
Did she say late?

342
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,180
I was hoping my amazingly
inspirational speech

343
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,850
would urge everyone
to do better than last year,

344
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,020
but now it looks like we're
going to be later than ever!

345
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,190
I mean, just look
at this catastrophe!

346
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,270
The ice scorers made
the ice chunks too big to melt.

347
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,820
The nest designer's
horrendously behind.

348
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,740
We need several hundred,
and she's only made one.

349
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,860
And don't get me started on all
the clouds still in the sky,

350
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,990
the icicles on the trees.

351
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,370
This isn't good.
Not at all!

352
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,750
And it's gonna be all-to-pieces
disastrous

353
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,750
if we can't get our seeds
all planted.

354
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,920
Chillax, Applejack!

355
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,380
We're busting our chops
as fast as we can.

356
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,130
No, not fast.
You have to wake animals slowly.

357
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,130
Uh, A.J.?

358
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,390
Oh, good gravy!

359
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,430
Caramel lost the grass seeds
again, didn't he?

360
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,640
Eeyup.

361
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,850
Ditzy Doo accidentally went
north to get the southern birds.

362
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,190
Oh, that featherbrain!

363
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,020
Didn't she learn her lesson
last year when she went west?

364
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,400
Stop this at once!

365
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,280
We don't have time to argue!

366
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,820
It's almost sundown.

367
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,160
Spring is going to be late
again.

368
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,870
Another year
of scandal and shame!

369
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,960
If only we could be
more organized.

370
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Spike, get my checklist
and clipboard -- Stat!

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,130
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,840
Stop, everypony!

373
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,180
Stop!

374
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,810
Sorry.

375
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,350
I know you all want
to complete your jobs on time,

376
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,890
but arguing
is no way to go about it.

377
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,480
What you need is organization,

378
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,440
and I'm just the pony
for the job.

379
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,080
I can't believe it!

380
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,950
Spring is here
on time!

381
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,960
And we have you
to thank for it.

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,080
If it weren't for your
organizing skills,

383
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,500
we would
still be arguing.

384
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,960
Eeyup.

385
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,300
It was a team effort.

386
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,340
And since
you helped every team,

387
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,430
we have an official vest
for you.

388
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,350
We give you
the title all-team organizer.

389
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,190
Gosh, I don't even know
what to say.

390
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,650
Thank you, everypony.

391
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:51,320
And hereby I declare that winter
is wrapped up on time!

392
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
Spike's sure gonna be in
for a hog-sized surprise

393
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,580
when that last piece
of ice melts.

394
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,120
"Dear Princess Celestia,

395
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,540
"Winter Wrap-Up was one of
the most special things

396
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,130
"I've ever been a part of
here in Ponyville.

397
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,130
"It helped me to learn that
we all have hidden talents,

398
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,970
"and if we're patient
and diligent,

399
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,430
"we're sure to find them.

400
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,550
"And as always, with good
friendship and teamwork,

401
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,520
ponies can accomplish anything."

402
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,310
How's that, Spike?

403
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,350
Spike?

404
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,650
Oh, Spike.

406
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,620
