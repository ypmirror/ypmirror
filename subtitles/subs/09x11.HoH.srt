422
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,638
              Wait!

423
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:07,789
    [happy clucking]

424
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:11,516
     This is Edith. She's
   helping me with my project.

425
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,652
       I.. don't understand.

426
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,455
     After you encouraged me
    to solve my own problem,

427
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,758
   I decided to get my
   project done <i>before</i> I left.

428
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,927
     That way I could really
     focus on my family

429
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,164
   during my visit. The school
   was closed so I came here.

430
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,198
   Why didn't you tell anyone?

431
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,900
  Mom and Dad are worried sick!

432
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,636
      Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

433
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,004
 Once Edith volunteered to help,

434
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,006
  I guess I lost track of time.

435
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,675
Cockatrice's are really friendly

436
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,344
       if you know how to
       interact with them.

437
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,514
           [clucking]

438
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,082
 I can't believe you figured out

439
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,351
       how to trigger her
        nesting response.

440
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,020
     They are really
     fascinating creatures.

441
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,122
 Did you know that they migrate

442
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,990
        to the Everfree
       Forest once a year!

443
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,959
        Can you <i>imagine</i>
        what would happen

444
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,327
      if you stumbled on a
      whole flock of these!?

445
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,631
       I have a few ideas...

446
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,267
              Agh!

447
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,904
    I'm sorry you got turned
    to stone looking for me,

448
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,808
     but I'm glad Edith was
     able to turn you back.

449
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,243
 How do you tell the difference..?

450
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,945
 I have mixed feelings about it.

451
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,815
     Technically, I will
     always be a stick pony,

452
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,617
 but the experience has given me

453
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,218
   an even deeper appreciation

454
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,821
       for the density and
       permanence of rock.

455
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,756
             Swoon.

456
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,892
       Silverstream and I
        should get going,

457
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,327
    but I wanted to thank you

458
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,296
       for everything you
      did to help find her.

459
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,631
       I just wish I
      hadn't abandoned her

460
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,233
       in the first place...

461
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,801
       Starlight, you
       didn't abandon her.

462
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,270
      I might as well have!

463
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,971
      And even though it
      turned out all right,

464
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,040
        things could have
        been a lot worse.

465
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,576
    You can't be expected to
    supervise your students

466
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,311
   every second of every day.

467
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,679
        I'm not so sure...

468
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,681
       I like that you're
        always available,

469
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,883
      but it kind of makes
      it OK to come to you

470
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,786
     with stuff that maybe
     isn't <i>super</i> important.

471
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,922
       Of course, being a
        school counselor

472
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,790
    is a big responsibility,

473
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,860
    but always being at work
     isn't fair to anypony.

474
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,963
         Especially me.

475
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,198
      Do you think if I had
      set times to see me,

476
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,633
    it might help you decide

477
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,369
        what you really
       need to talk about?

478
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,138
    To be honest, you really
     weren't very helpful

479
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,706
  with the other stuff anyway.

480
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,208
        Yeah... Wait, what!?

481
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,444
       Happy Spring
     Sols-tastic, everypony!

482
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,613
      Who wants a piece of
      Mrs. Cake's famous--

483
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:23,347
             [clank]

484
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,583
      Sunburst: Petrified dessert!?

485
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,918
          You had me
          at "petrified".

486
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,021
