1
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,178
        Ha ha ha ha ha!

2
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:15,003
     You're gonna have to
     work faster than that

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,515
    if you plan to dig up
    my whole village, lass.

4
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:18,818
          Let me help.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,685
            Ah!

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,490
    Er, thank you, Rockhoof.

7
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:27,259
      But we're trying to
      carefully preserve

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,561
   every bit of history here.

9
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,666
       Aye, this place is
       full of memories.

10
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,972
 Did I tell you about the time
 our chieftain knocked down

11
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,875
     five boulders with the
      kick of a wee ball?

12
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,511
         OH! STOP THAT!

13
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,481
  But.. that's what this is for.

14
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,283
              Maybe in the past!

15
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,586
  Now, it belongs in a museum!

16
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,423
  Safe. Preserved. Untouched.

17
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,259
   Bah! Next you'll be saying
   I shouldn't have used

18
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,760
      the old sweat lodge.

19
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:12,004
 So you see why Rockhoof isn't
 an ideal fit for my team.

20
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:17,009
  Perhaps you could use
   his, uh, <i>unusual talents</i>?

21
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,878
  Of course, Professor Fossil!

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,947
We'd be honored to have a Pillar
 of Equestria on our staff.

23
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,615
        Oh thank Celestia.

24
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,021
             Blech!

25
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,823
   Agh that apple's made of wood!

26
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,558
 What a horrible trick to play!

27
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,131
Hm.  Has anypony seen my
decorative centerpieces?

28
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,332
They were right here.

29
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:42,835
                  Good luck!

30
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,712
    So join me in welcoming
   Professor Rockhoof

31
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,080
        to our faculty!

32
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,386
   Thank you, thank you all.

33
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,123
I know I'm new to your world,
but there's one thing I learned

34
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:42,161
when I saved my village from
a rushing river of hot lava...

35
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,831
  There's nothing you can't do
  with hard work... and a shovel!

36
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,339
  Except maybe stand on stage..

37
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,748
So, um, everycreature
dismissed!

38
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,816
   We'll... see you in class!

39
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,087
       You think that new
        pony is gonna be

40
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,089
       the weirdest
       teacher at school?

41
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,057
  Or just one of the weirdest?

42
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,959
     Yona like new teacher!

43
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,128
       He big, like yak!

44
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,430
And he smashes
things like a yak.

45
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,399
    He smells like a yak...

46
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,369
        Yes! He perfect.

47
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,171
Guys, he's one
of the Pillars!

48
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,740
He's like...
Pony history!

49
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,709
          HELLO CLASS!

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,713
          Well, Um...

51
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,116
I'm er.. your new "Theory and
Defense of Friendship" teacher.

52
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,687
       But I haven't had
       a chance to look

53
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,456
      at Headmare
     Twilight's notes yet.

54
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,425
       What have you all
        been learning?

55
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,493
 We just studied all about how
  Princess Celestia and Luna

56
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,430
      used a spell to trap
     Discord in stone sleep

57
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:52,665
     for hundreds of moons.

58
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,866
         Oh, hohoho...

59
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,502
     so it's a class
     about stories, is it?

60
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,171
         Stories, yeah!

61
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,440
      And we never, ever,
      ever get homework.

62
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,376
     Good! The best way to
    teach colts and fillies

63
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,178
       is by experience.

64
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,350
Like the time I was in the woods
and ran across an Ursa Major.

65
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,517
    Really!?

66
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,852
                 We're not doing
                 that, right?

67
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,955
     You fight Ursa Major?

68
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,889
           All alone?

69
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,760
        Aye! And I
       defeated her too!

70
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,428
  Now this, I'm interested in.

71
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,597
  How Professor Rockhoof win?

72
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,768
   Well, that's quite a tale.

73
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,205
From what Professor Fossil said,
 it sounds like Rockhoof

74
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,540
    just hasn't settled into
    modern times yet.

75
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,809
    Our school is the
    perfect place for that.

76
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,511
  Plus, we get a new teacher!

77
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,247
    Heh. This may be the fastest
   friendship problem

78
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,248
        you ever solved.

79
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,487
  Dodge! Thrust! Shovel Leap!
    Shovel Throw!

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,660
         Shovel Whack!

81
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,462
 Now you lot be the Ursa Major.

82
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,131
     Lotsa growling, mind!

83
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,502
          Ha ha ha ha!

84
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,908
      Maybe classrooms were less
      breakable in the old days?

85
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,677
       Ooh ooh ooh! What
       happened next?

86
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,948
    Heh heh. The huge beastie jumped
    out of the moonlit mist,

87
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,118
her fearsome fangs at my throat!

88
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,752
      But I rolled clear!

89
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,021
           Then what!?

90
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:28,093
    She backed me up against
    a wall, ready to pounce!

91
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:32,331
       I looked at her...
       she looked at me.

92
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,632
          And I say--

93
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,933
                    Uh Professor
                    Rockhoof?

94
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:35,934
Nope, guess again!

95
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,736
Ahem. Oops.

96
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,171
             Sorry to interrupt.

97
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,474
  Class, why don't we go ahead
  and take lunch early today?

98
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,876
      Rockhoof, can we
      take a walk outside?

99
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,450
Our school is about finding
 your own special way to teach.

100
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,754
  And we can already tell
 you're a smash with the class!

101
00:05:56,156 --> 00:06:00,259
But maybe you could do a little
less smashing in the classroom?

102
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,795
  Sorry about that. I did get
  a bit carried away.

103
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,798
    The students were so
     interested in my tale!

104
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,603
   I know it's a big change,

105
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,372
      but I think you're
      gonna fit in just--

106
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,611
             FIRE!

107
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,812
       Rockhoof, wait!

108
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,614
No time! The building's ablaze!

109
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,316
 We have to get everypony out!

110
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,718
              Professor Rockhoof
              best teacher ever!

111
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,087
          [sigh] Day cannot get better!

112
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,557
       Let's get you
       outside, wee ones!

113
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,560
      Day just got better!

114
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:37,030
            Wow!

115
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,797
           Ally-Oop!

116
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,199
Rockhoof!

117
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,501
      What are you doing!?

118
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,802
       Saving the school!

119
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,910
  Just like fighting a volcano
 in the good old days!

120
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:56,081
                 Would somepony
                  kindly explain

121
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,250
             what is the meaning
             of all this water?

122
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,353
        I'm not sure, but I
         think it's "Surf's up!"

123
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,221
      Wheeeeee! Cowabunga!

124
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,257
         Sorry, Rarity.

125
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,492
      But I had to put out
      the raging inferno!

126
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,460
Inferno? Where?

127
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,896
Did you not see the
smoke and flame?

128
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,597
              Yeah, that was us.

129
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,799
                Y'know, DRAGONS?

130
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,235
          Having a firebreathing
           competition?

131
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,104
          You... what?

132
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,006
They do it all the time.

133
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,041
      That's what we were
      trying to tell you.

134
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,677
We know you're used to
being a hero, Rockhoof.

135
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,148
      Only... what we need
       here is a teacher.

136
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,618
One who doesn't ruin an entire
class's friendship quilts!

137
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,022
Do you know how hard it is to
stitch a pineapple pattern!?

138
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,193
   Oh. My deepest apologies.

139
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,728
      I'm not used to
      living with dragons.

140
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,131
       Or much else in
       this modern time.

141
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,267
                Professor Fossil
                made it clear

142
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,936
            I'm not welcome back
            in my old village.

143
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,371
             Seems I don't
             belong here either.

144
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,810
            WHEEEE!

145
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,418
   So apparently,
   finding Rockhoof a new job

146
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,320
is a lot harder than we thought.

147
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,389
   Has anypony had any luck?

148
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,091
          Uh uh. Nope.

149
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,230
  I thought you were gonna try
  him out at the post office.

150
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,364
            We did.

151
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,003
   Do you know where I can
   find Cranky Doodle Donkey?

152
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,205
I need to deliver his medicine!

153
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:31,076
    He has a rash in a very
   embarrassing place!

154
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,819
     [shudder] I did not
      need to hear that.

155
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,356
      Yep! Rockhoof's time
       as a spa masseuse

156
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,991
    didn't work out either.

157
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,929
  Now just let me know if
   this is too much PRESSURE.

158
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,370
   Well, at least Rockhoof's
     really strong.

159
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,774
   Maybe we could find him a
   job carrying heavy stuff?

160
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,543
     I tried that already!

161
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,246
   Zecora needed somepony to
 help her get supplies, but...

162
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,785
    I know you said you only
    needed a few leaves,

163
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,687
     but I figured why not
   bring you the whole thing?

164
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,295
        Oh, how horrid.

165
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,597
None of the other Pillars
seem to be having trouble

166
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,466
fitting in to the modern world.

167
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,635
   Then maybe they can show
   Rockhoof how they did it.

168
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,871
     Get him used to
      livin' in this time.

169
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,356
          Great idea!

170
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,440
   Rockhoof's old friends
    would be happy to help.

171
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,309
     And I bet he'd
      love to visit them.

172
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,415
             Hmph.

173
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,152
   Even Canterlot looks
  different from the old days.

174
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,755
   Aw, I'm sure once you see
   your ol' pal Flash Magnus,

175
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,257
   you'll feel right at home.

176
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,761
Trot, 2, 3, 4!
Trot, 2, 3, 4!

177
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,864
    Keep it lively, rookies!

178
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,000
       Visitors on site!

179
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,902
         Company, halt!

180
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,474
       Rockhoof, you old
       ditch-digger you!

181
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,877
       Flash Magnus, as I
       live and breathe!

182
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,246
     Is this your squadron?

183
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,782
After we got out of limbo, I
went looking for work for a pony

184
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,684
       with experience in
       the Royal Legion.

185
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,387
        Once a soldier,
       always a soldier.

186
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,089
 Princess Celestia was happy to
find a new drill sergeant

187
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,358
         for her Guard!

188
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,694
         Yeah.. that's great.

189
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,764
    She really put you in a
    job that big... so soon?

190
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,799
            Oh, this is nothing!

191
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,768
             You should see what
             Mistmane is up to.

192
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,974
    They made <i>you</i> the Royal
    Landscape Artist

193
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,710
    for the Crystal Empire?

194
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:45,777
Wow.

195
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,883
      Your work is
      beautiful!

196
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,814
           Oh thank you.

197
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,317
     I've never worked
      with crystal before,

198
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,322
    but in my heart, I know
    I'm where I belong.

199
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,724
           You always could find
           the beauty in things.

200
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,695
But there's not much demand for
shovel ponies like me nowadays.

201
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,498
Don't give up hope!

202
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,433
See Somnambula.

203
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,302
She'll help you
find your purpose.

204
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,307
     Somnambula's a
     motivational speaker.

205
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,844
   Bet they didn't even have
   those back in your time.

206
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,812
Because we didn't
need them.

207
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,881
Ponies knew what to
do with their lives.

208
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:29,421
Focus on my voice, and feel
yourself unlock your potential.

209
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:43,535
 Imagine everything that
 troubles you as one big cloud.

210
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,905
     Now let it float away.

211
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,107
        You are relaxed.

212
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,411
 Free to do anything you wish.

213
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,585
       Guess he wished he
       could take a nap?

214
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,489
  Rockhoof: Mage Meadowbrook!

215
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,526
    Your home looks just the
     same as the old days.

216
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,494
        Wish I could say
       the same for mine.

217
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,231
Well, I've had to
expand my clinic a bit.

218
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,468
Many creatures need healing
in this modern world.

219
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,372
Oh! Looks like you
could use some too.

220
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,074
What's got you
heartsick, Rockhoof?

221
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,047
    Thing is, I can't do
     my old job like Flash.

222
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,849
    Or adapt like Mistmane.

223
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,785
    Or succeed at something
     new like Somnambula.

224
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,821
     Or go home, like you.

225
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,440
Give it time.

226
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,858
Even Starswirl's still
learning about friendship...

227
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:41,827
       Applejack: Yeah!

228
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,196
    And I bet Stygian took
   plenty of time to fit in.

229
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,765
 Hey, look what I found!

230
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,768
      "Me and My Shadow,"
      the third hit novel

231
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,736
   by former villain Stygian!

232
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,705
      I'm impressed! He's
       really thriving!

233
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,510
      Rockhoof? Where are
       you going?

234
00:12:58,912 --> 00:12:59,962
         I'm not sure.

235
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:02,813
   Maybe I just don't belong
   in this modern world.

236
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,319
     Now this here is a
     right mash of apples.

237
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,689
      'Stead of solving
      Rockhoof's problem,

238
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,557
  we made him feel even worse.

239
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,193
       I'll tell you the
       real problem here!

240
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,030
 We haven't given Rockhoof the
 chance to be who he really is.

241
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,867
   A pony with a metal shovel
   and a heart of gold?

242
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,202
           Tch. A hero!

243
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:28,340
 What we need to do is find him
 a job that's as epic as he is!

244
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,844
       Hm. I might know
       just the thing...

245
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,415
     Rockhoof: I'm honored to serve
    in the Hippogriff Navy,

246
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,683
       General Seaspray.

247
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,086
 I promise I'll prove my worth.

248
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,755
      Think nothing of it.

249
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:47,058
   I know how hard it is
    to adapt to a new home.

250
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,961
      After our many years
        below the waves,

251
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,231
  land customs seemed strange.

252
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,167
  Like you didn't fit in, no
   matter how hard you tried?

253
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,504
    As though the world had
     moved on without us.

254
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,372
     Never fear, Rockhoof!

255
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:07,779
We shall be as brothers in this
bright future above the waves.

256
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,949
     Uh, why do the
     Hippogriffs need ships

257
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,851
        if they can turn
        into seaponies?

258
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,686
 Maybe they just like cruises?

259
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,038
            General!

260
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,889
   The fog's too thick to see
   our way out of the harbor!

261
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,962
      Heave to, swabbies!

262
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:28,867
     Halt the ship and hold
    her till the fog passes!

263
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,436
         Wait, General!

264
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,204
  We can navigate the same way
  my Coltic ancestors traveled

265
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,309
   through the Selkie Mists!
   We'll look to the stars!

266
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,244
        There in the
         northwest sky

267
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,913
      is the constellation
     for O'Bridle's Pelt!

268
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,416
  Steer the ship toward that!

269
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,584
   You heard the pony, crew!

270
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,153
        Make full sail!

271
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,694
    Yeehaw! Rockhoof did it!

272
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,330
   But... I don't understand!

273
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,900
     The stars have always
     steered me true!

274
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,070
          Oh, no. Stars can move
          slowly over time.

275
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,139
They must look different now
than over a thousand years ago.

276
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,910
It was an honor serving
with you, Rockhoof.

277
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:16,915
But it seems our paths lie
in different directions.

278
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,322
                Hey, mistakes happen.

279
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,358
        We'll think of something
        else for you to do!

280
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,027
   Oh, there's no need, lass.

281
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,162
      I already know what
      I want to do next.

282
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,897
         Really? What?

283
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,333
       I heard there's a
      statue spell

284
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,869
      that sends creatures
       into stone sleep.

285
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,671
     I want you to cast it.

286
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,706
             On me.

287
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,579
         Twilight: No!

288
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,347
        Rockhoof: Yes!

289
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,881
             -No!
             -Aye!

290
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,384
              No!

291
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,318
              AYE!

292
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,453
           Hey guys.

293
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,555
      Need me to help you
      decide something?

294
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,860
Rockhoof wants me to cast a
spell to turn him into a statue.

295
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,794
       The answer is no.

296
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,365
Well, it should be "aye", because
 I wouldn't even be here

297
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,899
   to be turned into a statue

298
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,036
   if Twilight hadn't cast a
   spell in the first place!

299
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,173
Whoa. I thought you were
arguing over ice cream flavors.

300
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,543
    The answer is still no!

301
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,545
     Why would you want to
     be turned into stone?

302
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,981
      Because I'm a relic
       of a bygone age.

303
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,616
     I belong in a museum.

304
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,417
             Safe.

305
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,318
           Preserved.

306
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,520
           Untouched.

307
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,822
I don't belong in this time.

308
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,757
It's up to you to
make that right!

309
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,126
                But there has to
                be a better way!

310
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,261
  Twilight, please understand.

311
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,831
    I want to be remembered
     as the hero I was.

312
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,200
     Not the disappointment
      I've become.

313
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,401
But you're not!

314
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:44,936
Rockhoof, wait!

315
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,540
      Spike, can you teach
        my class today?

316
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,643
  Er, you're not really going to
  turn him to stone, are you?

317
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,878
  Only because it's temporary.

318
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,846
       As soon as I think
       of a new solution,

319
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,348
    we'll wake Rockhoof up.

320
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,185
I KNOW he has more to offer the
world as a pony than a statue.

321
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,223
Did you hear Rockhoof caught all
the bees in the Everfree Forest,

322
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,924
        and gave 'em to
       Zecora as a gift?

323
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,194
  Wow! Terramar said Rockhoof
  called down the stars

324
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,530
       and sunk the whole
        Hippogriff navy!

325
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,466
          He's definitely weird.
          But in a fun way.

326
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,869
     You never know what's
     gonna happen next with him.

327
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,505
 Professor Rockhoof best pony!

328
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,040
          Hey, class.

329
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,143
   Welcome to the Theory and
    Defense of Friendship.

330
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,578
          Another sub?

331
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,512
    Let me start by telling
   you we don't get homework,

332
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,516
  and we only do field trips.

333
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,751
        Yeah, nice try.

334
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,887
   Er, Twilight sent me to tell
   you she won't be in today

335
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,856
 'cause she has to cast a stone
sleep spell on Rockhoof.

336
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,593
          Like Discord? But why!?

337
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,362
       Rockhoof isn't a bad guy!

338
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:45,841
              Hm.

339
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,200
     Your instructions are
     to write an essay on

340
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,535
     "Heroism: And What It
      Means To You."

341
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,004
              No!

342
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,338
        Oh, don't worry.

343
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,906
       It doesn't have to
       be a long essay.

344
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,178
        Maybe like.. this?

345
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,713
    Or on three legs... Hmm.

346
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:07,018
 What will give the wee birds
 fewer places to uh, decorate?

347
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,386
      Yona: Professor Rockhoof!

348
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,888
      Dragon said you want
      to turn into stone!

349
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,125
      Yona not believe it!

350
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,495
Aye, I'm afraid it's true, lass.

351
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:21,499
  But... Pony need finish
  Ursa Major story for class!

352
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:25,136
    It's sweet of you to try
    to get me to stay, Yona.

353
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,939
     But... I'm afraid old
      stories like mine

354
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,910
     aren't worth anything
     in this day and age.

355
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,113
     Fine! If Pony no want
     tell Yona story,

356
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,448
   then Yona tell Pony story!

357
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,985
       From class report!

358
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,255
    "When Yona come to Pony
    school, Yona not fit in.

359
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,124
       Pony ways strange.

360
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,992
     But Yona find friends!

361
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,728
 Yona meet Professor Rockhoof.

362
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,798
 Pony brave and strong as Yak!

363
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,734
       Not afraid! Hero!"

364
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,535
       When Yona grow up,

365
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,472
   Yona want to be just like
   Professor Rockhoof!"

366
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,442
      Well.... since you went
       to the trouble

367
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,479
      of writing something
      that nice, I suppose

368
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,181
  the least I could do is tell
   you the rest of the story.

369
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,821
     Yona tell whole school
     Rockhoof is best!

370
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,923
  Now ALL want to hear story!

371
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,561
     OK. I have the spell,

372
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,397
     but will you please
     reconsider. Rockhoof!?

373
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,667
    The Ursa Major tried to
    grab me by the gullet!

374
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,135
    But I ducked her claws!

375
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,307
      She had me cornered.

376
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,143
       So I look at her..
        she looks at me.

377
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:46,250
And I say, "Sorry you won't be
having any dinner tonight, lass!

378
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,387
     Guess you'll just have
     to.. grin and bear it!"

379
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:55,326
And then I tossed her away with
 my shovel, high into the sky!

380
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,663
 And she's been a constellation
   up there ever since.

381
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:00,932
        Or so I'm told.

382
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,634
And that's the end of my story.

383
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,072
        One more story!
        One more story!

384
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,374
        No no. Thank you
         for listening.

385
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,309
 But it's time to say good-bye.

386
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,780
      Wait!

387
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,781
 You said there wasn't anything
 in this time you were good at.

388
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,784
  What about telling stories?

389
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,821
   It was just a tall tale...

390
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,390
     One that captured the
     hearts and imagination

391
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,092
     of everycreature here.

392
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,662
   Plus pony story super fun!

393
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,868
 As the Princess of Friendship,
 I'd like to appoint you

394
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,939
    as Equestria's official
    Keeper of Tales!

395
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,007
        Can you do that?

396
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,342
         Meh.

397
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,778
      I uh.... That's
       very kind of you.

398
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,748
  But I still think these old
  bones are more suited

399
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,517
      to a museum display.

400
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,453
You are a living
record of our history.

401
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,923
Your stories can inspire and
teach generations to come!

402
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,693
If you're a statue,
that's all lost.

403
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,696
     But will I ever really
     belong in your world?

404
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,665
         Rockhoof Yona's friend.

405
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,167
      So Rockhoof belongs.

406
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:14,539
     You know, that reminds
     me of another story...

407
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:20,411
Once there was a small Yak that
knew more than a great hero.

408
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,614
     Hey, don't forget the
     dragons in this one!

409
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,349
    Aye, there were dragons!

410
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,118
          And ponies.

411
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,353
   And plenty of hippogriffs...

412
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,123
     Plus a changeling and
     a griffon that flew...
