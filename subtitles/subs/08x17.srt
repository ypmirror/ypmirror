1
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:09,208
     Oh! Rarity! Just the
     pony I'm looking for.

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,077
Can you come to Twilight's class
  with me? It won't take long.

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,179
     Oh, I'd love to help,

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,149
but I have to meet Rainbow Dash
 for our day of fun together.

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,185
  Twilight wants to use you as
  an example for the students.

6
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,220
             Oooh!

7
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,891
     Your example is here!
      Ha ha! Oh!

8
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,595
  I thought I was the example.

9
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,864
You both are. Because together,
   you perfectly demonstrate

10
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,267
    my lesson on compromise
      in friendship!

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,736
  Rainbow Dash and Rarity have
    very different interests

12
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:41,106
that keep them busy. But being
friends is so important to them,

13
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,742
   they always manage to
   make time for each other.

14
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,878
Our Day of Fun was hard to plan,

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,481
    what with Rainbow Dash's
    extremely time-consuming

16
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,984
   and erratically scheduled
    Wonderbolts practice...

17
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,686
       And Rarity's<i> weird</i>
        fashion seasons.

18
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,588
      She's working on her
       winter collection

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,624
 and it's not even summer yet!

20
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,360
      But you still found
      time to be together,

21
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,095
    and that's what counts!

22
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,364
       See, class? These
       ponies are models

23
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,399
 of true friendship in action.

24
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,504
    Thanks for stopping by!
    Enjoy your "Day of Fun"!

25
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:16,442
  Ooh, ooh! What amazing stuff
   are you gonna do together?

26
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,177
Shoe shopping!
                           Obstacle races!

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,411
Dress shopping!

28
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,946
             Flight goggle shopping!

29
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,984
        Aw, come ON! I even said
         <i> shopping</i> that time!

30
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,252
Perfect! We'll go
shopping first.

31
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:28,954
             But, I brought
             stuff for Buckball-

32
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,190
Are we supposed to be
learning something here?

33
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,993
Cause this doesn't sound
like compromising at all.

34
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:38,897
Yeah! You guys have nothing in
common. How can you be friends?

35
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,108
      Even though Rainbow
        Dash and Rarity

36
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,743
 enjoy doing different things,

37
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,846
  there are plenty of reasons
     why they're friends.

38
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,450
    Uh, like what?

39
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:33,585
  Tch. We've <i>always</i> been friends!

40
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,954
                         Always?

41
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:40,125
  Well, no. Not<i> always.</i> But
  for like a super long time.

42
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,562
And we know all
the same ponies.

43
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,330
Um, is that it?

44
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,001
                 There was that time during the
                 Cloudsdale Best Young Flyer

45
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,272
                competition when I totally saved
              Rarity's life!

46
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,908
     Yes! And <i>I</i> once proved
    Rainbow Dash's innocence

47
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,443
   to her beloved Wonderbolts

48
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,446
   when she was being framed
   for a mysterious incident!

49
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,783
        Cool! What else?

50
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:06,394
Heh heh..

51
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,656
   Uh, look, it may seem like
    Rarity and Rainbow Dash

52
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,157
        don't have that
        much in common

53
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,026
      when you try to put
        it into words..

54
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:18,096
   But sometimes friendships
    can't be explained.

55
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,900
   You just have to see them
   in action to understand.

56
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,002
       Actually... that's
       a great idea!

57
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,876
   Just go about your Day of
   Fun as you normally would!

58
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,011
You won't even know we're here!

59
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,013
            Game On!

60
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:47,359
   Rarity! You were supposed
   to be holding your bucket!

61
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:52,197
Hmm? Oh, sorry, darling! Wearing
this drab jersey gave me an idea

62
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,167
    for a Buckball-inspired
   line of "athleisure wear"

63
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,537
  that would allow for maximum
  flexibility and style.

64
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,206
       But I'm ready now!

65
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,243
   Good. Cause this time I'm
    gonna try something new

66
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,979
       and super-intense!

67
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,957
      Rarity! Are you even
       paying attention?

68
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,962
 What? Oh, I mean, of course! I
 held my bucket and everything!

69
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:26,099
        But you have to
        CATCH the ball.

70
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,835
Really? Well, that
sounds dangerous.

71
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,573
      Oh, forget it. She's
     never gonna understand

72
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,141
    the point of this game.

73
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,843
     Buckball time is over!

74
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,579
Ah! Finally!

75
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,117
    Er.. see? They did something
     Rainbow Dash likes,

76
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,820
 so now it's time for something
 Rarity likes. Compromise!

77
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:56,595
  Hmmm. I'm genuinely not
  sure. Are they too in style?

78
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,765
Uh, isn't that what
you want them to be?

79
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,801
   Yes, yes. But they should
    be ahead of the curve.

80
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,403
         If they're in
       fashion right now,

81
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,472
     then they're
    practically already out!

82
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,207
  That doesn't make any sense.

83
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:12,611
      Hmm. Perhaps I should get
     the stilettos instead.

84
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,045
       What do you think?

85
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,382
Unless you like tripping
with every step,

86
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,386
heels on a horse
are pretty useless.

87
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:24,923
 [snort]<i> Au contraire!</i> They're perfect
 in a multitude of situations:

88
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,260
 Formal functions, afternoon
 teas, evening teas, high teas,

89
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,561
  tea by the sea, royal tea--

90
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,432
Can they clean up glitter?
Ew! It's on my hooves!

91
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,469
        Are we done yet?

92
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:38,738
          Agh!

93
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,108
This is <i>so</i> boring!

94
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,911
      Rainbow Dash and
       Rarity are just... er..

95
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,381
  showcasing an aspect of
  friendship called "banter":

96
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,651
    the playful and friendly
    exchange of remarks!

97
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,419
     It's all in good fun!

98
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:01,693
   Ooh I cannot wait! Collecting
   gemstones is my favorite.

99
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,197
  Finally, something we can
  agree on: treasure hunting!

100
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,372
     See, everycreature?
     That didn't take long.

101
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,508
      Now they're having a
      great time together.

102
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:21,747
Ooh<i> Magnifique!</i> This will
be perfect for the

103
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,383
emerald-encrusted romper
I've been working on.

104
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,918
            Cool! Now what would
            be even cooler

105
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,287
 is if we could find a treasure
  chamber or something.

106
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:35,094
    Now if I were a secret
    door, where would I be?

107
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:44,469
 Rainbow Dash! Could you please
 refrain from all of that racket?

108
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,438
        It's muddying my
         concentration.

109
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,708
        [gasp] Look! A lever!

110
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,445
        It's stuck. Come
        help me, Rarity!

111
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,948
     [sigh] Just a moment.

112
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:06,926
      [gasp] You<i> ruined</i> my gems!

113
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,795
     Yeah, well. <i>You</i> ruined
     my treasure hunt!

114
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,799
 Ugh. This wasn't about treasure!

115
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:17,068
 It was about finding gemstones
 for my winter collection.

116
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,187
Who cares about clothes!?

117
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,807
We're supposed to be on
an adventure together!

118
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:23,861
Uh oh.

119
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:29,080
   That. Is. It! This "Day of
    Fun" is officially OVER!

120
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,384
 Fine by ME! Maybe I can spend
 some time doing something

121
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,519
      I actually like now!

122
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,489
                  Er.. heh heh heh.

123
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,224
  Surely you don't mean that!

124
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,626
       You're just having
     a little.. disagreement!

125
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,263
 Sometimes that happens between
   pals. But no matter what,

126
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:48,667
  they can always get past the
 problem and stay good friends!

127
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,233
 I don't think we can.

128
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,572
    You don't care about any
     of the things I like!

129
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,984
   It's always about you
   and your boring fashions.

130
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,912
  Oh, Please!<i> You</i> don't even
  give my interests a chance!

131
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,615
 You have absolutely no
 respect for the finer things.

132
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,751
    NO RESPECT, I tell you!

133
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,654
       [both]
       I guess we're just
      NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE!

134
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:10,622
              Oh!

135
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,230
     And then there was the
     time Rainbow Dash

136
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,700
     called my Cloudsdale
     Couture Boutique idea

137
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,269
  "impractical"! Imagine that.

138
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,637
        Just because I'd
        needed Twilight

139
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,672
    to perform the Butterfly
    Wing spell on me

140
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,975
      whenever I wanted to
      deliver merchandise.

141
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:34,245
  And I told her a thousand
  times Pegasi don't even want

142
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,817
 restrictive, heavy dresses! We
  need to be able to fly. Duh.

143
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:43,054
 Not to mention the day I was
 wearing a<i> really</i> gorgeous hat

144
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,325
       and Rainbow Dash
      didn't even notice!

145
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,561
The Wonderbolts
show was RUINED!

146
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,332
   Rarity's hat was blocking
   everypony's view!

147
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:55,601
            ENOUGH!

148
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,637
   Guidance counseling is for
   talking out your problems,

149
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,572
   not telling me everything
    that's ever happened

150
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,240
  in the history of Equestria!

151
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,479
   But I've learned sometimes
     talking isn't enough.

152
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,014
   You need to put yourselves
    in one another's shoes.

153
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,719
   No way am I wearing those.

154
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,855
      [groan]
      What I'm saying is,

155
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:21,593
   we need a way to help you
   two reconnect. Follow me!

156
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:32,204
       The library? And
       this helps us how?

157
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,239
      You both love books!

158
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,576
 Rainbow Dash never
 stops talking about
Daring Do adventures.

159
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,279
    And you're a huge fan of
    Shadow Spade mysteries.

160
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,180
                Your point?

161
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,150
  The perfect way for you
  two to reconnect as friends

162
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,553
     is to read each
     other's favorite book.

163
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,256
 I'll read them, too! Then
  we'll all discuss afterward.

164
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,126
    It'll be a "Good
    Friends Book Club"! OK?

165
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:55,961
       I'll bring snacks..

166
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,463
                      Ugh, fine.

167
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,764
 If you insist.

168
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,770
   Great! We're all here! To
   start, why don't you two

169
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,573
   share one thing you liked
   about each other's books?

170
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:16,247
    OK, I'll go first! Erm.. I
   really enjoyed the part in

171
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,617
       "Daring Do and the
        Razor of Dreams"

172
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,586
   when Daring used a vicious
     Cragadile as a raft and then--

173
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,289
            Please!

174
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,424
            Uh, what's so funny?

175
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,528
Uh sorry, it's just that I
find those action sequences

176
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,030
so ridiculously
 over-the-top.

177
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,400
        But they're real.. you've
       even met Daring Do!

178
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,837
   Yes, but the book's
   descriptions just drag on.

179
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,407
 And what about all those
 silly, unpronounceable names?

180
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,175
   Doctor whozit, whatsit...

181
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,711
         Cab-a-YAIR-on?

182
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:52,251
   CAB-A-LER-ON! Just like it
   looks! How hard is that?

183
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,221
       Uh tea, anypony?
       Cucumber sandwich? Heh..

184
00:10:56,523 --> 00:11:00,159
 Or we could go over some nice,
 friendly talking points!

185
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,295
      Hah! Seriously? Don't
      even get me started

186
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,699
  on those clothing
 descriptions in Shadow Spade!

187
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,068
       What a yawn fest!

188
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,938
   B-But... the outfit
   descriptions are an integral part of the plot

189
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,576
    of "The Colt in Crimson:
    A Shadow Spade Mystery"!

190
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,815
   You see, if you
    didn't know

191
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,383
    that Sir Fluffingsworth
    von Radishfield

192
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,919
   wears only silk,
  double-breasted waistcoats,

193
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,223
you'd never deduce that
 he, in fact, was the culprit!

194
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,592
         Wait, he was?

195
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:37,596
[gasp] You didn't
even read it!

196
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,232
      I can see I'm gonna
      need reinforcements.

197
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,469
    Not my fault it's so
   boring it put me to sleep.

198
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,572
   If you can't be bothered
   to read the thing I like,

199
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,307
     that just further
     illustrates the point

200
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,376
      that we have nothing
       in common anymore!

201
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,914
      At least we agree on
       that! From now on,

202
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:59,350
     I'm only hanging out
   with ponies who "get" me.

203
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,756
    Your drama can wait!
   Twilight needs help, now!

204
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,862
           Any luck?

205
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,965
         No! It's GONE!

206
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,600
          What's gone?

207
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,436
     The Amulet of Aurora.

208
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,804
    Agh! One of the magical items
    you've been keeping

209
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,339
     for Princess Celestia?

210
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:25,009
  That amulet can reverse the
  tides and summon tsunamis!

211
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,945
      If it falls into the
      wrong hooves,

212
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,948
       Equestria will be
       in grave danger!

213
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,750
     Don't worry, Twilight!

214
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,351
  I know tons about searching
  for lost treasure!

215
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,087
      And if I follow the
       culprit's clues,

216
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,489
     I'm certain I can find
     who took your amulet!

217
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,860
      Thank you! I'll
      feel so much better

218
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:45,130
    knowing you two are
    looking for it.. together!

219
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,199
        While WE work on
        a locator spell!

220
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,801
   It's the perfect solution!

221
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,307
       There appear to be
       no signs of damage

222
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,309
       to the surrounding
         artifacts,

223
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,679
   suggesting the thief
   did not leave in a hurry.

224
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,688
 RARITY! Your boots are leaving
  sparkles all over the floor!

225
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:18,997
  Pfft. Those aren't from my
boots. Mine are magenta,
  not blue. See?

226
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,802
        I mean, really!

227
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,644
   Turns out these boots were
    not "made for trotting",

228
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:35,051
         as advertised.

229
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:35,775
               Uch!

230
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:41,286
Where are you going?
We promised Twilight we'd work together!

231
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,987
         Don't you see?

232
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,391
    The Amulet of Aurora is
    made out of Azurantium!

233
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,562
     Azurantium? You know,
     the same metal

234
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,897
  that the Amulet of Atonement

235
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,899
      from Daring Do Book
     4 is made from?

236
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,435
   It always leaves sparkles
   wherever it goes!

237
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:01,673
 Just like this. Remember? It's
  from the book you JUST READ?

238
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:08,313
[nervous chuckle]
That book yes. The one I - I just read. Heh.

239
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,184
Seriously? After giving
me all that grief,

240
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,487
you didn't read
mine either!?

241
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,056
                 Oopsie?

242
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:22,326
    Grrr. As soon as we find this
      amulet, we are DONE with each other!

243
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,430
          Fine by me!

244
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:36,485
         Oooh!

245
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,480
    Rainbow Dash, slow down!
     You're flying past important clues!

246
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,549
      It's a print, but
     definitely not a hoof.

247
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,351
     Are those claw marks?

248
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:49,554
       Who cares? I found
         a bigger clue.

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,493
             I hope you don't
              expect me to...

250
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,163
    [shudder] WADE through that.

251
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,273
      Nah, it's too deep.
       We'll get stuck.

252
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,676
  Ooh clever! What Daring Do book
   did you get that from?

253
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,345
   Actually, I learned it at
 Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp.

254
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,949
  Ach. At least you can fly across...

255
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,591
 Nope! If one of those geysers
  burns off my wingfeathers,

256
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,985
     I'll be out of the
     Wonderbolts for weeks.

257
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,364
   [sigh] I could try and
   slingshot my way through,

258
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,433
    but I'd need two
    perfectly placed trees,

259
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,835
      some stretchy rope,
      and a pith helmet.

260
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,038
        Hm..

261
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,539
       Too bad we can't
     do what Daring Do did

262
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,609
     in book 4 and find a
     Cragadile for a raft.

263
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:49,280
    Ta da! The SS Cragadile,
     at your service.

264
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,052
      Uh. That. Is... Awesome!

265
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,388
       I-I mean... it's all
        right. I guess.

266
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,560
How did you know
how to do that?

267
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:04,996
    Hm! We may have been friends
    "for a super long time",

268
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,565
     but you don't know
    EVERYTHING about me yet!

269
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,345
 [gasp] The glitter trail! It's gone!

270
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,915
How are we supposed to find
the Amulet of Aurora now!?

271
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:36,294
    [very quietly] Ow, ears!
    Why hoof-hoofs yell?

272
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,930
                Too-too loud.

273
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,334
Sorry, what did you say?

274
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,004
         Too-too loud.

275
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,975
 I think it's a Bufogren! They
  have really sensitive ears.

276
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,443
       [whispering] Did you happen to
        see anycreature

277
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,080
      with a sparkly
      thingy go this way?

278
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,215
            Saw it.

279
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,251
          Gah!

280
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:00,918
       Hold that thought.

281
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,161
      His breath smells so
      bad I can't think!

282
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:14,465
   But we can't hear him
   from back here. Now what?

283
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,401
              Hmm.

284
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:24,275
    Aha! I think I have
     the perfect solution.

285
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,246
  An old unicorn beauty trick.
  That is, if you can somehow

286
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,048
       procure us a tiny
       bit of cloud?

287
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,782
Now that! I can do!

288
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:40,091
       Oooh! It's adorable!

289
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,067
[nasal] Uh. Excuse me, kind sir.

290
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,502
I have a special
treat for you

291
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,938
in exchange
for your information.

292
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:58,010
          Uhm. What's that?

293
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,413
It is a magical
Unicorn delicacy

294
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,282
    called "Effervescence".

295
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,851
      Very now, very chic.

296
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,687
             Ooow!

297
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,789
      Sorry. Sorry. Enjoy!

298
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:18,763
Mmmmm. Mm.
Muh mouth. Fresh and minty.

299
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:28,073
    Ah! Good! Now which way did
     the sparkly thing go?

300
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,443
        Up-up! Up there.

301
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:32,844
Thank you!

302
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,281
      Well, what are you
      waiting for? Go on!

303
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,285
        Fly up there and
        get that amulet!

304
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:43,087
Uh.. we're doing this
together, remember?

305
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,889
      But how can we? Oh!

306
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:53,064
Sorry, but I wasn't leaving
you behind in that swamp.

307
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,434
                   [gasp] Thank you.

308
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,542
      Huh... maybe the key to
      unlocking this thing

309
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,911
   is in these inscriptions.

310
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,214
              Or.. perhaps the
              key is right here!

311
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,319
  I couldn't decide between
  the boots and the stilettos,

312
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,421
         so I got both.

313
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,734
High heels can
  do that!?

314
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,795
                  And you called
                   them useless..

315
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:27,698
I shouldn't have said that. Or
made fun of the other stuff

316
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,269
you like to do. Some of
it's actually sorta neat.

317
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,572
   I owe you an apology, too.

318
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,843
 Buckball may not be my thing,
 but it's something you enjoy.

319
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,745
  And you're very good at it!

320
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,713
      I never should have
     treated your interests

321
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,716
      like they were worth
        less than mine.

322
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:49,154
So... does this mean
we're still friends?

323
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,590
                 I would very
                 much like that.

324
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,692
               Now let's go find
               that amulet!

325
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,627
Yeah! Ha ha!

326
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,668
       Wait. That tunnel
      leads to the SCHOOL?

327
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,071
       A secret passage!
        AWESOME!

328
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:13,478
  [gasp] Spikey-Wikey, you
  stole the Amulet of Aurora!?

329
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,580
    Twilight: Not exactly.

330
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:22,320
   You mean... this was a
  setup to make us get along?

331
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,656
Sorry to interfere,
but you both--

332
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,326
Reaaally needed it.

333
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,199
 So even though you don't like
  any of the same stuff,

334
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,102
   you two are friends again?

335
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:42,607
      Heh. Always. I think we just
       needed a teensy reminder.

336
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,776
      Yeah. We don't have to
      love the exact same things

337
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,147
   to have fun together. I
    mean, imagine if we did!

338
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,349
   How boring would that be?

339
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,285
When we give each other
 a chance to share the
 different things

340
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:57,823
    we enjoy, it can be
    surprisingly wonderful!

341
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:01,326
       Ah. Too bad we wasted
        our Day of Fun.

342
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,327
        We still have a
       little time left!

343
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,563
 You wanna... go hit the shops?

344
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,731
        I could actually
       use your help

345
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,566
       picking out some
       new Buckball gear!

346
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:09,567
             DO I?

347
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,571
 But... only if you help me choose
  some Buckball fan attire,

348
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,573
       so I can cheer for
       my favorite player

349
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,608
 at the drop of a fabulous hat.

350
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,444
  Uh, YEAH! Let's go already!

351
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,885
 See? Good friends always work
  through their differences.

352
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:30,354
        [chuckle] Even if it takes
         a little help.
