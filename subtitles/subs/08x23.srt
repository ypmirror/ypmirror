1
00:00:01,934 --> 00:00:03,435
    Twilight: I can't believe
     you two are going

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:04,803
     on a Friendship Quest!

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,338
        This is amazing!

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,607
What do ya mean, Twilight?

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,442
We've been on one
together before.

6
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:11,610
            Exactly!

7
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,212
     This is the first time
      the map has teamed up

8
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:15,381
       the same ponies for
       a second quest!

9
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,817
That <i>is</i> special!

10
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:22,354
 Heh. Must be 'cause we're extra good
 at solvin' friendship problems.

11
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,422
      Twilight: I hope so.

12
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,258
  Cause it looks like this one
    might be a little tricky.

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,028
You're going to
the Peaks of Peril.

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,032
    The... Peaks of... P-P-P-Peril!?

15
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,800
      Aw, it's just a name.

16
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,135
    It doesn't mean anything.

17
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,204
Like how Cloudsdale
is in the clouds,

18
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,307
and the Crystal Empire
is made of crystal?

19
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,509
                    Fair point.

20
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:46,278
  So what can you tell us
   about the place, Twilight?

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,846
   Only what Rockhoof told me.

22
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:51,216
Back in his day, nopony knew
 much about the Peaks of Peril.

23
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,986
    Except for the legend on
    this ancient shield.

24
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,955
   It says a group called the
    Kirin used to live there,

25
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,591
    known for their kindness
    and truth-speaking.

26
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,094
      Now we know why
       the map called us.

27
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,731
     Unfortunately, other
     creatures also lived there.

28
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,335
   The Nirik. Fearsome beasts
      of pure fire.

29
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:14,005
[shudder] Maybe...you should go
instead of me, Twilight.

30
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,508
       Sorry, Fluttershy.

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,843
        Flanks don't lie.

32
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:22,047
  Aw, I'm sure the two of us'll
   get that friendship problem

33
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,683
     solved, no matter what
    kinda creature has it.

34
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:18,304
   Guess nopony else is goin'
   out as far as we are.

35
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,840
      Maybe they know
       something we don't..

36
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:24,076
Now Fluttershy, I've
told you a dozen times!

37
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,010
There's nothing
to be scared--

38
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,281
      [old pony's voice]
       I'm sorry.

39
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,220
     You really startled us!

40
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:38,023
Oh it's just that I'm not
used to seeing anypony

41
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:42,394
taking the train to...
the end of the line.

42
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,197
 [ominous]
The final destination.

43
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,833
         The last stop!

44
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,003
        We get the picture. Why?

45
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:56,775
  Nothing but uncharted terrain
  and wild beasts out that way...

46
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,092
  Well, maybe there's a little
   somethin' to be scared of.

47
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:16,628
             Eeyah!

48
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,671
              Agh!

49
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,080
               Those must be the
               Peaks of Peril. Phew.

50
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,016
    Tough goin', huh
     Fluttersh-- Fluttershy?

51
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:40,853
              Agh!

52
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:46,992
               Oh!

53
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,937
There. That should be enough
flowers to keep your tree cozy.

54
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,341
           Fluttershy!

55
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,176
       What are you doin'!?

56
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,679
             This is no time for
             visitin' varmints!

57
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,014
           We're on a friendship
           quest, remember?

58
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,783
        Yes, but actual--
         -Come on!

59
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,319
     We're burnin' daylight!

60
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,255
       I know, but what I
       found out is that--

61
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,957
 Now, we gotta get up that peak.

62
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:20,325
         I figure if we use some
         rope and elbow grease,

63
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,127
        we can make it up half--

64
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,896
APPLEJACK! CAN YOU
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME?

65
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:27,499
         [Ahem] What I'm
        trying to say is,

66
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,434
      the squirrels told me
      a short cut they take

67
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,769
      to the Kirin village.

68
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,112
       Oh. Heh heh.
       Sorry, Fluttershy.

69
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:43,182
   I s'pose I got a little too
   caught up in the adventure.

70
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:44,750
        That's all right.

71
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,752
       If you hadn't come
         back to get me,

72
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,488
   I probably would've talked
    to the squirrels all day!

73
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,698
   [rustling]
I hope that's not a Nirik..

74
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,806
         Show yourself!

75
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,851
            Well, hi!

76
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,386
     I'm Applejack, and this
       here is Fluttershy.

77
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,695
  If you have any friendship
  problems, we're here to help!

78
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,170
Huh. Quiet bunch,
ain't they?

79
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,372
      We're from Equestria.

80
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,708
     And we're plum-tickled
     to meet y'all.

81
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,445
             S-So...

82
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,447
      What are <i>your</i> names?

83
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:55,955
       APPLEJACK.
      FLUTTERSHY. Remember?

84
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,657
                Maybe they don't
                understand us.

85
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,392
               Do.

86
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,326
              You.

87
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,861
           Understand.

88
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,062
             Ponish?

89
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,968
                    Oh! But you
                    don't speak?

90
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,073
         Don't or won't?

91
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,408
                Will you excuse
                us for a moment?

92
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:22,748
You have to ask "yes or no"
questions, or they won't answer.

93
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,683
Like talkin' to
Angel bunny?

94
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,085
                   Not exactly.

95
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,454
I can always tell
what Angel is feeling.

96
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,957
But these Kirin,
don't show anything.

97
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,160
  Well, how are we gonna
   solve a friendship problem

98
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,597
       if none of 'em will
       tell us what it IS?

99
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,513
 These Kirin are quieter than
  an apple blossom on snowfall!

100
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,249
  Still. There's gotta be some
   way to make 'em speak.

101
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:03,588
Heh heh. Beautiful day,
ain't it?

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,260
          Knock knock!

103
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,929
   Now you say "who's there?"

104
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,099
             Police!

105
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,667
                  Police who?

106
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,169
      POLICE say somethin'?

107
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:26,544
         Uh oh. I feel a
        sneeze comin' on!

108
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,980
            ACHOOOO!

109
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,850
                     Fluttershy:
                     Gesundheit!

110
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,118
              Ugh!

111
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,620
    Don't ANY of y'all talk?

112
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,428
  Now we're gettin' somewhere!

113
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,931
  A dark spooky path that
  leads into unknown territory!?

114
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,199
Tell ya what,
sugarcube.

115
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,068
You stay and see if
you can get anything

116
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,302
out of these here Kirin.

117
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,405
I'll go try to find
one that talks.

118
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,309
           Phew! Be careful! And
           watch out for Niriks!

119
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:12,724
             Aaaah!

120
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,094
             Phew...

121
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:17,963
                        Aaah!

122
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,965
       Oh! Have you seen a
       Kirin that talks?

123
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:25,203
                  Any idea where
                  I should look?

124
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:29,441
                Oh, for the love
                of Celestia!

125
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,242
                  Can't you just
                  say SOMETHIN'?

126
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,846
[laugh] Gotcha!

127
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,915
Sorry, sorry but
that was too good.

128
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,683
Oh, you don't know
how much I miss jokes.

129
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,952
HI-larity! Am I
pronouncing that right?

130
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,722
Some words I haven't said
in a wil.. While.. While.

131
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,091
Hi, I'm Autumn Blaze.

132
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:48,193
You've just arrived and perhaps
you're tired or hungry,

133
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,629
or reflective, and want to
sleep and eat and journal?

134
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,998
      Which you should do! Of
      course. But first, OH! OH!

135
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,534
  What joy to talk with another
  creature, it's been so long!

136
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,235
           You must tell me
           everything about you;

137
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,737
             there's so much to
             say, so much to DO!

138
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,772
Oh, look at me, I'm going
on and you haven't seen--

139
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,758
I mean have you seen--?
What am I saying?

140
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:04,543
Of course, you haven't,
you just so I will-

141
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,444
           Follow me.

142
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,114
 That was somethin', all right.

143
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,557
                        Oh, wow!

144
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,159
This.. is amazing!

145
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,895
      Oh, you think so too?

146
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,730
   The way the light shimmers
     off everything like...

147
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,866
    like it all suddenly woke
    up the moment you saw it,

148
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:31,136
and you realize maybe the water
and the mountains and the forest

149
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,772
    and the, yes the rainbow
    and the stars and the sky

150
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,341
   are all looking back at you
    thinking the same thing?

151
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,677
       That we are a part
       of the everything.

152
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,148
   That maybe there's just one
  thing, and we are all it!

153
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,319
I was gonna say "it's
pretty," but yeah.

154
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,055
Ha ha ha! [sniff] Mmmmm.

155
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,857
      And this is just the
     first stop on a journey

156
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,059
    of amazing things to see,
     smell, tiptoe through!

157
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:57,062
Oh I haven't been able to share all
of this with anypony in forever,

158
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,964
       since they all took
      that vow of silence,

159
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,868
  so it's a lot for me to, you
    know, PROcess. Pro-CESS.

160
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,970
           Er. Deal with.

161
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,939
                 Whoa, there...
                 Vow of silence?

162
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,509
    That's uh, that's why
     they asked me to leave.

163
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:14,112
 I hope it's not a sore subject,
 but you mind explaining

164
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,715
            why y'all went quiet
            in the first place?

165
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,484
It's a long story.

166
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,620
               [sigh] You'd rather not
                talk about it?

167
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,722
               No.
           -I under--

       That's what I said!

00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,125
     Y'know, when I
     started talking again.

231
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,695

  that Fluttershy and I

232
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,096
    came to help y'all with!

233
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,598
    Really? Who's Fluttershy?

234
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,333
  Oh, did you name your shadow!?

235
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,403
   Mine's called Silhouette
   Gloom of the Sundown Lands.

236
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,905
Riiiight...

237
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,075
Well, I'm thinking if we just
go talk to the other Kirin,

238
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,511
we can get 'em to welcome
you back proper-like.

239
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,013
Maybe even convince
'em to take your cure!

240
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,116
          Oh, Yes, Yes
           of course!

241
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,618
          Oh.. Just one
          small thing.

242
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,586
        The antidote from
        my anecdote?

243
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,721
           It's gone.

244
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,723
There's no cure left!?

245
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,893
  I used the last of the Foal's
  Breath flowers to make it.

246
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,029
       And I haven't seen
        them bloom since.

247
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:28,132
Huh. Well, this wouldn't be a
Friendship Quest if it was easy!

248
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,636
I'm gonna start by gettin' your
friends to welcome you back.

249
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,507
  You know? Between you and me,

250
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,909
     I'm not sure she's
     going to convince them.

251
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,178
              "Nope."

252
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,380
     But... I hope she does.

253
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,155
    [panting] Fluttershy, guess what!

254
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,590
     Both: I figured out the
    friendship problem!

255
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,558
             Me too.

256
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,726
            Go ahead.

257
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,496
Bet that's a problem
the Kirin never have.

258
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,664
                 [giggle] No.

259
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,866
Anyhow, we gotta get
'em all talkin' again.

260
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,701
       Oh, no-no-no-no-no!

261
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,771
 We can't EVER let that happen!

262
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,740
I thought you said you figured
out the friendship problem!

263
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,608
Was somethin' lost
in translation?

264
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,814
      The Kirin are usually
       peaceful and kind.

265
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,551
     But when they get mad,
     they turn into Niriks,

266
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,621
      creatures made of
       fire and vengeance!

267
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,124
     That seemed less scary
     when it was in a song.

268
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,994
   The last time they all
   argued, they got so angry,

269
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,797
   they accidentally destroyed
    their whole village!

270
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,999
      So the Kirin decided
       to make sure

271
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,068
  it would never happen again.

272
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,537
      But that's no reason
      to stop talkin'!

273
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,872
           Yes it is!

274
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,307
       Fire is dangerous.

275
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,743
        Especially in a
        forest like this!

276
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,078
     Think of all the
     animals it could hurt!

277
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,514
     Not if they don't turn
    into fire-breathin' Nirik

278
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,882
       in the first place!

279
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,418
     And how can you be
     sure that won't happen?

280
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,019
        There's gotta be
        a better way

281
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,788
       than givin' up all
       your feelings!

282
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,922
           APPLEJACK!

283
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,690
      You're not LISTENING!

284
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,293
       Cause you're not
       TALKIN' any sense!

285
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,897
      Um, what
      are they doing?

286
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,498
                  Woah! Hey!

287
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,868
Maybe they got worried because
we were arguing with each other.

288
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,903
           Aw, shucks.

289
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,273
    We were just havin' a
   normal, civil disagreement.

290
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,307
             Honest!

291
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,209
    Where are they taking us!?

292
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,348
    To the Stream of Silence!

293
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,716
   If we hit that water, we'll
   never be able to talk

294
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,286
  or FEEL anything ever again!

295
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,189
 [evil voice]                  
PUT THEM DOWN!

296
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,898
It's all right, I
think I know this one.

297
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,066
And she's tryin' to help.

298
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,703
[whoosh] Well, yeah!

299
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:47,405
 Can't have them silence the
 only friend who'll speak to me.

300
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:48,973
           She talks!?

301
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,610
You have <i>no </i>idea.

302
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:54,279
 Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.

303
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,719
             Thank you for that,
             um, wall of fire.

304
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,855
   But.. I thought Niriks were
   dangerous when they're angry.

305
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,324
      How did you know you could
      control your temper?

306
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,794
I didn't. I guess anger's
like other feelings.

307
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,331
It's not about having them,
it's what you do with them.

308
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:16,835
 And giving up happiness to keep
 away anger is no kinda life.

309
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,603
                 I never thought
                 of it that way.

310
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,508
 I can't imagine not being able
to talk to my animal friends.

311
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,204
  Fern Flare, you used to
  love to laugh at everything.

312
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,547
  And Rain Shine, you sung the
  most beautiful harmonies.

313
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,682
       Don't you miss it?

314
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,518
      I know you're worried
       about fightin'.

315
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,487
    But friends can disagree
    without causin' a ruckus.

316
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,656
 Every pony gets mad sometimes.

317
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,758
   Even Applejack and I argue.

318
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,195
What? When do
we ever argue?

319
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,096
     Ahem. On the way here!

320
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,131
       And about the
       Kirin being silent!

321
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,833
         And RIGHT NOW!

322
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,339
    [chuckle] We don't
     always see eye-to-eye.

323
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,709
  But we never let that get in
   the way of our friendship.

324
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,279
   And if you're really angry,
    then take some time away

325
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,915
     to be a Nirik where it
       won't hurt anypony.

326
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,455
I think they're tryin'
to say somethin'.

327
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,423
OK. Are you hungry?

328
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,594
        Oh, no! Somekirin
       trapped in a well?

329
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,061
OK, Baby?

330
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:17,996
Baby fish?

331
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,998
Baby- Baby fish mouth?

332
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,999
Something? Anything?

333
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,368
Ah just write it down!

334
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,136
Ugh! This is making me furious!

335
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,004
Would you excuse me?

336
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,572
I'll be right back.

337
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,809
[roar]

338
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,545
You were saying.

339
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,619
    Oh! You want the cure for
    the Stream of Silence!

340
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,990
That's wonderful!

341
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,225
Uh, isn't it?

342
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,760
Well, it would be.

343
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,663
Except there aren't any
flowers left to make the cure.

344
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,498
Are you sure?

345
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,966
        Oh, beyond sure.

346
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,168
    Believe me, I've had a
    lot of alone time lately.

347
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,739
 I searched the entire forest
 seventy three and a half times.

348
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:05,009
Although I wonder if that second
 half could make a difference..

349
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:11,850
Hm. I wish she'd told us what kind
of flowers she's looking for.

350
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,318
  They're called Foal's Breath.

351
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,886
    I've never heard of that.

352
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,394
         Uh Fluttershy?
         A little help?

353
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,166
[gasp] He says he knows where
to find Foals Breath!

354
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,134
         Well, what are
         we waitin' for?

355
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,335
          Lead the way!

356
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,611
              [gasp] THAT's what Foal's
              Breath looks like!?

357
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,113
Autumn Blaze never would have
made it past the Peaks

358
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,149
to search here!

359
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,285
      I owe you an apology.

360
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:47,286
       Why?

361
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,088
 'Cause if your kindness hadn't
  made you stop to help

362
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,358
the squirrels, we never would've
 found this here flower.

363
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,295
   And if your honesty hadn't
  convinced the Kirin to talk,

364
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,297
  we wouldn't NEED to find it.

365
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,300
 Heh heh. Guess it's a good
 thing the map sent both of us, huh?

366
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,408
         [gasp] You found them!
        Where were they?

367
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,710
     Tell me everything, and
     feel free to add

368
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,846
    complicated descriptions
    and comedic tangents.

369
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,184
 Oh, right. First things first.

370
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,971
           Autumn Blaze, you
           have given us a gift:

371
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,141
            the realization that
            anger is within us.

372
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,477
            But it is our choice
            how we let it out.

373
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,448
  We would very much like it if
  you came back to live with us.

374
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,919
    I can't say how much we've
    missed your beautiful voice.
