00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,246
  Let us hope the three of you
  will be enough for my plans.

429
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,482
        And what of King Sombra?

430
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,318
Did he succeed?

431
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,519
               HA!

432
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,686
            [zapping]

433
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,363
  I'd say he gambled and lost.

434
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,465
       But at least he can
       serve as a warning

435
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,568
    to those who doubt
    continuing with my plans.

436
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,972
 Unless any of you have doubts...

437
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,906
             Uh. Not I.

438
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:16,607
               No!

439
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,442
            I'm good.

440
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,678
   Then we shall join
    forces and work together

441
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,481
       to bring Equestria
       to its knees!

442
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,651
         [evil laughter]

443
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:31,775
         [all laughing]
