1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:06,105
   I can't believe we're going
  to the Appleoosa County Fair!

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,208
     Animal shows,
     carnival rides...

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,043
And all kinds of
food on a stick!

4
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,946
    Speaking of food, did you
   pack snacks for the train?

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,182
       For there AND back.

6
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,584
     And our train
     tickets are all set.

7
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,991
     And I've got our whole
     itinerary planned!

8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,927
     Are you sure you're
     not <i>Twilight's</i> sister?

9
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,065
     Weeks of planning has
     all come down to this.

10
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,867
 All we have to do now is wait
 for our chaperone to get here.

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,002
             Mm hm!

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:42,074
  <i> ♪ [musical clock ticking] ♪</i>

13
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,075
        So when's Rainbow
        Dash coming?

14
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,445
I thought you were
gonna ask Applejack.

15
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,215
               I don't suppose
               you asked Rarity?

16
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:52,184
    You mean we spent all
    this time planning a trip

17
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,487
      and none of us asked
      anypony to take us!?

18
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,790
      In our defense, every
     <i>other</i> part of the trip

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,525
    was planned really well...

20
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,402
       We really did think
       of everything,

21
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,537
        except finding
       somepony to take us

22
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,172
         and the fair is
         only today!

23
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,642
   I'm sorry, darlings, but I
 can't possibly go to Appleoosa.

24
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,445
   I promised to deliver a new
  design to Fancy Pants for his

25
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:56,281
   Monocle and Top Hat
  Appreciation Society Soiree.

26
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,451
Can't you finish
it tomorrow?

27
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,021
    Well, I could, but you'll
    learn as you get older

28
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,823
     how important it is to
     keep your promises,

29
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,025
       especially when
       running a business.

30
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,195
      Maybe we should just
       go by ourselves?

31
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,997
          WHAT? Oh, my dear, no!

32
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,633
   Appleoosa is far too long a
   train ride for young foals

33
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,135
     without accompaniment!

34
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,337
     You could end up in the
      wrong place entirely.

35
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,372
      Why don't you see if
      Rainbow Dash is free?

36
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,309
  Sorry, but I just heard from
 Spitfire that a whole bunch of

37
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,278
     storm clouds got loose
     from the cloud factory

38
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,614
     and she needs every
  Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.

39
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,884
    Aw, come on Rainbow Dash,
    they won't miss ONE pony

40
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,754
       and we really want
       to go to the fair!

41
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,724
      Apparently, we're too
       young to go alone..

42
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,626
           Well, duh.

43
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,828
Young ponies like
you could get lost

44
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,396
and never find
your way back,

45
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,031
but I still can't go.

46
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,334
Being a Wonderbolt isn't
<i>just</i> about showing off,

47
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,170
it's also a
responsibility.

48
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,871
You'll understand
when you get older.

49
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,407
   I'm sure you'll find
   somepony else to take you.

50
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,878
   I wish I could, sugarcube.

51
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,980
       But Big Mac's not
       feeling well today.

52
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,182
              Aww!

53
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,917
    But Big Mac's old enough
    to take care of <i>himself</i>

54
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,120
      and we'd all have so
       much fun together..

55
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,390
        Sometimes taking
        care of somepony

56
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,291
        is more important
        than having fun.

57
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,263
    Speaking of which, don't
    you even THINK about

58
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,166
 trying to go without a grown
 pony there to take care of YOU.

59
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,236
      You could end up in
      hot water, or worse.

60
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,872
            We know...

61
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,941
  The fair could be over before
  we find somepony to take us!

62
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,710
   But then we thought of YOU!

63
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,979
      Since the fair will
      be full of all sorts

64
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,982
    of animals and creatures....!

65
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:39,484
     I'm sorry, but Twilight
      has an important

66
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,821
  magical research project and
  she's asked for my help.

67
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,858
      I guess that means
      Twilight's busy too?

68
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,361
  I'm afraid I am. Starswirl
  sent me this enchanted flower

69
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,896
    and it isn't doing well.

70
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,964
       If I figure out its
       magical properties,

71
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,299
      maybe we can save it.

72
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,236
    So that's a "no" on going
    with us to the fair?

73
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,439
    We've already asked
    Applejack, Rainbow Dash,

74
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,208
       and Rarity and none
       of them can come!

75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,143
          And everypony
          made it clear

76
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,512
        we're too young
        to go on our own...

77
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,147
         Oh, definitely.

78
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,850
    You could take the wrong
    train or miss your stop...

79
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,985
      Or get lost in a
     strange town and end up

80
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,088
    in a dangerous situation
    with nopony to help you!

81
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,590
            We know!

82
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,692
        I know it's hard,
        but sometimes

83
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,294
        you just can't do
        what you want.

84
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:25,931
  I'm pretty sure if YOU wanted
  to go to the fair you could...

85
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,500
   Sure, grownups can do a lot
   of things that foals can't,

86
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,569
       but there's plenty
       we can't do either.

87
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,871
     Like right now, I can't
     find a SINGLE reference

88
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,140
         to this flower!

89
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,675
      None of the birds or
     insects I've talked to

90
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,277
    have heard of it either.

91
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,178
  I wonder if there's anything
  in Shadetail Evergreen's

92
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,847
    Tome of Flora and Fauna?

93
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,749
       That book's <i>pretty</i>
        out of date,

94
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,750
         but it might be
          worth a try.

95
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,519
    I think there's a copy in
     the library filed under

96
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,054
     "Discontinued But Still
       Potentially Useful

97
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,289
         Ancient Texts."

98
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,424
    Unless I put it under
   "Hokum With A Slight Chance

99
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,692
   of Practical Applications."

100
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,196
     I guess this flower is
   the most interesting thing

101
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,531
     we're gonna see today..

102
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,500
  Unless you count watching
  Twilight struggle to remember

103
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,569
  how she organizes her books.

104
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:09,007
  I bet every pony in Equestria
   is in Appleoosa right now!

105
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,209
Every pony but US.

106
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,813
I wish we didn't have
to wait to grow up.

107
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,949
I wish it would
happen all at once.

108
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,785
Then we'd know everything
we'd need to get to the fair

109
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,788
and back with no problem.

110
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,425
          I just wish we were
          as old as our sisters!

111
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,760
       Then nopony could
       tell us what to do,

112
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,895
       and we'd be able to
     take care of ourselves!
