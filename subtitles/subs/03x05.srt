1
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,440
May I help you, traveler?

2
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,450
Something drew you to my shop...

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,040
something powerful.

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,240
Ah, you have a keen eye.

5
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,490
The Alicorn Amulet
is one of the most mysterious

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,340
and powerful
of all the known magical charms.

7
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,460
I'm afraid this is...
far too dangerous.

8
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,300
Would you like that gift-wrapped?

12
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,970
Don't be scared, little friends.
Twilight is wonderful with magic.

13
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,720
Anything happens to them, Twilight,
so help me.

14
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,550
Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy,

15
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,970
Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better
since she accidentally

16
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,160
crushed me and Applejack
with a giant snowball.

17
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,950
Of course she's good with magic.
Twilight's great with magic.

18
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,330
I guess I just don't want
my little friends to be scared...

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,690
Oh, oh, look how scared they are!

20
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,920
I promise, Fluttershy,
nothing bad will happen to them.

21
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,550
I know!

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,270
Stop, stop!
They can't take it!

23
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,160
Twilight, that looks amazing!

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,460
That's all for now, little ones.

25
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,170
Maybe we can practice again later,
if Fluttershy says it's alright.

26
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,200
Your magic has really improved
since we came to Ponyville, Twilight.

27
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,960
- Princess Celestia's gonna love it!
- Thanks, Spike.

28
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,430
I have to be at my best when she arrives
with the delegates from Saddle Arabia.

29
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,370
I can't believe she's trusting me
with the entertainment.

30
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,260
Twilight! Come quick!
It's an emergency!

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,550
You beast! This shade of brown
should only be used for accents!

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,520
Come on, Applejack. We've got
to get her into a nice, soothing pink.

33
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,550
STAT!

34
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,900
- What's going on here?
- Well, well, well.

35
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,930
If it isn't...
Twilight Sparkle.

36
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,560
- Trixie!
- What's she doing here?

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,090
You call that great and powerful?

38
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,400
- Oh! She's Rainbow Wobble, now!
- Yeah!

39
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,540
Good spell,
oh Great and Powerful Trixie!

40
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,540
You two! Quiet!

41
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,390
- What happened?
- Get off of me!

42
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,080
Stop picking on my friends, Trixie!

43
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,380
You and I
have some unfinished business.

44
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,350
My magic's gotten better
since I was here last.

45
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,360
And I'm going to prove it!

46
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,220
Me and you.
A magic duel.

47
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,400
Winner stays,
loser leaves Ponyville forever!

48
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,520
Forget it!
I'd never make a deal like that!

49
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:25,910
Your choice.

50
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,450
Trixie, put him down.

51
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,470
Why are you doing this?

52
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,950
Why?
Because you humiliated me!

53
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,760
After you showed me up
with that Ursa Minor,

54
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,270
I became a laughingstock!

55
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,260
Everywhere I went
I was laughed at and ostracized.

56
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,760
I even had to take a job on a rock farm
just to earn a living!

57
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,170
A rock farm!

58
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,750
Hey! You're lucky a rock farm
would take the likes of you!

59
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,930
Now I want revenge!

60
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,070
And I'll just keep casting spells
'til you agree.

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,580
Well?
What do you say?

62
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,710
Alright, Trixie.
Let's duel!

63
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,550
Excellent!

64
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,930
If I lose,
I won't set hoof in Ponyville again.

65
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,480
But if you lose, you're the one
banished from this one-horse town!

66
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,840
Draw!

67
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,530
Snips, Snails, step forward!

68
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,540
What is it,
oh Great and P-P-Powerful Trixie ?

69
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,970
An age spell?
But, how could you do an age spell?

70
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,490
That's only for
the highest level unicorns!

71
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,140
Well, Twilight?
Give up?

72
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,730
Come on, Twilight.
You can do it!

73
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,630
Trixie is the highest level unicorn!

74
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,670
And now it's time for you
to leave Ponyville!

75
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,550
FOREVER!

76
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,340
That's enough, Trixie!

77
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,770
You proved your point,

78
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,770
but you can't possibly
expect Twilight to leave Ponyville!

79
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,720
You fools.

80
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,110
She's already gone.

81
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,400
It's okay guys.
I'll figure something out.

82
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,020
Just take care of each other.
And keep an eye on Trixie.

83
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,150
There's something strange about her...

84
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,000
Twilight?

85
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,210
It's impossible!

86
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,790
How could Trixie know
such advanced magic?

87
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,640
Without Spike, I can't get a message
to the Princess in Saddle Arabia,

88
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,390
so who else do I know who understands
strange and powerful magic?

89
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,430
Your tale of woe upsets me so.

90
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,870
No wonder you're dour,
it's an abuse of power!

91
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,890
I don't know what to do, Zecora.
I feel like I've abandoned my friends.

92
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,880
But I can't take her on horn-to-horn.

93
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,570
If you train with me,
so good you'll be,

94
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,010
I'll show you the way
to make sure she won't stay.

95
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,940
You'll train me in magic?

96
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,270
But she was doing age spells,
weather spells, you name it!

97
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,590
When it comes to magic,
it would be tragic

98
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,580
if somepony licked me,
especially Trixie.

99
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,490
You really think I can beat her?

100
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,510
Okay, when do we start?

101
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,500
You two!
Hurry up with my throne.

102
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,840
And you, how long do I have to wait
for my apple sauce facial?

103
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,470
Forget it, Trixie.

104
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,830
I ain't doing nothin'
'til you let Twilight come home.

105
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,760
Okay, I'll do it, just make it stop!

106
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,340
I thought I told you to dance!

107
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,710
Trixie's cruel magic
is ruining Ponyville.

108
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,870
Somepony has to help us!

109
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,380
No noise, no sound,
no din, no fuss,

110
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,400
must interfere with your focus.

111
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,930
Unlearn what you have learned,
only then can victory be earned.

112
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,940
<i>Trixie is the highest level unicorn!</i>

113
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,340
There is much,
much that I can teach,

114
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,830
but the answer you need
may still be out of reach.

115
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm sorry, Zecora.

116
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm trying my best, but...
I can't stop thinking about Trixie.

117
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,680
There was something different
about her.

118
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,800
It's like she's gone
from high and mighty to mean and nasty.

119
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,060
Your thinking needs a readjust.
Total concentration is a must.

120
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,790
This really doesn't seem
to be getting us anywhere.

121
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,260
I hear you, Pinkie.

122
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,550
I can't find anything that describes
the kind of magic Trixie's doin'.

123
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,880
There must be something!
Twilight has every magic book there is!

124
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,070
Um, I think I may have found something?

125
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,010
Yes, it's time for us
to consider our futures

126
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,490
in this new Trixie-led Ponyville.

127
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,030
Um, this sounds an awful lot like
Trixie's magic--

128
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,570
She wants me to grow apples
with no peels!

129
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,780
How the hay am
I supposed to do that?

130
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,130
Um, there's a picture here
of that necklace--

131
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,120
It's called the Alicorn Amulet,

132
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,840
and whoever wears it
is blessed with untold--

133
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,240
Hey, everypony, look!

134
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,240
This book has a picture
of Trixie's necklace!

135
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,430
It's called the Alicorn Amulet,

136
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,540
and whoever wears it
is blessed with untold powers!

137
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,500
If you read a little further,
you'll see--

138
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,070
Even though it provides great power,
it also corrupts the user!

139
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,510
Yes, but, um, you can't--

140
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,970
You can't just
take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck.

141
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,730
It has a magical lock!
Trixie's the only pony who can take it off!

142
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,460
Maybe--

143
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,790
We need to get
this information to Twilight.

144
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,670
- She'll know what to do.
- But, how--

145
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,760
If any of us try to leave,
Trixie's magical forcefield will tell her!

146
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,860
- Maybe we should--
- I've got it!

147
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,140
Trying to sneak past the forcefield
would be impossible without help.

148
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,400
But I know who's got the goods
to get into those woods!

149
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,820
- Fluttershy!
-What?!

150
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,950
What do you say, Fluttershy?
Can you handle the mission?

151
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,490
No! I'll crack under the pressure,
I'll snap like a twig!

152
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,240
Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak out
of Ponyville and find Twilight.

153
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,030
But I-- I--

154
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,550
Okay.

155
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,790
I know just the design
for a dangerous mission outfit!

156
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,640
Pull, you fools!

157
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,210
Somepony set off the magic forcefield,
and Trixie intends to punish them!

158
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,560
But, wouldn't it be faster
if we had some... wheels?!

159
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,290
The Great and Powerful Trixie
doesn't trust wheels.

160
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,000
Now pull faster!

161
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,740
I'm telling ya, Snips,
she's getting weirder and weirder!

162
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,790
Stop!

163
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,370
You there!
What are you doing?!

164
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,190
Why is she so mean to us?

165
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,620
Yeah! I miss the days
when she was just a fraud!

166
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,711
Oh oh dear!

167
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,860
Rarity's dangerous
mission outfit is ruined!

168
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,390
Guess we'd better go back!

169
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,310
Okay, okay, you're right,
I need to be brave and find Twilight.

170
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,740
Oh! You found her?

171
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,730
She's in the Everfree Forest?!

172
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,330
Oh, this is me being brave!
I wanna be brave at home,

173
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,740
locked in my closet,
with my teddy bear!

174
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,340
I can't believe
I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!

175
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,360
The more she uses it,
the more it will corrupt her!

176
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,800
But how am I supposed
to beat that amulet?

177
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,590
My magic's not good enough!

178
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,390
Twilight Sparkle,
much work have you done.

179
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,590
You learned all of my lessons,
all but one.

180
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,150
If Trixie's tricks have you in a fix,

181
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,560
you must mix your magic
and use the six.

182
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,020
Mix your magic, use the six...
mix your magic, use the six!

183
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,520
Use the six, that's it!
Zecora, you're a genius!

184
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,170
Now I need to get you back
inside Ponyville, Fluttershy.

185
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,550
This better not be another false alarm,

186
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,460
or the Great and Powerful Trixie will--

187
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,940
You!

188
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,780
What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle?
Not enjoying your exile?

189
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,940
I know about the Alicorn Amulet.
I know you cheated.

190
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,570
Cheated? Moi?

191
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,660
Yeah. And I thought
you might wanna see

192
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,860
what a real magical amulet looks like.

193
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,570
Zecora gave it to me.

194
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,570
It's from beyond the Everfree Forest,

195
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,100
and it's way more powerful
than your measly Alicorn Amulet!

196
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,000
Ha! Nothing's more powerful
than the Alicorn Amulet!

197
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,220
And nopony's more powerful
than the Great and Powerful Trixie!

198
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,090
Care to put your amulet
where your mouth is?

199
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,600
How about another duel?

200
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,830
Why should I?
I already beat you.

201
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,510
That's up to you!
But I guess you'll never see

202
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,130
the totally awesome magic
from beyond the Everfree Forest...

203
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
Come on, Zecora.

204
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,900
Wait!

205
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,520
Okay, okay, you're on!
A second duel.

206
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,590
Let's start with a simple age spell,
shall we?

207
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,880
Let's.

208
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,290
Snips, Snails.

209
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,500
An oldie, but a goodie.

210
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,790
Now let's see
what your little charm can do.

211
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,070
No problem.

212
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,530
Um, Applejack, Rarity?
Could you help me, please?

213
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,930
So you can do an age spell,
big deal.

214
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,580
That's... that's impossible!

215
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,870
That's nothing!

216
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,120
How did you--

217
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,700
Duplication spell.

218
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,610
Ever seen one pony
play ten instruments?

219
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,480
This-- just can't be!

220
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,970
Ooh, one more.
I can turn a mare into a stallion.

221
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,060
Eeyup.

222
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,140
Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet
is more powerful than yours.

223
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,900
Hey! Give it back!

224
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,880
With this amulet,
I shall now rule

225
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,990
all of Equestria!

226
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,280
Witness, my subjects,

227
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,110
gaze upon an ever
greater and powerfuler Trixie!

228
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,520
I don't need
that old Alicorn Amulet.

229
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,610
I have this!

230
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,110
Stop it!
Tha-that tickles!

231
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,290
Tickles?

232
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,780
That was supposed
to make you writhe in agony!

233
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,560
This amulet is defective!

234
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,660
Give mine back!

235
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,290
Sorry. This is going back
into hiding where it belongs.

236
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,540
By the way, Trixie,
the amulet around your neck?

237
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,700
It's one of Zecora's doorstops.

238
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,500
But...
how did you do those spells?

239
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,470
Nopony can do those spells!

240
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,320
You're right.
Not even me.

241
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,730
<i>Zecora taught me so much about
magic while I was in exile.</i>

242
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,280
<i>She even taught me
when not to use it.</i>

243
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,560
<i>My magic alone wasn't powerful enough
to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head,</i>

244
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,670
<i>so I needed to use
a different kind of magic...</i>

245
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,550
<i>the magic of friendship.</i>

246
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,160
I also knew that the only pony

247
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,500
who could get the amulet off
your neck was you.

248
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,430
But what about
the pony with the ten instruments?

249
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,370
That's not magic,
that was just Pinkie Pie.

250
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,650
Trixie?

251
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,780
It's the least I could do.

252
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,200
I treated you and your friends so horribly
when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet...

253
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,510
I just couldn't control myself.

254
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,330
You can forgive me, can't you?

255
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,560
- Sure.
- Oh, great.

256
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,010
Don't you think
the Great and Apologetic Trixie

257
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,180
is the most magnificent humble pony
you have ever seen?
