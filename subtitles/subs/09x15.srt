1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,204
    Twilight: I have to admit
     I was a little shocked

2
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:06,639
         when Princess
        Celestia told me

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,973
   she wanted to start a
   Scholastic Buckball league,

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,876
      but I was even more
    surprised that she wanted

5
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,779
  the first game to be between
   her school and ours!

6
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,481
Apparently, she's
a huge sportsfan.

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,684
       I always thought Celestia
       was kind of a jock.

8
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,785
                Just with really
                wavy hair.

9
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,722
        Anyway, we don't
         have much time.

10
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,157
          The game is in
           two weeks!

11
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,160
      And I want all of YOU
      to coach the team!

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,032
      I know how you feel.

13
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,167
Young athletes ready
to take the field...

14
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,036
   Ooh! You can almost
   breathe in the excitement!

15
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,841
I don't think you should
breathe it in so hard!

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,380
       It's just... two
       weeks doesn't feel

17
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,750
    like a whole lot of time
    to train a <i>whole team</i>.

18
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,518
                 Maybe the
                 School of Magic

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,053
            could play a few
            other schools first.

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,688
           Like the Mane and
           Tail Styling College,

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,357
            or the Scroll-Making
            Institute?

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,592
             Relax. You're
             gonna do just fine.

23
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,562
Um... what makes
you so sure?

24
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,897
      Because I have faith
        in my friends...

25
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,732
           who also
          happen to be..

26
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,469
      the best buckball
      players in Equestria!

27
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,504
            Oh, yeah!

29
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,752

      sort of true.

30
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,820
       I asked Rainbow
        Dash to help too.

31
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,755
        But I'm not sure
         where she...

32
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,758
    Sorry I'm late! But when
    Twilight said she needed

33
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,059
        my help with the
        buckball team,

34
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,627
      I figured I'd better
      grab every piece of

35
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,429
       coaching equipment
        I could find!

36
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,832
         So, what should
         I focus on?

37
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,235
        Offense? Defense?
          Trick plays?

38
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,105
I was thinking of something
even more important!

39
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,540
       Awesome! Lay it on
       me! Whatever it is,

40
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,243
     I'll give it a hundred
     and twenty percent!

41
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,545
      I knew I could count
       on your enthusiasm!

42
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:57,049
    That's why I want you to
    coach.. the Cheer Squad!

43
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,986
          CHEERLEADING?

46
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,536
      It's just, when you
     said you wanted my help

47
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,671

Well, sure Cheer Squad
is <i>totally</i> important

to somepony
who isn't me,

53
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,520
but I'm more about ponies
playing <i>in</i> the game,

54
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,955
not cheering for it.

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,126
I mean, it's great
that someponies

56
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,995
only want to cheer, though I
don't know why they would.

57
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,098
       Hm. Well, maybe this will
       be a good opportunity

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,433
            for you to find out.

59
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,036
       Of course I've seen
      cheer squads before...

00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,071
        On the sidelines...

   percent sure what they do.

62
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,241
        I'll probably
        just mess it up.

63
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,210
               I think you might
               be surprised.

64
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,512
               In fact, I'm more

65
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,413

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,524
        The cheer squad

What do you mean?

70
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:50,395
   Well, I've been helping out
   and let's put it this way.

71
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,798
       We've got two weeks
       until the big game

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,534
        and.. we could
         use two years...

73
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,003
         But that's all
          gonna change

74
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,907
       because you're here
      to save the day!

75
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,911
Oh...kay. So why
are <i>you</i> here?

76
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,413
             What, a pony can't
             show school spirit?

77
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,349
You don't even go
to this school.

78
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,986
    Ah OK, when I went to the
     Buckball Hall of Fame,

79
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:18,257
     I found out buckball
     souvenirs are BIG bits!

80
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,059
          If Twilight's
         team does well,

81
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:22,862
    I can start selling them
     full time in Ponyville,

82
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,898
                 so <i>I</i> have a
                 vested interest

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,168
                and <i>you</i> have an

84
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,873

00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,208

00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,959
      [giggle] I'm Shimmy Shake, and
      this is Lighthoof!

92
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,828

93
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,833

            three would be here...

94
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,504
       Yona want to cheer
     and make pony pyramid!

95
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,508
       And I thought this
       could be my chance

96
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,977
      to make an impression
       on everypony!

97
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,947
   You know, for something
   other than changing shape...

98
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,550
    I didn't realize you were
    into school spirit, Smolder.

99
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,586
Uh, I just came with these
two. Guess they think

100
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,889
     you can make cheer
    squad cool or something...

101
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,490
              Don't count on it.

102
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,361
     OK, now that we're all
     here, why don't you

103
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,730
      tell us the plan? How
      are you gonna make

104
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,301
    us into the most awesome
    cheer squad ever!?

105
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,870
          Uh, I dunno.

106
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,674
    I mean, if you guys were
    an actual buckball team,

107
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,462
    I'd have plenty of ideas,

108
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:47,446
    but I don't know anything
    about cheerleading.

109
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,949
         Oh, ha-ha, yes.
        Good one, coach!

110
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,652

     know what you're doing.

          Ha-ha. Right.
          OK, gang.
