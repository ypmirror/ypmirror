1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:07,372
             [snap] Oh!

2
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,148
       Ah. Thank goodness.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,150
       I thought I had too
      many deep fried gems.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,222
      It's from my parents!

5
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:24,222
             Spike!

6
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,593
 They won a zeppelin cruise and
  get to take the whole family!

7
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:32,231
       Ohh...I wish I had
      time to go with them,

8
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,999
      but there's just too
      many Princess duties

9
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,367
     I have to take care of.

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,671
       Come on, Twilight.

11
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,106
     Even Princess Celestia
     takes a break sometimes

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,774
     and she raises the sun!

13
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,081
   Ugh. You need a vacation.

14
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,783
       I can keep track of
       the Friendship log,

15
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,919
   boost community morale and
 answer fan mail for a few days.

16
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:57,222
   But Spike, you're as much a
  part of my family as anypony.

17
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,658
     I can't just leave you
    here to do all that work.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,926
              What?

19
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,161
        I can't hear you.

20
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,230
       You're on vacation.

21
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:08,934
 I guess I could use a little
 time off from being a Princess.

22
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,836
     You're the best, Spike.

23
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,471
             I know.

24
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,575
 I'm going to go pack everything
    neatly into one suitcase!

25
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,311
          Wait for it....

26
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,712
 Twilight: Cruises have activities, right?

27
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,381
        I should probably
        make a schedule!?

28
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,582
          There it is.

29
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:11,530
  Oh, gee, I am really looking
 forward to a relaxing vacation.

30
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:12,664
Watch out.

31
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,766
She won't admit it, but
when your mother says

32
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,301
"relaxing vacation"

33
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,337
she means "doing
something crazy."

34
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,540
Last time she ended up bungee
jumping over Luna Bay.

35
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,708
What was that, hon?

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,743
        Oh, I was uh just
        telling Twilight

37
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,145
     about my new uh, bingo
         strategy book.

38
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,147
    It's a real page-turner!

39
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,419
 Oh, I can't wait to get on this
zeppelin and fly like a pegasus!

40
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,155
Really? I remember
you getting air-sick

41
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,926
  on Admiral Fairweather's Wild
      Ride at Pony Island.

42
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,297
    Ah please, I grew out of
  air-sickness a long time ago.

43
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:52,838
     [drill sargeant voice]
<i>I hope you ponies feel welcomed</i>
 <i> aboard BECAUSE YOU ARE!</i>

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,407
        Well, that was an....
       assertive welcome.

45
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,637
  Guess this is what it's like
  to be big-time prize winners.

46
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,139
            Ha ha ha.

47
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:30,442
  I just wish I could remember
      what contest we won.

48
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,779
   Wait. You don't know where
      this prize came from?

49
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,782
      When somepony offers
      you a free vacation,

50
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,285
   you just sign the paperwork
    and don't ask questions.

51
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,623
   Especially when it means we
  all get to fly off together.

52
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,091
    What should we do first?

53
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,560
     Well, I did categorize
      the ship's activities

54
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,963
  and make a schedule organized
    by each of our interests!

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,231
        Dad, you're easy.

56
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,434
  Bingo competition right here.

57
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,504
 Oh, I just love how the numbers
    and letters are organized

58
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,139
     in their little boxes.

59
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,841
       It's so satisfying!

60
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,010
     Shining Armor, they've
      got a tiny boat race

61
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,812
      in a tiny pool, here.

62
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:10,916
     Aw, sis, only you would
  remember I love tiny things.

63
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,016
          And Cadance?

64
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,285
        There's a Pee-wee
     Princess Playtime here

65
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,754
    that Flurry's gonna love.

66
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,057
Oh! Wonderful!

67
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,692
              Hmmm.

68
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:25,264
This barrel jumping at Neighagra
    Falls sounds interesting.

69
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:26,832
               Eh.

70
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,536
       I just want to see
    you all have a good time.

71
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,004
  And this works out perfectly,

72
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,607
    because we have room for
   the one thing I want to do!

73
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,177
       Our ship passes the
     Frozen North at sunset,

74
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,212
 which is the only time you can
 see the astrological phenomenon

75
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,582
 known as the "Northern Stars."

76
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,551
It's like the stars are shooting
     out of the setting sun!

77
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:49,353
      Aw!
      That sounds amazing!
      Wow!

78
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,190
Well, we definitely
don't want to miss that!

79
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,126
       Then it's settled!

80
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,728
      Hm, but we don't have
    anything to do right now.

81
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,896
        Any suggestions?

82
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,568
 ATTENTION CRUISE PONIES: DON'T
  LET THIS ZEPPELIN BE A BORE;

83
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,471
         LEAVE YOUR ROOM
        AND SEE THE TOUR!

84
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,506
      A tour could be fun.

85
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,442
            Hmm yea!
            OK, Sure.

86
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,547
        I'm flying! I'm--

87
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,118
       I'm afraid
     Flurry may be air-sick.

88
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,554
     Since I know that isn't
       a problem for you,

89
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,923
         would you mind
        taking her below?

90
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,129
      FAR TO OUR RIGHT, YOU
        CAN JUST MAKE OUT

91
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,097
  THE WHITE TUFTS OF CLOUDSDALE

92
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:37,168
 WHERE PRINCESS TWILIGHT SPARKLE
ONCE TOURED THE WEATHER FACTORY.

93
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,539
       How'd he know that?

94
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,474
And why announce it on a cruise?

95
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,748
    Why don't we move to the
     other side of the deck?

96
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,088
     WE ARE NOW HIGH ENOUGH
    TO SEE ALL OF CANTERLOT,

97
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,158
    EVEN THE ROYAL TREE WHERE
        PRINCESS TWILIGHT

98
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,695
     AND HER BROTHER SHINING
        ARMOR WERE BORN!

99
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,463
What? That's not right.

100
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,402
    Let's get down for that!

101
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,772
    Um, you guys know that's
     not where we were born.

102
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,507
 What are you so excited about?

103
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,277
      Well, it is a really
     nice tree, sweetheart.

104
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,350
We just wanted to say how
excited we are to be here!

105
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,953
               Um, yeah, us too.

106
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:33,258
ON OUR ROUTE NORTH, WE WILL PASS
THE SPIRES OF THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE

107
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,363
 WHERE PRINCESS CADANCE RESCUED
    HER ALICORN BABY, SPIKE,

108
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,166
  FROM A MONSTER MADE OF FIRE!

109
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,101
       Well, that doesn't
        even make sense!

110
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:46,436
       Night Light: "Well,
       Royal Grandparents" sounds a bit fancy,

111
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,740
        but of course you
      can take our picture.

112
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:52,944
                         What!?

113
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,320
          OH!

114
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,322
         OK, that's it!

115
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,858
     Does anypony know where
    the cruise announcer is?

116
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,996
         Excuse me, sir.

117
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,500
        YOU CAN CALL IRON
        WILL, IRON WILL.

118
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,235
    [gasp] What are you doing here?

119
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,037
       And why do you keep
    announcing random things

120
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,372
     about me and my family?

121
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,874
        THE ASSERTIVENESS
    SEMINAR MARKET DRIED UP,

122
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,210
      SO IRON WILL STARTED
         A NEW CAREER...

123
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:28,680
        ORGANIZING THEMED
       VACATION PACKAGES.

124
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,149
      And the theme of this
        vacation is... ?

125
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,855
 EVERYPONY! STOMP YOUR HOOVES IF
  YOU ARE HERE FOR THE PREMIER

126
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,692
         'CRUISE OF THE
     PRINCESSES' EXPERIENCE!

127
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,843
 Iron Will, I'm not sure it was
 entirely honest of you to offer

128
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,846
    this cruise to my family
       without telling us

129
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,849
   that ponies bought tickets
   just to see Cadance and me!

130
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,552
   Iron Will outlined all the
  details of the cruise in the

131
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:12,324
  prize acceptance and consent
      form that you signed.

132
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,260
   Well, when somepony offers
      you a free vacation,

133
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,263
    who reads the fine print?

134
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,465
        Iron Will prides
      himself on providing

135
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,601
 a quality vacation experience,

136
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:27,572
   but if Twilight Sparkle and
    her family don't want it,

137
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,175
 Iron Will can cancel the cruise

138
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:36,415
  and break the hearts of every
 Princess-adoring pony on board.

139
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:37,516
             Ugh...

140
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,385
             I love you Princess
                 Twilight!

141
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,021
        As much as I want
       a family vacation,

142
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,957
 I don't think I could entertain
    all these cruise ponies.

143
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,994
    My hooves are pretty full
  taking care of Flurry Heart.

144
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:53,031
 I guess we were just so excited
 by the idea of a family cruise.

145
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:58,136
  [sigh] All right, I guess we
  better turn this ship around.

146
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,941
    Wait! Iron Will, what if
      I offered you a deal?

147
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,411
    If I agree to do whatever
  princess activities you want,

148
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,912
        will you promise
         that my family

149
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,281
         gets to do the
      activities they want?

150
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,250
Sis, you don't
have to do that.

151
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,085
         We want you to
       enjoy yourself too.

152
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:18,690
I don't want the vacation to end
  now or let down all of these

153
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,760
     ponies who were looking
      forward to seeing us.

154
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,363
    So what do you say, Iron
    Will? Do we have a deal?

155
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,166
PRINCESS TWILIGHT
HAS A DEAL!

156
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:29,835
                    Great!

157
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,604
  So it looks like we have some
  time before Dad plays Bingo-

158
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,873
     ACTUALLY, WE HAVE JUST
    ENOUGH TO PICK THE WINNER

159
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,508
   OF OUR GRAND PRIZE RAFFLE.

160
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,811
     Oh. Well, [chuckle] who
      doesn't like prizes?

161
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,982
    ALL RIGHT CRUISE PONIES:

162
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,953
     WHEN THE ZEPPELIN FLIES
     IT'S TIME FOR A PRIZE!

163
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,293
   Thank you all for being so
     gracious and respectful

164
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,828
      to me and my family.

165
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,831
    And now, without further
      ado, the winner is...

166
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,301
          Star Tracker!

167
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,371
 Congratulations, Star Tracker!

168
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,639
        Enjoy your prize.

169
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,208
       OK Dad, bingo time!

170
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,243
            Uh...Oh!

171
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,013
       I'm sorry, I don't
         have the prize.

172
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:19,984
 CONGRATULATIONS TO STAR TRACKER
    WHO WINS THE GRAND PRIZE:

173
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,020
 SPENDING THE DAY WITH TWILIGHT

174
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,557
      AS AN HONORARY MEMBER
         OF HER FAMILY!

175
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,561
        That's the prize!?

176
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,997
               Uh huh...heh heh.

177
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,333
      OK! Well, I guess you
      should come with us,

178
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,001
     honorary family member!

179
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,605
    Sure! Hah. There's always
    room at the bingo table.

180
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,075
              Ahem.

181
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,677
       Is everypony ready?

182
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,678
Night Light: Sure are, sweetie.

183
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,882
     Give that cage a whirl!

184
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:51,850
              Dad?

185
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:52,984
        [on megaphone] What did you say?

186
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,054
      Uh...he...He said to
    uh...give it a...a whirl.

187
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,589
         Oh! Um, thanks.

188
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,964
              I-19!

189
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,133
     Heh hey! Now we're talking!

190
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,003
  This Princess Bingo is great!

191
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,773
   Did you get that one, Dad?

192
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,942
       [on megaphone] Can anypony tell me
      how my dad is doing?

193
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,845
  He uh...he said the Princess
     Bingo is uh great hah.

194
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,146
        Crowd: Princess Bingo!

195
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,115
  Princess Bingo!

196
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,217
                 Princess Bingo!

197
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,753
Twilight is my
favorite time of day. Heh heh.

198
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:29,955
         And it's
         also your name.

199
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,257
      [nervous laugh] I just thought
         that was cool.

200
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,063
              Whew!

201
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,163
          Just made it!

202
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:43,034
  And I'm ready to give you the
  tiny boat race of your life!

203
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,372
     Are you sure you're not
     air-sick, Big Brother?

204
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,239
             No way.

205
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,941
     How can I be air sick?

206
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,211
      I'm in the water, so
     it totally cancels out.

207
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,350
   I don't think that's how it
works, but I'm ready if you are!

208
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,986
 TECHNICALLY, PRINCESS TWILIGHT
    SPARKLE SHOULD OFFICIATE

209
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,621
 THE PRINCESS PADDLE BOAT RACE.

210
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,560
     Well, I suppose I could
       race your brother.

211
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:13,798
 Oh. Well, as long as Shining Armor
    gets to race, I'm happy.

212
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:19,504
             Heh heh..

213
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,304
             Sorry....

214
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:24,075
  I'm going to write about this
   race tonight in my journal.

215
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,545
        Ha ha. Uhhh! It's
        just so exciting!

216
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,546
         On your mark...

217
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,447
           Get set...

218
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,782
           GO! Ha ha!

219
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,452
           Woooooooo!

220
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,254
       Ha ha ha! My word,
       that was exciting!

221
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,789
         Wasn't it, son!?

222
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:38,923
            Ha ha ha!

223
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,329
  Just so everypony knows, I'm
    getting out of this boat

224
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,265
 because of how not sick I feel.

225
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:53,671
  Awww, that's all right dear,
we'll take you back to the room.

226
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,743
THAT WAS JUST THE
FIRST HEAT OF TEN.

227
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,582
       NOW WHO'S READY TO
       SEE A PRINCESS FACE

228
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,118
          WHEN THEY WIN
           THEIR RACE?

229
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,319
              Yeah!

230
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,487
            Whoo hoo!

231
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,866
            Twilight: Cadance.

232
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,704
   I'm so glad you got in the
   Pee-wee Princess Playtime.

233
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,306
        Flurry is having
        a wonderful time.

234
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,510
     That's great; I'm just
     on my way to take some

235
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,078
   Old-Time Appleoosan Photos.

236
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,848
Themed photo shoots
are the best. Heh.

237
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,451
And then do a quick question and
  answer session on becoming an

238
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:42,654
   Alicorn before Mom's barrel
    ride at Neighagra Falls.

239
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,156
I really hope I don't miss that!

240
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,458
     Twilight, are you sure
      you don't mind doing

241
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,660
      all of these Princess
           activities?

242
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,963
   Mind? What? Absolutely not!

243
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,999
      I mean, you guys are
       having fun, right?

244
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,836
 Ughh...besides, I have to make
    sure these cruise ponies

245
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,272
     are happy if I want to
       be a good Princess.

246
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,108
      You're already a good
       Princess, Twilight.

247
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,544
  Honestly, as long as I get to
 see the Northern Stars tonight

248
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,613
 with everypony, I'll be happy.

249
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,651
      But right now I gotta
     go take some pictures.

250
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:14,686
          See ya later!

251
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,256
Why don't you play and
make a Princess friend!

252
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:27,999
Uh.. I am so sorry, everypony, but it
looks like Flurry needs her nap.

253
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,206
 Oh! Why did that last question
    have to be a two-parter?

254
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,009
   I just hope I have time for
    one barrel ride with Mom.

255
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,883
              Ohh!

256
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:48,186
  Neighagra Falls was amazing!

257
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,754
      The endless open air!

258
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,389
      The water in my mane!

259
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,426
     Oh! The small confines
         of the barrel!

260
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:59,464
    Ha ha! Another "relaxing
  vacation" in the books, hon.

261
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,403
        Oh, honey, I know
      you're disappointed,

262
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,639
        but we waited as
        long as we could.

263
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:11,143
  Maybe you should take a break
   from these Princess things?

264
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,812
        Disappointed? No!

265
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,014
    I've just been answering
     some detailed questions

266
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,081
         about Alicorns.

267
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,050
        You know how much
         I love details!

268
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:23,354
    I just don't want you to
 forget it's your vacation, too.

269
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,891
How can I when it's a
totally successful vacation?

270
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,227
           All right.

271
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:33,064
     Well, we can't wait to
    see those Northern Stars!

272
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,403
      IRON WILL LIVED UP TO
     HIS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN

273
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,205
      AND PRINCESS TWILIGHT
     ONLY HAS ONE MORE THING

274
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,440
       TO DO FOR THE DAY.

275
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,412
     IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE.

276
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:51,816
     COME GET IN LINE IF YOU
   WANT THE PRINCESS TO SIGN!

277
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,201
          How long have
        you been waiting?

278
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,240
             Oh, no.

279
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,175
        What time is it!?

280
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,724
     I missed them? I missed
       the Northern Stars?

281
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,230
    You were right, Twilight.
     They were breathtaking.

282
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,900
     We wish you'd been here
      to see it, sweet pea,

283
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,502
  but we're sure you're making

284
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,972
        a whole bunch of
      cruise ponies happy.

285
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:50,341
    Heheh.. I'm so happy I could cry.

286
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,143
            Oh, yeah.

287
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,178
  The cruise ponies are happy.

288
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,880
       My family is happy.

289
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,915
    Even Iron Will is happy.

290
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,687
    You know who isn't happy!?

291
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:03,688
               ME!

292
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,425
          Ow! My hoof!

293
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,428
    I'm sorry, but maybe that
     wouldn't have happened

294
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,563
   if you weren't practically
      standing on my tail!

295
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,866
        Not even my real
     family stands so close!

296
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,101
              Ugh!

297
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,641
            Twilight?

298
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,710
   I only made that deal with
     Iron Will so my family

299
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,480
and the cruise ponies could have
    the vacation they wanted.

300
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,949
   What about what you wanted?

301
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,019
      I just want everypony
          to be happy.

302
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,588
     Well, sometimes ponies
    want more from a Princess

303
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,790
        than you can give

304
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,459
   and it can be hard to know
     where to draw the line.

305
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,528
You seem to know
pretty well.

306
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,033
  Once I had Flurry Heart, the
 line was easier for me to see.

307
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:51,469
      You will always have
   obligations as a princess,

308
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,438
      but you also have an
     obligation to yourself.

309
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,241
   You're right.

310
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,945
   I think I need to set some
     boundaries, but first,

311
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,081
   I owe somepony an apology.

312
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,918
    Aww...how's that, dearie?

313
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,453
         Better, thanks.

314
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,491
  Agh! But I think I should go!

315
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,394
        No, Star Tracker,
        you should stay.

316
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,430
       I have something to
     tell you...all of you.

317
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,933
     I'm glad you all got to
    do the things you wanted,

318
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,735
        but I should have
       stood up for myself

319
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,904
       so that I could do
       what I wanted too.

320
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,606
      It wasn't fair of me
       to lash out at you.

321
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,975
     If I felt like you were
       standing too close,

322
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,543
  I should have said something.

323
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,012
                    I'm sorry.

324
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,018
      What do you say we do
   something off the schedule?

325
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,789
          Who are you..?

326
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:49,294
  Yep! We're gonna do something
  I want us to do as a family.

327
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,529
           Honorary members too.

328
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,348
  You and your family have been
   really kind to include me,

329
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,185
      but you deserve your
     own vacation together.

330
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,287
      Heh heh. And I'm really
     glad we met too. Ha ha.

331
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,421
               Oh!

332
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,893
    Attention, cruise ponies!

333
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,963
    If it's your dream, come
   to the deck for ice cream!

334
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,133
             Oh no!

335
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,102
    Leave the Princess alone!

336
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,672
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO IRON WILL?

337
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,606
       It's OK, everypony.

338
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,410
              Ahem.

339
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,547
     First, I want to thank
     all of you for coming.

340
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,882
    It means a lot that you'd
   spend your hard earned bits

341
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,117
       just to be with us,

342
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,152
       but I honestly came
         on this cruise

343
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,555
      to take some time off
     from being a Princess.

344
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,057
 I'm just a pony too, after all.

345
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,394
     And even though I want
   everypony here to be happy,

346
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,263
    I'd really like to spend
     the rest of the cruise

347
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,566
    relaxing with my family.

348
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:04,735
  Of course, Princess Twilight!

349
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:08,939
But why was this trip advertised
  as a Cruise of the Princesses

350
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,975
 if you just wanted to get away?

351
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,512
    Iron Will's Cruise of the
 Princesses makes no guarantees

352
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,981
     as to the participation
      of actual princesses.

353
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:17,648
                      What!?

354
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,120
     BUT, IRON WILL LEARNED
       HIS LESSON BEFORE.

355
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,654
  SATISFACTION NOT GUARANTEED.

356
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,890
           NO REFUNDS.......!

357
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,532
Wow. He may be pushy
and manipulative,

358
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:38,169
     but nopony can say that
    Minotaur isn't prepared.

359
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,906
      There's still plenty
         of activities.

360
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,941
      We pass Filly Delphia
        on the way back;

361
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,210
    I could give Flurry Heart
      a quick history tour!

362
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,113
     That's very thoughtful,
         but right now,

363
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:53,017
      the family and I have
  something scheduled for you.

364
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,255
   Behold the Northern Stars!

365
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,431
    You did all this for me?

366
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,434
   This is amazing! Thank you!

367
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,370
   And Shining Armor, I can't
     believe you're up there

368
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:13,938
  even though you're air-sick.

369
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,210
     I am not-air--OK, maybe
     I'm not feeling great.

370
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,851
      Now this is the only
        activity I need.
