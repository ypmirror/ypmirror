I guess. I don't know!

183
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,200
The weirdest thing
happened down there.

184
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah, about that. I--

185
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,570
I mean, there I was,
trying to light the torch,

186
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,110
with all of Equestria watching,

187
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,410
and feeling like the
hugest failure ever.

188
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,280
And then the thing just
lit. It was amazing!

189
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,470
Oh! Phew! I was afraid
you'd be upset.

190
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,130
Upset? Are you kidding? Why
would I be upset to discover

191
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,330
I can light fire with my mind?

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,780
Huh?

193
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,760
Look! It's the Great
and Honorable Spike

194
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,940
the Brave and Glorious!

195
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,320
Can we get your autograph?

196
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,560
Sure!

197
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,940
How you saved our empire
last time you were here

198
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,490
was really amazing.

199
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,920

else is amazing?

Better be careful with that.
Might burst into flames later.

stuff with my mind,

213

mindreading must be
just around the corner,

214
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,850

are about to ask me

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,570
No. Because you can't.

217
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh really? So how do you explain
what happened down there

218
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,240
in front of thousands
and thousands--

219
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,520
I did it, Spike. I cast a
spell to do it for you.

220
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,470
... in front of thousands

221
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,300
I'm sorry, Spike.

222
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,820
I just couldn't stand to
see you stuck like that.

223
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,010
You understand, don't you?

224
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,410
I, uh...I need to be
alone right now.

225
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,960
Spike?

champs of the Games anyway!

I let everypony down. Twice!

356
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,880
You never let anypony down

357
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,520
so you have no idea
what that's like.

358
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,250
Are you kidding? I've
totally let ponies down.

359
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,530
That's not the point.

360
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,000
The torch got lit; the aerial
relay teams got their medals.

361
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,370
No harm no foul.

362
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,120
Can we at least watch
from inside there?

363
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm not sure I'm ready to face
crowds in the stands just yet.

364
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,790
<i>(crackling)</i>

365
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,040
<i>(gasps)</i>

366
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,810
<i>(panicked screams)</i>

367
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,450
NO!

368
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,130
Steer it towards the field!

369
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,720
Away from the crowds!

370
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,030
Somepony cut the
disabling spell!

371
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,400
There isn't time!

372
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,060
Dash! Fluttershy! MOVE!

373
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,950
<i>(crackling and hiss)</i>

374
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,850
<i>(roaring cheer)</i>

375
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,620
That was awesome!

376
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,910
I just wanted to
thank you personally

377
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,520
for saving those ponies,
and the Games,

378
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,670
O Great and Honorable Spike
the Brave and Glorious.

379
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,690
You must be very proud.

380
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,800
I guess.

381
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,400
All: You guess?

382
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,940
I just saw what needed
to be done and reacted.

383
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,160
It just so happens
I can breathe fire.

384
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,610
If any of you could do that,
you'd have done the same.

385
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,600
Forgive me for
being blunt, Spike,

386
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,760
but you're not makin'
a lick of sense.

387
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,870
It's just how I feel.

388
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,600
Wait a second. I
think I get it.

389
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,760
You keep saying you
let everypony down.

390
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,610
But we all keep
saying you didn't.

391
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,850
You know who was disappointed
in you, Spike? You.

392
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,630
And only you can make
it right with you again.

393
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,490
<i>What would that take, Spike?</i>

394
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,290
I don't know. Can
you turn back time?

395
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,770
Cause I'd sure like a do-over
on that opening ceremony.

396
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,800
We can't turn back time.

397
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,060
But would you do me
the great honor

398
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,080
<i>of lighting fireworks</i>
<i>in my place</i>

399
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,930
<i>at the closing</i>
<i>ceremonies tonight?</i>

400
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,320
Come on, Spike.

401
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,890
You've saved the
Crystal Empire. Twice.

402
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,460
I think you can
light some fireworks.

403
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,340
I guess I have to at
least give it a shot.

404
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,620
<i>(happy chatter)</i>

405
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,020
<i>(cheering)</i>

406
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,080
We did it!

407
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,060
Ponyville won the medal count!

408
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,030
And only by one medal.

409
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,560
Hmm. Wonder which
medal that was?

410
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,690
Bam!

411
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,260
How's it feel to have opened
the best Equestria Games

412
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,770
in Ponyville history, Squirt?

413
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,300
Probably as good as it
feels to close them.

414
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,400
OK, it's time.

415
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,940
<i>Spike: You know,</i>
<i>it's kinda weird;</i>

416
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,470
no matter how many times others
<i>tell you you're great,</i>

417
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,570
<i>all the praise in</i>
<i>the world means nothing</i>

418
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,080
<i>if you don't feel it inside.</i>

419
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,890
<i>Sometimes, to feel</i>
<i>good about yourself,</i>

420
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,490
<i>you've got to let</i>
<i>go of the past.</i>

421
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,770
<i>That way, when the time comes</i>
<i>to let your greatness fly,</i>

422
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,280
<i>you'll be able to</i>
<i>light up the whole sky.</i>
