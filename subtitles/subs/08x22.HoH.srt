422
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,928
And it upset you so much the
Tree of Harmony had to test you!

423
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,798
        Oh! I'm gonna get
       expelled for sure!

424
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,767
        [sobbing] Please don't tell
       anypony about this!

425
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,102
   Especially the Professors!

426
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,003
     PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!

427
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:39,871
OK!

428
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:44,174
    [yawn] I'm actually too tired
    to do anything right now.

429
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,544
Yeah. But we can't
go to sleep.

430
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,946
We'll miss the test.

431
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,214
        The TEST! I
         almost forgot.

432
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,549
    [yawn]

433
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,351
      We're all gonna fail.

434
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:58,489
            [snoring]

435
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,026
What if I tell Professor Sparkle
I needed help organizing

436
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,562
  these books and you were all
  kind enough to pitch in?

437
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,063
   I'll get you an extension!

438
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:10,268
[yawn] Thanks, Cozy.
That's nice of you.

439
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,738
       I'm just so sorry I
       caused all of this.

440
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,506
    You're such good friends.

441
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,276
  I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

442
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,879
         Mmmm. No prob.

443
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:24,315
   Friendship is.... Zzzzzzz.

444
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,717
              You get some rest.

445
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,952
           Don't give any of
           this another thought.

446
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,088
      Just let Cozy take
       care of everything....
