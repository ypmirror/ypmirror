Spike: Sure we do!

00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,835
I LOVE Hearth's
 Warming Eve.

10
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,505
    It's all about friends,
   and presents, and family,

11
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,006
         and.. presents!

12
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,710
 It's also about putting aside
 differences to come together,

13
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,846
 like the Earth ponies, pegasi,
 and unicorns did

14
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,448
     on the first holiday.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,184
Oh! Is that why you put
their fire of friendship

16
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,152
on top of the tree?

17
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,986
             To help us remember
                their unity?

18
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,856
       AND 'cause it looks cool.

19
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,858
             This is my favorite
              day of the year!

20
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:02,728
            Not that I don't
            like the other ones.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,596
             Tuesdays are great!

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,234
Yona like any day that
is start of Winter Break.

23
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,937
        Two whole weeks
        without classes.

24
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,040
   How will Ocellus survive?

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,317
          Heheh..

26
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,009
       I think you'll all
       enjoy the time off

27
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,643
        to be home with
        your families.

28
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,579
       To celebrate your
        own traditions.

29
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,314
   Attention, everycreature!

30
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,815
   School is officially out!

31
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,785
               Happy Holidays,
               and we'll see you
                after the break.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,457
  And for those of you
 traveling outside Equestria...

33
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,926
    Yeah, shouldn't you guys
    be getting ready to go?

34
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,263
    If you miss that train,
    it's a really long walk.

35
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,732
   Go pack up, and we'll
    take you to the station.

36
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,312
It's that new bowtie
I wanted, isn't it?

37
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,880
                You'll have
              to wait and see!

38
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,481
 I'm waiting!

39
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,185
But in the meantime,
I'm shaking.

40
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,886
       Wh--what happened?

41
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,089
     Everything's ruined;
    that's what's happened!

42
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,827
And I don't think
it was an accident!

43
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,865
     Somepony was up here!

44
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,301
Over there!

45
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:25,971
            Outside!

46
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,645
That's the Students' Quarters!

47
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,951
                 Might as well
                give up, whoever you are!

48
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,720
                       We got ya
                       cornered!

49
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,123
            Hello?

50
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,291
       Is anypony there?

51
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,893
         I'll check the
         back door!

52
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,694
What's happening?

53
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,164
              [gasp] Another decorating party!?

54
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,633
 Has anycreature come in here?

55
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,034
         Well... yeah.

56
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,302
         All of us did.

57
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,203
            To pack?

58
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,571
      Like you told us to?

59
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,739
After that.

60
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,807
Did you hear
anything?

61
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,708
Uh uh.

62
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:05,577
           What's up?

63
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,178
              Yona done packing!

64
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,148
Is something wrong?

65
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,149
    The back door's locked.

66
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,084
          No way out!

67
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,953
     But whoever did it had
     to have come in here.

68
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,021
          We saw them!

69
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,356
      Whoever did<i> what</i> ?

70
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,060
        Whoa... That...

71
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,996
        Is so not cool.

72
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,333
     And whoever did it
      ran into your rooms.

73
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,538
    No one came out. And all
     of you are still here.

74
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,941
One of you must have done this!

75
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,612
 But why would any of you wanna
 sabotage Hearth's Warming Eve?

76
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,685
        Uh! Yak not do this.

77
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,087
  Yona offended by accusation.

78
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,756
  We don't know what happened.

79
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,692
       Maybe this wasn't
       even on purpose.

80
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,961
       But I want to give
    whoever caused this mess

81
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,864
   a chance to tell the truth
    and explain themselves.

82
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,766
   I'll make it easy for you.

83
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:01,900
        Close your eyes.

84
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,976
     Now, if you did this,
       raise your hoof.

85
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,210
            Or claw.

86
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,378
          Or whatever.

87
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,482
         C'mon, Spike.

88
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,584
    Looks like we have to--

89
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,986
  Spike. You can
  open your eyes.

90
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,354
                     What? Oh!

91
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,222
Er.. what about me?

92
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,524
          You ALL can.

93
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,358
Heh heh!

94
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,695
But since nocreature took
 responsibility for this mess,

95
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,664
     you're ALL gonna have
      to help clean it up

96
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,066
    before you can go home.

97
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,204
     Why do I have to stay?

98
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,072
              Aw! But the holidays!

99
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:46,662
     While you're cleaning,

100
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,779
    we'll bring you into my
     office one at a time.

101
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,249
    Since Honesty is one of
    the Elements of Harmony,

102
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,085
   we want to give you each a
  chance to tell us the truth.

103
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,589
And once we find out who
did it, just you wait!

104
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,124
We're gonna--we'll...

105
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,394
What are we gonna
 do exactly?

106
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,195
     [sigh] The guilty party
      won't be going home

107
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,730
         over Hearth's
         Warming Break.

108
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,933
    She or he will stay here
    for some one-on-one

109
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,335
      friendship lessons.

110
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,804
                But what if none
                of us confesses?

111
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,139
    Then...

112
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,742
I guess there's no
holidays for anycreature.

113
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,678
You'll all stay
over the break.

114
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,424
      All right, let's get
     to the bottom of this.

115
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,292
      Who wants to be
       interviewed first?

116
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,728
           Eh. I'll go.

117
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,929
       Beats mop duty.

118
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,366
                    Hey, I know!

119
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,402
               We can make a
               game out of this!

120
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,804
              See who finishes
              cleaning up first!

121
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,540
                     Whoo hoo!
                     Yak win!

122
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,275
     Yak best at cleaning!

123
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,648
      Let's save time and
       cut to the chase.

124
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,585
    Which one of you did it?

125
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,687
I would never do
something this horrible!

126
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,656
I<i> love</i> Hearth's
 Warming Eve!

127
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,626
And I do NOT want to
miss going home for it.

128
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:11,529
Huh. I didn't even know Changelings
  celebrated Hearth's Warming.

129
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,764
            Oh, yes!

130
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,300
   It's our favorite holiday!

131
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,435
 Well, since Headmare Twilight
  shared it with us last year.

132
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,605
     She gave our hive very
      clear instructions.

133
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,375
             [ahem]

  and fun of Hearth's Warming!

   Here's a guide to help you

136

  You<i> might</i> have misunderstood
     things just a little.

147
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,803
Eh, we may not have
done everything

148
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,805
exactly the way you do.

149
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,807
        But we made our
        own traditions!

150
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,576
   And I can't wait to do
    it all again this year!

151
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,678
  If we ever get out of here.

152
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,880
      Ocellus? Your turn.

153
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:45,958
         What happened?

154
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,359
  What do you think happened?

155
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,760
   I told her I didn't do it.

156
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,730
                 Agh! Yona tired
                   of waiting.

157
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,999
                Yaks ALWAYS home
                 for holidays.

158
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,336
How do you celebrate Hearth's
Warming in Yakyakistan, Yona?

159
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,803
                   Yaks do not.

160
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,206
        Our holiday MUCH better.

161
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,509
      Is called "Snilldar
      Fest." Night before,

162
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,747
  yaks gather things to smash,
   and put them in big pile.

163
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,116
        Then in morning,
        we smash them!

164
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,586
  In afternoon, we smash them
      again. In evening--

165
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,322
       So.. it's just about
       smashing stuff.

166
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,224
        Like all your
        other holidays.

167
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,960
                No! How griffon
                get that idea?

168
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,896
             This holiday about
              so much more.

169
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,264
                 Last year, for
                  example.

170
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,101

00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:16,114
 <i> Then Yak Family build perfect</i>

180
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:26,558
  <i> Then we hang perfect things</i>
  <i> on perfect moss pile, and...</i>

181
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,427
      [All] You smash it.

182
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,496
      What you think Yaks
      are, barbarians?

183
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,866
    Moss pile is for
    special family rituals.

184
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,602
  Last year, ritual for Yona.

185
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,438
      <i> All Yak family</i>
      <i> gather around Yona.</i>

       <i> for first time.</i>

187
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:52,217
  So to recap... your holiday
   is about smashing things,

188
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,418
          and family.

189
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,554
    Two most perfect things
    ever, put together.

190
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,356
      Happy Snilldar Fest!

191
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,995
       Happy Snilldar to
         you too, Yona.

192
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:07,866
   It's so cool to learn new
  traditions from new friends!

193
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,839
Yeah, well one of
these "new friends"

194
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,441
has gotten us
all in trouble.

195
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,143
And they'd better
confess soon.

196
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,212
       Ocellus: Sandbar?

197
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,580
   Sorry, but they said they
   want you to go in next.

198
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,418
              Why the rush to
             get home, Smolder?

199
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,055
  Like you said, dragons don't
 really have holidays, do they?

200
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:31,757
              Meh.

201
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,092
[gasp] That's so sad!

202
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,595
You must do<i> something</i>
in the winter for fun.

203
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,964
       Well, we do have
      "The Feast of Fire".

204
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,500
   Every dragon gets together
     and tells stories.

205
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,136
      The best one wins a
       pile of gemstones.

206
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,339
   Ooh! What story won last year?

207
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,375
       It was called "A
       Dream Come True."

208
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,744
            Come on, now you've
              gotta tell it!

209
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,413
  Uh. Fine.

210
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,883
  Once upon a time, there was
    this sad little dragon.

211
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,122
      <i> Her name was Scales.</i>

212
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,625
       <i> She lived alone in</i>
      <i> the wilderness with</i>
        <i> nothing to eat.</i>

213
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:14,132
   <i> But one night, as she sat</i>
   <i> alone in a storm, she</i>
   <i> heard something.</i>

214
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,902
    <i> It was the Dragon Lord!</i>

215
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,505
   <i> Scales was scared, but the</i>
    <i> Dragon Lord told her</i>

216
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,475
<i> not to be afraid; that he was</i>
<i> taking her to the Dragon Lands</i>

217
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,277
       <i> for a great feast.</i>

218
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,424
  <i> Scales sat with the Dragon</i>
 <i> Lord's family and friends and</i>

219
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:44,195
<i> had the biggest, best dinner</i>
<i> of gemstones she'd ever eaten.</i>

220
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,931
    <i> Then, while the dragons</i>
     <i> were telling stories,</i>

221
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,935
   <i> Scales thought it would be</i>
  <i> so easy to seize power</i>

222
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:54,406
      <i> from this feeble and</i>
     <i> sensitive Dragon Lord.</i>

223
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:57,342
       <i> She saw her chance</i>
      <i> and TOOK IT!</i>

224
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,513
        <i> She claimed the</i>
       <i> bloodstone scepter</i>

225
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,848
       <i> and took over the</i>
       <i> Dragon Lands.</i>

226
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,583
           Bwahahah!

227
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,619
 <i> ...and forced the Dragon Lord</i>
  <i> to live out in the cold</i>

228
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,155
    <i> just as she used to do.</i>

229
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,495
       That's a horrible story!

230
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,062
Maybe to you..

231
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,764
But dragons like
hearing about weak,

232
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,566
kind creatures
getting defeated.

233
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:22,901
[Rainbow Dash] Silverstream!

234
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,035
  You're up.

235
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,404
Let's go!

236
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,276
               So, did you tell
               them you did it?

237
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,844
         What? No way!

238
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:33,945
     Why would I say that?

239
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,880
        You already live
         in Ponyville.

240
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,116
    Staying here over
     break is no big deal.

241
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,921
School of Friendship good place
 for pony to have pony holiday.

242
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,657
I'd still rather spend it
with my family at home.

243
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,325
      Oh! That reminds me!

244
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,228
     I have the BEST
      holiday story ever!

245
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,232
    It's called "The Day My
     Hearth's Warming Doll

246
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,701
  Almost Fell into the Fire!"

247
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,903
         [All] Ohhhhh!

248
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,940
     <i> Just before we went to</i>
     <i> bed, my mom, my dad,</i>

249
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,542
   <i> and my sister all put our</i>
  <i> Hearth's Warming Dolls</i>

250
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,679
     <i> up on the mantle, just</i>
     <i> like we do every year.</i>

251
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,080
        <i> But THIS year...</i>

252
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,317
    <i> I put my doll too close</i>
    <i> to the edge and it FELL!</i>

253
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,187
           [slowly] NOOOOOOO!

254
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,192
                         And!?

255
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,761
     My doll hit the floor.

256
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,130
       BUT! It could have
       gone in the fire!

257
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,666
That's a great story.

258
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,168
And you told it
 really well.

259
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,138
    Yeah. It was a Hearth's
     Warming miracle!

260
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,739
                Next!

261
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,375
Smolder, come with me.

262
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,610
Yona, Twilight's
waiting for you.

263
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,516
         The last two.

264
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,720
   So if neither one of them
    confesses, that means...

265
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,422
    We're never going home!

266
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,595
     We'll be here forever!

267
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,397
Beyond forever.

268
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,701
But I can't miss the Three
Days of Freedom Celebration!

269
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,037
    How long does that last?

270
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,974
It used to be only ONE day, but
 now to commemorate our escape

271
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:14,279
from the Storm King,
we're adding two more
days of awesome!

272
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,214
              See!

273
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,182
        There's a book?

274
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,385
  Mm hm! Queen Novo had these
 made for the Mt. Aris

275
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,421
   board of tourism. To
   explain it all to guests!

276

     <i> We'll spend the first</i>

     <i> Queen Novo is going to</i>

291
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,445
    Wait. Hold on. Cousins?

292
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,546
        What are those?

293
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,448
       Your aunt's and
       uncle's children?

294
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,184
 You know, part of your family.

295
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,587
             Heh. Oh, you're teasing
              us again, right?

296
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,759
     I'm guessing neither
     one of you confessed.

297
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,662
Headmare Twilight
 say wait here.

298
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,899
  Maybe they're changing their
  minds about sending us home.

299
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:41,933
Why would they?

300
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,035
Face it. We're stuck here.

301
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,238
 But, but, I
HAVE to go home!

302
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,141
My mom makes the
best kelp fritters.

303
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,944
       How can you be so
        cool about this?

304
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,746
We're mad.

305
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,181
We just show it
differently.

306
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,316
           More like you don't
               show it at all.

307
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,052
What pony getting at?

308
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,388
       Maybe it wasn't
      just one prankster.

309
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,323
        Maybe there were
         three of you!

310
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,860
 And you're trying to hide
 your guilt by not being upset!

311
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,196
            It does make sense..

312
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,498
         Guys, stop it.

313
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,535
   Or maybe whoever did it is
  only pretending to be upset.

314
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,703
        To throw us off.

315
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,672
              Me? But I didn't!

316
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,574
           Come on, let it go.

317
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,549
       Come on, Ocellus,
      you know you did it!

318
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,917
         Just fess up!

319
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,625
     I SAID stop fighting!

320
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,994
      That's not what the
      holidays are about.

321
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:46,164
   No matter what you call
  them, or how you celebrate.

322
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,601
        Do you know how
       lucky you all are?

323
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,971
    With your stories about
     sharing, and kindness,

324
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,639
      and getting together
       with everycreature

325
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,840
      that you care about?

326
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,644
     But... Griffons do
     that too, don't they?

327
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,414
Some holiday
about a moon?

328
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:05,016
           [sigh] Blue Moon Festival.

329
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,052
The one time of year
when Griffons are nice to each other.

330
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,521
  Well, as nice as we can be.

331
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,126
    <i> Families get together to</i>
     <i> eat and then complain</i>
     <i> about the food.</i>

332
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,528
    <i> And give each other</i>
   <i> presents they don't like.</i>

333
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,931
    <i> And mostly just try not</i>
     <i> to yell at each other.</i>

334
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,700
    Well, at least you get
    to be with your family!

335
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,602
             No...

336
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,870
 Because I don't have a family.

337
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,641
      Sandbar:<i> What about</i>
      <i> Grandpa Gruff?</i>

338
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:30,775
 Gallus:<i> That's just his name.</i>

339
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,811
      <i> He's not anygriff's</i>
      <i> actual grandpa.</i>

340
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,116
    <i> I felt like I never had</i>
    <i> a place in Griffonstone.</i>

341
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,624
    Then I came here,
   and well, met all of you.

342
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,326
     So I don't want to
     go home for the break.

343
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,129
    And that's why... I did it!

344
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,232
      [gasp] Griffon mess
      up decorations?

345
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,833
             Yeah....

346
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:56,835
           It was me.

347
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,236
    I put goo powder in
    the Fire of Friendship.

348
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,841
     So it wasn't Ocellus?

349
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,944
             Why would you ruin
              things for us?

350
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,979
       I didn't plan to!

351
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,647
      I just figured if I
      made a mess,

352
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,816
    our teachers would make
    us stay to clean up.

353
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,118
        We'd be together
        a little longer.

354
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,554
  Well. It worked, didn't it?

355
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,122
Better than I thought.

356
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,891
When Headmare Twilight
threatened to cancel

357
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,328
 winter break, that
meant I would get to
be with all of you,

358
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,363
  through the entire holiday!

359
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,065
  That's why I didn't confess.

360
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,934
       So why are you
      admitting this now?

361
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,772
I hated seeing all you fighting
 and blaming each other.

362
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,708
  That's the opposite of what
  ALL your holidays mean.

363
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,643
  Except maybe yours, Smolder.

364
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:43,448
  I can't keep all of you from
  the happiness of your homes

365
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,683
       and families just
      because I feel bad.

366
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,020
           I'm sorry.

367
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,722
   Don't worry, you won't
   have to tell our teachers.

368
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,691
            I will.

369
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,259
 Twilight: You don't have to.

370
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,294
We already know.

371
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,598
We kinda guessed
it was you.

372
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,434
But we wanted to give you
the chance to tell the truth.

373
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,936
        I'm proud that you did.

374
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,837
   And I'm glad to see you've
     been paying attention

375
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,474
    in Professor Applejack's
     honesty classes.

376
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,776
But you're still gonna
have to make amends.

377
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,980
And stay over break for
extra friendship lessons,
by yourself.

378
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,583
           I'll stay with him.

379
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,218
                       Me, too!

380
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
Yona stay also!

381
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,688
                  I'm staying!

382
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:26,825
             What?

383
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,793
           All right.

384
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,830
     I guess pony holidays
       can't be that bad.

385
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,398
      Now you can finally
      know what it's like

386
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,702
 to spend Hearth's Warming with
  friends who care about you.

387
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,674
Looks like they don't really
need any extra lessons.

388
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,076
    Since you obviously know
     that Hearth's Warming

389
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,612
       is about coming
    together, I'd be honored

390
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,248
    if all of you would
   join my friends as guests

391
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,649
     at our holiday table.

392
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,488
  After we finish cleaning up.

393
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,331
      Hey, this reminds
      me of another story!

394
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:12,703
 The Time I Almost Spilled
Grape Juice on the White Couch.

395
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,039
        Does it have a
       depressing ending?

396
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,742
          I'm not sure pony
          stories work that way.

397
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,780
Um. Gallus want Yona
braid feathers?

398
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,949
          Uuuh. Pass.

399
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,452
