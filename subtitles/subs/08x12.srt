1
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:10,976
           Wha! Whoa!

2
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,383
         Almost...there.

3
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:18,118
              Agh!

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,738
          Ah! I can't wait!

5
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:24,057
  Twilight's School is supposed
    to be amazing inside!

6
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:27,293
    Rarity says there's never
     been a school like it.

7
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,596
               Ah!

8
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:32,798
   I heard the students get to
   do tons of awesome stuff!

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,466
    Do you see anything yet?

10
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,235
            Uh, yeah!

11
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,371
    It looks like...A BROOM!

12
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:41,540
        And a dustpan...
       And some buckets...

13
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,010
   That sounds like a closet.

14
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:45,411
       Try another window!

15
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,617
              Woah!

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,554
    Whooooo's ready for cupcakes!?

17
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,362
  Oh they're not for you, silly!

18
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:04,330
      They're for sharing!

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,132
   First, say something nice.

20
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,001
           Like this.

21
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,770
        Ocellus, you are
        a great listener!

22
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,740
                 Now you get to
                keep one cupcake

23
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,809
              and share one with
               another creature!

24
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,579
   Yona, you're really strong!

25
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,618
              Whoa!

26
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,423
              Wow!

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,363
  All right students, it's time
  to meet some new friends!

28
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,236
             Aaaaah!

29
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,504
      Applejack: Incoming!

30
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:48,828
           Ha-yah!

31
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,615
        That's friendship
        in action, y'all.

32
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,489
       Wow! And I thought
       our school was fun!

33
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:08,360
 Yeah, Miss Cheerilee never
 lets us play buckball in class.

34
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,329
I know. I've tried.

35
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,397
              Hey!

36
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,599
  Why don't we go here instead?

37
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,201
    It's still school, right?

38
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:16,735
              Yeah!

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,540
   [sigh] What could be better
    than learning friendship

40
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,443
     with your best friends?

41
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:27,379
    Learning friendship with
   your best friends and CAKE!

42
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:10,989
              Ahem.

43
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,591
      Good morning, class!

44
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,392
     Today, we're going to
     learn about friendship

45
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,560
        through the ages.

46
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,696
    Spike? Slide one, please.

47
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,900
     Back in the days of
    Chancellor Puddinghead--

48
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,835
           Uh, Spike?

49
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,205
Huh? Sorry, Twilight.

50
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,040
   Still getting used
    to my new wings.

51
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,476
They're pretty great, huh?

52
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,143
    Yes, Spike.

53
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,414
As I was saying... huh?

54
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,282
          What are you
        three doing here?

55
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,184
     We wanna go to
      your school!

56
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,385
            But why?

57
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,987
We want to learn
friendship!

58
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,322
       And play Buckball!

59
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,923
             I see.

60
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,825
        Why don't you
       three come with me?

61
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,028
    Spike? You're in charge.

62
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,829
              Yes!

63
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,085
Hi, Twilight!

64
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:58,670
Looks like you could use a
guidance counsellor's help!

65
00:03:58,872 --> 00:03:59,972
Hint. Hint.

66
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,373
      No thanks, Starlight.

67
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,507
           I got this.

68
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,676
Great....

69
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:08,147
Well, I'll just go dust my office
for the seventieth time.

70
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,248
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

71
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,717
but... you can't be
my students.

72
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,752
                      Why not?

73
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,255
        Isn't this place
       for EVERY creature?

74
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,292
     Yes. But we teach
    friendship lessons here.

75
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,561
   You already know all about
   helping ponies in need

76
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,062
         and being there
         for each other.

77
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,964
             Can't you just give
              us a chance?

78
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,233
             Please...?

79
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,969
You need Cheerilee's
classes, not mine.

80
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,805
 Hurry up! You don't want late
marks on your permanent record!

81
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,543
      All: O dragon, my dragon!

82
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,412
     Spike..? What did you do?

83
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,049
        Ha ha!

84
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,918
Well, I'm not
giving up.

85
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,655
I know we can prove we
belong in this school!

86
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,692
                  Yeah! Um, how?

87
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,394
By showing Twilight we've
still got lots to learn

88
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,796
about friendship.

89
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,798
         And I know just
         where to start.

90
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,269
       Ugh. What in tarnation?

91
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,429
   Apple Bloom!

92
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,314
You know better than to leave
our good tools out like that.

93
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,785
  And aren't you supposed to
  be on harvest duty right now?

94
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:23,188
    Eh, it's not like the apples
     are going anywhere.

95
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,757
     What's gotten into you?

96
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,126
Those chores are
your responsibility!

97
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,228
Farm work is family work!

98
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,231
               Sorry, Applejack.

99
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,367
             Maybe, if I went to
             Twilight's School,

100
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,403
          I'd learn to be better
          at helping the family!

101
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,141
Ah! So that's what
this is all about.

102
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,744
Well, if it's
learning you want,

103
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,847
I'd be happy to give you a
private lesson right now.

104
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,382
Starting with cleanin'
up all this equipment!

105
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,285
         Hmph.

106
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,524
              Please can I go to
              Twilight's school?

107
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:05,931
             Please?

108
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,371
                    PLEASE?

109
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,139
I'm going to call
you Repeatie Bell!

110
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,007
We've been through this.

111
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,674
Please let me concentrate!

112
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,012
How about now?

113
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,583
   So there I was, leading the
    Wonderbolt formation

114
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:29,087
  into a super-dangerous sundog
    spiral, when suddenly

115
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,626
     there was a HUGE storm
      cloud in our way!

116
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,694
What happened?

117
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,729
       My genius happened!

118
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,265
        I changed the
       routine on the fly.

119
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,969
And because my crew are such
tight friends, they followed me!

120
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,904
[gasp] What did you do!?

121
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,540
  Only the coolest thing ever.

122
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,675
 I flew up-
-and did a super-amazing half twist

123
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,512
 into a backflip sonic rainboom!

124
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:57,783
  Hey, I never told that story
   to my students before...

125
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,485
           SCOOTALOO..

126
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:03,656
         Never met her.

127
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,691
               Aw.

128
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:12,630
         They're coming!

129
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,465
           Get ready!

130
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,676
            Look out!

131
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:29,984
              Oof!

132
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,418
 Hey! Watch where you are going!

133
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:38,824
   I was watching, watching
  you drive like a crazy pony!

134
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,994
 Well, maybe if you did not drop
   apples all over the street,

135
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,963
      I would not have to!

136
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,200
Oh, I've never seen Apple Bloom
and Scootaloo argue like this.

137
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,037
  Yeah, they usually go together
   like candy canes and stripes.

138
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:56,941
              Whoa!

139
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,210
My apples!

140
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,580
This is all your
fault, Scootaloo!

141
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,382
  Hey! Sweetie Belle
  is the clumsy one.

142
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,654
       I'm not talking to either
       one of you ever again!

143
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,424
       Goodness! They
       seem really upset!

144
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,795
      It's almost like they
     forgot they're friends!

145
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,597
      I think it's working.

146
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,266
            You are so careless!

147
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,068
         Good plan, Apple Bloom!

148
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,737
Careless!

149
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,205
I will show you who is
the one who is careless.

150
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,442
And great acting,
Sweetie Belle.

151
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,110
     We're an awesome team!

152
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,345
 All right!
Pinkie Pie: Yay!

153
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,446
    Oops.

154
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,715
      You're friends again!

155
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,216
      I knew you would be!

156
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,752
   Candy cane stripes forever!

157
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,794
    Now they'll never let us
     into Twilight's school.

158
00:08:56,503 --> 00:09:00,505
    OK, we've tried shirkin'
     chores, pesterin',

159
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,274
     disguises, fightin'...

160
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,210
         Hmm. We need to
        do something new.

161
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,711
      Something unexpected.

162
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,682
Great idea, Scootaloo!

163
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,784
We haven't tried crying yet!

164
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,754
        Yeah! It always
        works for Rarity!

165
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,622
        I wasn't crying.

166
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,190
       I think it's coming
        from outside!

167
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,232
      Aw, she looks so sad!

168
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,200
 We better go see what's wrong.

169
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,806
        Hey, are you OK?

170
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,575
    Oh, thank you for asking.

171
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,643
             But no.

172
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,812
  I'm having real trouble with

173
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,983
    the School of Friendship.

174
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,385
Twilight won't let
you go either, huh?

175
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,421
     Oh, no, It's not that.

176
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:53,624
      I'm in her class but
      [sob] it's too HARD!

177
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:55,694
                  Really?

178
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,130
        I just moved here
        to go to school,

179
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,433
       but everything's so
       new and different.

180
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,569
      I don't know anypony!

181
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,437
        Well, now you do!

182
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,622
        I'm Apple Bloom.

183
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:09,406
      This is Sweetie
      Belle and Scootaloo.

184
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,577
         We're the Cutie
         Mark Crusaders!

185
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,912
         [sniff] I'm Cozy Glow.

186
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,147
        It's very nice to
        meet you.

187
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,783
        But I don't know
       if I'll stay long.

188
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,654
  I'll probably flunk out; I'm
   having so much trouble

189
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,789
   with my friendship lessons.

190
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,358
     We can help with those!

191
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,194
We know all about friendship!

192
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,296
      And studying with you
     would be almost as good

193
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,597
       as being in class!

194
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,067
   But why would you help me?

195
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,036
      What's in it for you?

196
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,938
That's how
friendship works.

197
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,341
When you give from your heart,
you don't expect anything back.

198
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,709
                  Well, golly!

199
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,144
     If you really mean it,

200
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,062
             Mm hm!

201
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,379
           I could use some help
           with my homework.

202
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:54,052
   I have to do something nice
    for each of these ponies.

203
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,855
              But I don't know
            anything about them.

204
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,759
      And it's so hard to talk
     to ponies you've never met.

205
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:01,894
Well, you're in luck.

206
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,128
'Cause we know all
 those ponies!

207
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,764
Get ready for a
friendship A plus!

208
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,272
         That's Bon Bon.

209
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,007
      If you wanna do
     something nice for her,

210
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,043
     first you gotta figure
      out what she needs.

211
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,345
How am I supposed
to do that?

212
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:21,980
             Just pay attention.

213
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,349
           Friendship is about
            listening to others.

214
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,319
                 Oh. Ow.

215
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,656
       Uh oh. That cactus
       keeps pricking her

216
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,192
      every step she takes!

217
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:37,027
 Hmm. If only there was something to
 protect her from those spines.

218
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:40,777
                Yah!

219
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,235
It looks like you need
help carrying your cactus

220
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,771
so here's a safe way
to take it home. [giggle]

221
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,872
                  Thank you!

222
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,208
           That's so thoughtful!

223
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:53,978
                    I did it!

224
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,280
 Good job!

225
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,681
       But, uh, next time?

226
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,450
Maybe don't give away my helmet.

227
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,118
                 Oopsie.

228
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,187
                 ♪♪

229
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,356
     Green. Purple. Yellow.

230
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,192
            Aaand one more purple.

231
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,561
  Whew. Sorting all those took
   longer than I thought!

232
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,534
You really think Mrs. Cake will
like these new sprinkle shakers?

233
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,938
Mm hm! Now she won't have to use
 rainbow sprinkles all the time.

234
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,772
       She can just pick
      the color she wants!

235
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,577
       Oh, I'm sorry, I
        was out to lunch.

236
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,712
Were you fillies
waiting for me long?

237
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,281
                   No. Um. These
                   are for you.

238
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,386
  Ooh well, what a lovely surprise!

239
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,155
  I can't wait to try them out!

240
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,460
 Look! I made rainbow sprinkles!

241
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,295
     Aren't they wonderful?

242
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,532
But...she...I...

243
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,069
              At least she likes
                her present?

244
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,337
 Uh huh.

245
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:14,726
      Golly! How'd you know that
      would make him so happy?

246
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,962
 Friendship means pitching in to
 help others' chores go faster.

247
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,501
  Specially when their special
   somepony's waiting for 'em.

248
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:31,910
              Ugh.

249
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,813
    That class was sooo boring!

250
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,482
     Not even Miss Cheerilee
      can make the history

251
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,284
      of radishes exciting.

252
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,352
    I bet they don't have to
     learn about that stuff

253
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,587
      at Twilight's school.

254
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,292
           Guess what!

255
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,961
   I got an A on my homework!

256
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,562
          All right!
          Nice goin'!

257
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,434
   And I never could have
   done it without your help.

258
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,368
           No problem!

259
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,137
We just wish we
could've done more.

260
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,506
              Actually, you can.

261
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,675
      Headmare Twilight is
      giving us a big test

262
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,928
     at the end of the week.

263
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:08,880
     And I could really use
     your help studying.

264
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,752
We wanted to go to Twilight's
school more than anything,

265
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,387
but helping you has
been even more fun.

266
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,356
You can count on us!

267
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,378
        Um, intelligence?

268
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,784
            Laughter?

269
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:20,819
              Yes!

270
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,422
         Is it.... control?

271
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:00,291
  Kindness, loyalty, honesty,
  generosity, laughter, magic!

272
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,926
            Yes!
            Woo hoo!

273
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,873
       How'd the test go?

274
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,274
                Were there essay
                   questions?

275
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,842
Did you remember
what we taught you?

276
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,512
            I......... FAILED!

277
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,852
     But how could Cozy Glow
    fail her friendship test?

278
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:28,754
Twilight: Ahem.

279
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,623
I'd like to see you
three in my office.

280
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,867
             I know we wanted to
             be invited inside,

281
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,236
           but it kinda went
           different in my head.

282
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,073
    I can't believe you'd
     do something like this.

283
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,176
           Like.. what?

284
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,579
             You ARE Cozy Glow's
             tutors, aren't you?

285
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,280
       We've been working
       with her for days!

286
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,916
        That's what she told me.

287
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,951
          So you've been setting
           her up to fail?

288
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,353
   How?      What?
                          Huh?

289
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,054
 I know you're upset that I
won't let you come to my school.

290
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:07,191
  But to teach Cozy all the
   wrong things out of spite,

291
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,693
       that's just cruel.

292
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,329
But we taught her
all the right things!

293
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,432
  Then how do you explain these
    friendship test answers?

294
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,734
      What are the six
      elements of harmony?

295
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,070
        Five turtlenecks
      and a cheese grater?

296
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,838
       Who is the Princess
       of Friendship?

297
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,873
            Your mom!?

298
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,208
      I-I don't understand....

299
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,077
           Me neither.

300
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,845
  I never thought you three
  would pull such a mean prank.

301
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,314
      I'm afraid I'm going
      to have to ask you

302
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,981
        to stay away from
          my school...

303
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,483
        and my students.

304
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,092
             Oh, no!

305
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,710
Hmm!

306
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:49,835
        [sarcastic] Yay.

307
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,636
    Now I'll alphabetize
     them in reverse order.

308
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,640
    [sigh] Not much need for
    a guidance counselor

309
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,108
   at a School of Friendship.

310
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,609
              Cozy Glow: Ahem!
               Ah!

311
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,844
 H-How much of that
   did you hear!?

312
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:01,746
   Never mind.

313
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,817
              Heh. Welcome!

314
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,652
 Can I get you a comfort pillow?

315
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,086
        Security blanket?

316
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,689
         Empathy cocoa?

317
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,358
        I just need some advice.

318
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,460
         Oh! Well, I have
         plenty of that!

319
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,363
     Anecdotes, insight,
     midnight confessions...

320
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,398
          I'm babbling.

321
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,702
 Ahem. Go ahead. I'm... listening.

322
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,138
            I think I got my
             friends in trouble.

323
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,776
They helped me study for my
friendship test and I failed it.

324
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,678
                     On purpose.

325
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,780
     Tch. Why would you do that!?

326
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,149
Uh.... sorry, listening.

327
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,519
  Well, the Cutie Mark Crusaders
   wanted to go to this school

328
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,987
       more than anything.

329
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:47,024
    So I thought if I showed
    Headmare Twilight

330
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,928
they're bad at friendship, she'd
 let them come here with me!

331
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,863
         That's devious!

332
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,932
         I mean...I see.

333
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,669
  I guess I still have a lot
   to learn about friendship.

334
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,707
Actually, I think
you're doing all right.

335
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,309
 Sure, that was a
really, really bad way

336
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,977
 to try to help
  your friends.

337
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,581
But what matters
is, you wanted to.

338
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,350
    The reason the Cutie Mark
   Crusaders don't go to this

339
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:15,486
   school is that they'd make
 better teachers than students!

340
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,922
            So you DO have a
            place for them here?

341
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,490
                           Hmmm.

342
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,066
   Hmph. I bet there's no Wonderful
    World of Cleaning lesson

343
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,868
      at Twilight's school.

344
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,472
We'll never find out now.

345
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,043
      I still don't get how
      Cozy failed her test

346
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,011
    after all that studying!

347
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,681
Or how Twilight could
blame us for it!

348
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,150
  Or how gum can be so sticky!

349
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,921
       Sorry to interrupt,
       Miss Cheerilee,

350
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,591
  but can I borrow Apple Bloom,
  Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?

351
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,872
      We didn't do anything
       wrong, we promise!

352
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,041
        I know that. Now.

353
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,076
      Which is why I wanted
         to talk to you.

354
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,979
Wait. So we're
not in trouble?

355
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,298
              Just the opposite.

356
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:19,016
   Cozy Glow, is there
  something you'd like to say?

357
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,719
      This is all my fault.

358
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,422
       I messed up my
        test on purpose,

359
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,824
       so we could all go
       to school together!

360
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,259
           I'm sorry.

361
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,328
Thank you, Cozy Glow.

362
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,530
Honesty is one of the
pillars of friendship.

363
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,432
But you already know that.

364
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,534
Which is why I'd like
to give you these.

365
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:38,258
Oof!

366
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:45,243
   They're honorary diplomas,

367
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,613
  making y'all official
 graduates of this here school.

368
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,948
You've more than
earned them.

369
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,083
                Without even
                having to study!

370
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,158
                           Yeah!

371
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,864
       We are grad-u-ates!
       We are grad-u-ates!

372
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,767
  And, if you're interested, I
  think Starlight has a place

373
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,636
 for you at my school after all.

374
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,255
Really?
Wooo hooo!

375
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,873
   We could use some good
   friendship tutors on staff.

376
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,142
       And I hear you're
       the best out there.

377
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,310
Then what're we
waiting for?

378
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,879
Let's get tutoring!

379
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,982
          C'mon, Cozy!

380
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:28,519
And THAT's why this school needs
 you as our guidance counselor.
