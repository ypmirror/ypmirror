00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,291
    Stand-up, classic gags,
  physical humor, prop comedy,

276
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,293
     vaudeville, surrealist
   alt-scene character pieces...

277
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,895
        Nothing's worked!

278
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,263
It seems we've
exhausted every avenue

279
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,933
that even the science
of comedy can provide.

280
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,034
                That's it, then.

281
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,670
What do you mean?

282
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:27,439
     [sigh] I appreciate everything
      you've done, Pinkie,

283
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,942
      but if you can't make
      me laugh, nopony can.

284
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,878
       But, sir, you can't
         just surrender.

285
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,147
      It doesn't look like
       I have a choice.

286
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,150
    I need to figure out how
    to live.. without a laugh.

287
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,486
   I know you tried your best,
  but it's time you went home.

288
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,122
             [gasp]

289
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,192
             I too am horrified.

290
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,501
      So that's it? You're
      all just giving up?

291
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,137
I'm afraid Mr.
Sandwich is right.

292
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,306
You are the funniest
pony in Equestria

293
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,174
and if you can't
bring back his laugh,

294
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,243
it.. is surely
gone forever.

295
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,246
       But.. Cheese was just
        as funny as me!

296
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,514
         I.. can't believe
        that's all gone!

297
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,317
         None of us can.

298
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,986
I shudder to think what
will become of the factory.

299
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,121
             You're not going to
             close down are you!?

300
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,224
        I thought this place was
        Cheese's life's purpose!

301
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,194
It certainly was mine,
but if Mr. Sandwich

302
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,263
has finally given up,
there's only so long

303
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,831
we can re-tool
his old ideas

304
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,666
before we run out
of gags to produce.

305
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:33,071
I don't suppose.. you'd
consider working here?

306
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,805
Your fresh take on
our classic gags

307
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,941
rivals Mr. Sandwich
in his prime.

308
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,010
        I need to find my
         life's purpose,

309
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,611
but I don't
think that's it.

310
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,812
I'm a party pony!

311
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,349
      I need to make ponies
       happy in real time!

312
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:48,353
   Ah, yes. In our early days,
  nothing brought Mr. Sandwich

313
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,488
  more pleasure than seeing the
  laughter his gags brought

314
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,856
      to ponies first hoof.

315
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,259
       Guess it's back to
       the drawing board.

316
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,528
     Well, there will always
     be a place for you here

317
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,630
    if you change your mind.

318
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,831
Hold on. What did
you just say?

319
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,867
                There'll always
                be a place for you here?

320
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,368
   No-no-no-no. Before that.

321
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,736
                  Back to the
                  drawing board?

322
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,238
That was me!

323
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,507
          Nothing brought Mr.
          Sandwich more pleasure

324
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,175
        than seeing the laughter
        his gags brought

325
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,477
           to ponies first hoof?

326
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,813
   YES! That! We've been going
    about this all wrong!

327
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,948
We don't need to
make Cheese laugh.

328
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,184
HE needs to make US laugh!

329
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:21,120
         [zoom]

330
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,323
   Cheese! I figured it out!
   I know why you can't laugh!

331
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:26,991
           What? Why?

332
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,027
    You started this factory
     because you didn't want

333
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,628
to disappoint
smiling faces,

334
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,963
but in here you
can't see any!

335
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,567
      It does make a
       certain sense, sir.

336
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,170
     Spreading laughter has
     always brought you joy.

337
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,273
    But spreading laughter is
     what this factory does.

338
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,109
    Except you don't SEE it.

339
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,844
You're a party pony like me.

340
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,747
You need to make
ponies smile in person!

341
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,886
Here! Just try it!

342
00:15:55,388 --> 00:16:00,824
      OK... Um, why did Boneless 2
        cross the road?

343
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,663
     To prove to Boneless
     1 he wasn't a chicken.

344
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:10,835
Very funny sir. Excellent
joke. Oh! I mean, Ha. Ha, ha?

00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:11,836
             Really..?

346
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,139
Sorry. Not much of a laugher.

Here. Try me. I
promise I'll laugh!

348
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,279
        Pinkie, you laugh
         at everything.

349
