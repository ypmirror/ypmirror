   our power in this amulet.

125
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,923
    You can activate it with
     your magic at any time.

126

    Preferably dawn and dusk.

127
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,395
  Ooh! That's not a terrifying
  level of responsibility

128
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,564
          or anything.

129
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,265
        We won't let you
        down, princesses.

130
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,873
       Please tell me that

131
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,810
    the Royal Swanifying is!?

132
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:02,146
   Apparently, it's a
  celebration of all the swans

133
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,548
       in the royal lake.
        We round 'em up,

134
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,017
       parade 'em through
        the streets,

135
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,119

      party in the castle.

136
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,991
       One question. WHY?

137

       It doesn't matter.

138
