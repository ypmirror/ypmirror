1
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,272
    Spike: It's not every day
    the Princesses pass

2
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:09,108
   all their responsibilities
   on to you and your friends.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,243
    Luna: You wanted to boost
    Twilight's confidence,

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,812
 so you brought back Chrysalis,
 Cozy Glow, and Tirek

5
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,046
         to attack her!?

6
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,549
       Discord was Grogar!?

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,018
     You've been setting up
     challenges for us

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,586
    the whole time,
    haven't you!

9
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:21,587
                    My bad.

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,156
  <i> The ultimate battle for the</i>
   <i> fate of Equestria ...</i>

11
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,257
           <i> is coming!</i>

12
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,693
   Applejack: We'll hold them
    till you get back!

13
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,528
     Discord: Fly, you foal!

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,171
   Cozy Glow: And NOW for your
   complete DESTRUCTION!

15
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,707
       Won't that be FUN?

16
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,776
                 Chrysalis:
                 Patience, Cozy.

17
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,112
             Destruction
             is so... permanent.

18
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,948
       We need to show the
        rest of Equestria

19
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,317
        that we've broken
       their heroes first.

20
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,653
     Besides, we should have
     fun with our guests.

21
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:32,090
No! We should hunt
down Twilight Sparkle.

22
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,859
   As long as she's out
   there, she's dangerous.

23
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,128
Is that big
<i>strong</i> minotaur

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,732
THAT scared of
one little pony? Relax!

25
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,268
    It's not like her friends
    are going anywhere..

26
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,306
  The fools brought the remains
  of my throne to Canterlot

27
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,741
     to protect themselves!

28
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,844
       Those shards block
       their magic.

29
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,282
 Careful. Too close and the
 shards cancel even our powers.

30
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,784
        But on THIS side
        of the cavern,

31
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,921
     we're the most powerful
     beings in Equestria,

32
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:08,259
   thanks to Grogar's Bell.
   Isn't that right... GROGAR?

33
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,299
WHAT are you doing!?

34
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,967
You saw what happened

35
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,469
     when you tried to take
     Discord's chaos magic.

36
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,539
      Yeah, but there's
     alicorn princess magic

37
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,475
        in there now too!

38
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,344
 I could be sooo much more
 powerful if I just could have..

39
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,080
What do you mean
YOU could be?

40
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,851
 Um hello, I'm the best one out
 of all of us, nobody sees me--

41
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,154
       -What are you talking about!?
                 -The best at what!?

42
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,389
This is really bad!

43
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,391
     We gotta find Twilight.

44
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,860
     She's probably already
     figured out some way

45
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,228
    to defeat those monsters.

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,231
     Any idea HOW we get
     out of here to do that?

47
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,934
           Too sticky.

48
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,670
     There's no way anypony
     could get through this.

49
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,840
     Discord: I'm so sorry.

50
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,408
         It made so much
        sense in my head.

51
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,778
        Twilight defeats
        her worst enemies

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,746
        and is filled
        with confidence.

53
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,049
      I truly did have
      the best intentions.

54
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,317
        I swear I'll make
        it up to you.

55
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,222
     THAT'S gonna need to be
     a pretty EPIC make up.

56
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,425
       STAY AWAY FROM THE
       BELL, YOU PEST!

57
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,461
       NONE of us can use
       the alicorn's magic

58
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,197
        until we figure
        out how to handle

59
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,466
     that fool's ridiculous
       chaos magic!

60
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,103
      Discord: I could
      always<i> tell</i> you how...

61
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:28,206
     It would give you
     power over all reality.

62
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,842
         But you'd have
        to ask nicely...

63
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,277
      AND spare my friends.

64
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,980
No, Discord! This
isn't the way to help!

65
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,716
      [baby talk] Discord,
      could you pleeeease...?

66
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,620
Threats are more
my speed. SPEAK!

67
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,023
         He's lying! He
         won't tell us.

68
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,426
         I certainly
         won't tell YOU

69
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,762
   after the way you lied to
   ME last time we teamed up,

70
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,132
     you musclebound cretin.

71
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,467
               This "cretin"
               could destroy you

72
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,237
      before you blink so choose
      your words carefully.

73
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,407
      You're right. "Cretin"
       is too polite.

74
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,611
     How about 'pathetic
     centaur who uses magic

75
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,680
   to compensate for the fact
   that deep down he's afraid

76
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:09,781
      he'll never be enough

77
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,352
       to please dear old
       Dad, King Vorak?

78
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,194
          [laughter] You missed!

79
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,495
    Starlight: Did he, though?

80
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,033
GET HER!

81
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,601
      <i> ♪ [dramatic music] ♪</i>

      No way. She's always
      needed you guys!

85
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:47,689
        Ugh!

86
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,058
Find Twilight! We may
not have our magic,

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,127
but we aren't
<i>completely</i> helpless.

88
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,996
We'll hold them off
as long as we can.

89
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,535
       That... was a
      pretty epic make up!

90
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:07,206
    Just save Equestria! And
    keep Fluttershy safe!

91
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:17,182
       Why are you out
       in the open? HIDE!

92
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,819
Where IS everypony?

93
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,104
        The unicorns have
        been gathering

94
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,488
  in Celestia's School of
  Magic ever since the attack.

95
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,290
     That's where I was
     headed when I saw you!

96
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,326
      What about the earth
      ponies and pegasi?

97
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,828
         It's everypony
         for themselves!

98
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,880
        That ain't right!

99
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,431
     Well, YOU can all stand
     out here and debate.

100
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,133
    I'm going where I'm safe.

101
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,136
       Chrysalis was
       telling the truth!

102
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,638
   They really HAVE turned
   ponies against each other!

103
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:42,641
       Everypony's scared,
       that's all.

104
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:43,843
         We just need to
        get to Ponyville

105
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:45,444
         and find
        Twilight pronto.

106
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,979
       She'll know how to
        set things right.

107
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:54,053
      Please, stay calm.
      I KNOW it seems bad.

108
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,721
         But there's NO
         need to panic!

109
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,791
        GIVE US ONE GOOD
        REASON NOT TO!

110
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,097
     Ah..! Because Ponyville's
     own heroes of Equestria

111
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,732
      are here to save us!

112
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,036
        Where'd all these
        ponies come from?

113
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:15,041
  Earth ponies been pourin' in
  looking for somewhere safe.

114
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,777
      We don't have unicorn
      magic to protect us

115
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,814
 or a city in the sky to hide in
 like those cowardly pegasi...

116
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,115
            Cowardly!?

      <i> ♪ [dramatic music] ♪</i>

118

They're blocking
Cloudsdale!

any "grounded" ponies

 Don't! That's exactly what
 Chrysalis and the others want!

    OH, YOU BETTER FIX THIS!

126
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,039
    Twilight's probably as
    worried as everypony else

127
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,441
       and tryin' to find
       somewhere safe.

128
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,242
 That's why I was sure she'd be
 waitin' for us in Ponyville.

    Where else could she be!?

    Oh! I know where Twilight is!

131
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,785
       Oh! Thank Celestia
      you're all allright.

132
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,989

         It's.. not good.

133
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:09,328
 You're here!? I was so worried!
 Where are the princesses?

134

  we could escape and find you!

      Mission Accomplished!

136
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:18,770
    Now LET'S SAVE
    EQUESTRIA! Woohoo, yeah!

137
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,606

      mistake. You all did!
