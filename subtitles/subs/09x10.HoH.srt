  we brought in the whole
   harvest with time to spare!

418
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,921
      No wonder you were so
       tired all the time!

419
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,156
             Eeyup!

420
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,291
 I'm glad we solved the mystery,

421
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,161
     but I really wanted to
    catch the Great Seedling

422
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,230
  before I get too old to try.

423
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,731
   You know what, sugar cube?

424
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,833
      You're never too
       old to be a filly.

425
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,635
There will always be work to do,

426
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,103
     but having fun together

427
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,171
       is something you
       never grow out of!

428
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,695
         [panting]

429
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,248
     Well, looks like you
     don't need me anymore.

430
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,949
 Time to get home before Dottie

431
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,617
    gets in the catnip again.

432
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,121
      I have stories about
      that. I tell ya what.

433
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,923
        We're real glad
        you came, Goldie.

434
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,692
 Sure are! Come back next year!

435
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,862
            [whistle]

436
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,165
            [meowing]

437
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,638
   Oh! Looks like you forgot
    to clean up the carrots.

438
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,374
     Huh. Big Mac wasn't
     harvesting the carrots....

439
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:17,775
        Just the apples!

440
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:19,824
    Mm-mm.

441
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,215
    You know what this means!?

442
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,218
     Time for another hunt!

443
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:31,242
     Look our Great Seedling! Here we come!
