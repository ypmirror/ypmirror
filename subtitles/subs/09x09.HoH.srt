00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,342
Hiding, and
moping around...

142
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,444
                    I have not!

143
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,745
   Have so!

144
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,314
      Easy, guys. I learned
      at Twilight's school,

145
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,351
 ganging up on each other isn't
 half as cool as you think.

146
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,855
 Aw, Pony school made you soft.

147
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,490
   Wanna try me and find out?

148
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,559
       [gulp] Maybe later.

149
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,962
      So... Let's get lava
      diving! Whaddya say?

150
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,064
Better stay here, shrimp.

151
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,401
Lava might ruin your
blankie-wankie...!

152
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,936
     Let the wimp tag along.

153
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,605
       Then we'll have
       somedragon to dunk! Hahaha!

154
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:25,210
    Hm! Only gonna warn you
    once. Spike's my friend.

155
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,546
       You mess with him,
       you mess with me.

156
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,849
   Besides, he came here to
   hang out with YOU, Garble.

157
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,486
[guffawing]

158
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,189
Aw, how sweet...! Hah!

159
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,958
Let's go do dragon stuff.

160
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,094
Garble can have fun
with his new friend!

161
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,299
            [shouts]

162
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,335
     But I'm not having fun!
     And he's not my friend!

163
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,570
    [groan]

164
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,605
    Yeah just ignore them, GarGar.

165
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,108
Smolder! Not in public!

166
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,510
         Oh, it's OK to
        have a nickname!

167
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,546
      Sometimes I'm
      called Spikey Wikey.

168
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,182
Seriously? You're
admitting this?

169
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,550
I am not hanging
out with him.

170
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,754
 Give him a chance, Garble. You
   guys have a lot in common.

171
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,424
 Ugh. Fine. Race you to the Lava Pit.

172
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,295
    Wait! I thought you said
     your brother was sweet.

173
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,797
All the tough guy
stuff is just an act.

174
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,599
He's a big marshmallow.

175
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,200
            Yeah. Not seeing it.

176
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,603
Well, maybe a
burned marshmallow.

177
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,539
Smoky on the outside,
but squishy inside.

178
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,108
He just needs friends who
can appreciate that part.

179
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,043
     Like you.

180
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,178
 You're not
changing your mind

181
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,313
 about helping me
cheer him up, are you?

182
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,115
                Me? 'Course not!

183
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,751
                     [groan]

184
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,624
   OK! Lava jumping, just
   like old times, huh GarGar?

185
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,392
   Yeah. Just like old times.

186
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,762
     Except for one little,
     <i>annoying</i> thing.

187
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,298
          Scales away!

188
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,366
            [splash]

189
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,036
  Come on in! The lava's fine!

190
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,037
   [groan]

191
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,639
     Ya know, whenever I'm
     feeling a little down,

192
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,075
     it always helps if I do
     something with a friend.

193
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,277
   How about we jump together?

194
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,047
              Agh!

195
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:09,781
            [splash]

196
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:10,882
           [gurgling]

197
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:14,487
Ooooh. Spike? You OK?

198
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,364
          [gasp]

199
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:19,257
 Er. I know there must be something
 worse than lava up your nose.

200
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,261
        Ah ah ah ahchoo!

201
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,464
    I just don't know it is.

202
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,265
          CANNON BALL!

203
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:29,645
           Agh! [splash]

204
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,636
        Woohoo! Ha ha ha!

205
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,571
              Oops..!

206
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,444
            [choking]

207
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:43,783
   SWALLOWING lava. Swallowing
   lava is definitely worse.

208
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,151
   My bad.

209
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,258
     And then they all lived
      happily ever after!

210
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,227
 Time to come out, little ones!

211
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,133
           [baby talk]

212
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,503
    Maybe you'd like a song?

213
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,906
  I think you might be
  encouraging them to stay in.

214
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,509
Dragons aren't much for
touchy-feely stuff.

215
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,810
                  Oh. I'm sorry.

216
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,812
           [crackling]

217
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,514
        Goodness! Why are
        the eggs shaking?

218
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,583
   [gasp] Are they finally hatching?

219
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,219
I wish. They've been
doing that for days.

220
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,088
I'm sure it means something.
But it's probably not good.

221
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,692
      Try this. Red velvet.

222
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,894
     Guaranteed to brighten
     anycreature's spirits!

224
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,965
     Feeling better already.

225
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,269
     I don't know about you,
     but a change of scenery

226
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,705
       always turns my
       frown upside down.

227
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:41,472
              AAh!

             [thud]

    I will be the bigger dragon.
    I will be the bigger dragon.

230
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,549
I will be the bigger dragon.
I will be the bigger dragon.

231
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,085
   Sometimes just hearing what
  someone appreciates about you

232
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,654
     can make you feel
     better about yourself.

233
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,089
I'll go first.

234
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,226
        Spike, I think
        it's really nice

235
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,628
       that you're trying
       to cheer up GarGar.

236
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,963
                       Agh...!

237
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,966
Thank you, Smolder.
  My turn.

238
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,834
I like how you always
let everycreature know

239
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,503
   how you're feeling, GarGar.

240
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,506
               ONLY SMOLDER GETS
               TO CALL ME THAT!

00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,643

      speaking your truth...!

   OK, NEW activity. Who wants
    to make vision boards?

248
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:39,030
Hey, Garble! Smolder! Surf's up!

249
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:42,778
         [splashing]

250
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,136
 Let ME show you how it's done!

251
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,206
                     You coming?

252
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,409
I'll.. catch up with you.

00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,249
Ah Spike! There
you are!

256
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,551
        Hey, Fluttershy.

257
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:00,952
For a land that's
 all rocks,

258
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,022
this place is surprisingly
 easy to get lost in.

259
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,690
 How are the baby dragons doing?

260
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:09,260
     The eggs won't hatch!
     They just keep shaking.

261
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,763
    I'm starting to think the
    dragons are too scared

262
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,033
   to come out. I was
    hoping you could help...

263
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,534
     ...If you're not too busy

264
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,203
 cheering up Smolder's brother.

265
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,807
     Not a chance. Smolder's
     brother is GARBLE.

266
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:22,584
[gasp]

267
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,177
 The only thing that cheers him
  up is to make me miserable.

268
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,447
        Hey, Spike! Wanna
        play lava ball?

269
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:31,071
Huh!?

270
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,854
Excuse me! But that's
not a very nice game.

271
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,257

Ah, nearly got you!

00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,796
             ENOUGH!!

275
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,068
      Ahem. I mean, leave my
      friend alone, please.

276
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,238
     Spike came all this
     way to cheer up Garble,

277
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,840
        which was a very
        kind thing to do.

278
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,776
Aw, do you need
cheering up?

279
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,378
What's wrong, Garble?

280
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,749
Did somedragon hurt
your wittle feewings?

      No! I don't know what
      she's talking about!

282
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,254
Spike's the one who's gonna cry!

283
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:12,223
        HEY! Are we lava
        surfing or what?

284
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,627
    Uh yeah! Yeah! Let's go
    hang with a REAL dragon.

285

00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,629
   But my friends have taught
    me to celebrate them!

427
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,543
     [agreeing growls]

428
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,168
 And from now on, in my kingdom,

429
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,604
 that's exactly what we will do!

430
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,306
      Now, if you don't
     mind, can you teach me

431
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,009
    how to write poetry like
     that? It's pretty cool.

432
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:21,245
   Uh, yeah. Sure, no problem!

433
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,813
Yeah, me too!

434
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,615
I wanna learn!

435
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,351
      Take a number, guys.

436
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,821
   I'll take them all! Oh, my!
