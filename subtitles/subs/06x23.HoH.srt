Well, that's the last
of it, Filthy Rich.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,485
Just Rich, please. And on behalf
of Rich's Barnyard Bargains,

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,090
thanks for another season's
shipment of Zap Apple Jam.

5
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:19,265
Our pleasure. See
ya next time!

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,445
Uh, Apple Bloom? Did you pack up
the cider into the same crates

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,915
as the Zap Apple Jam?

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,420
Sure did! Now that
I'm getting older,

9
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:33,885
I want to prove I can handle
more responsibility on the farm.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,815
But the crates aren't marked.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,650
You kept track of what when
into which crate, right?

12
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:43,755
Oh. Um... Yep. I totally
kept track of everything.

13
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:47,745
Good. Because we wouldn't want
Filthy Rich to get a shipment

14
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,675

to get Zap Apple Jam.

anywhere but
on the farm.

17
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:57,195
Are you sure he
got the right crates?

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,440
Sure, I'm sure!

#APPLEJACK2016 - MAKE CIDER ALCOHOLIC AGAIN!
https://yp1.yayponies.eu

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,740
Granny knows I wasn't trying
to make off with a shipment

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,370
of cider, right? Because
I would never do that.

28
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,105
Don't worry. We know
exactly whose fault it was.

29
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,560
Now, why in tarnation would
you lie to me, Apple Bloom?

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,335
I was kinda hoping I could fix
it before anypony found out.

31
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:24,450
Telling lies won't fix
anything. Trust me, I know.

32
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,245
What could you
possibly know about it?

33
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,730
You've never told a
lie in your whole life.

34
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,485
[laughing]

35
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:36,585
What's so funny?

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,105
Oh, sugar cube, your
big sister lied so much

37
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:44,895
when she was a filly, the whole
family ended up in the hospital.

38
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,010
WHAT?!

39
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,315
Eeyup.

40
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,945
[sigh] You might as well
tell her the whole story.

41
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:52,350
It might even do
her some good.

42
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,650
When Applejack and Big Mac
were just a wee bit older

43
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,315
than you are now, they
both kept squabblin' over

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,425
who would run
the farm better.

45
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:07,660
All I'm sayin' is that you
may have plenty of brawn,

46
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:10,120
but I'm the one with the
ideas on how to run things

47
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,220
better around here.

48
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,940
Applejack, Applejack,
Applejack.

49
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:15,775
Ideas are all
well and good,

50
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,985
but you can't plow
a field with them.

51
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:20,975
I don't know how many
times I've told you that.

52
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,915
Too many!

53
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,870
You two horned toads better stop
jabberin' and get to workin'!

54
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:28,885
Yeah they'd better! I
need you to go to town.

55
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:32,330
The apple blight's been awful
and if we don't get more spray,

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,310
cider season'll be shorter
than a dwarf crab-apple tree.

57
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:36,450
[growl]

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,725
Like I was just telling
cousin Braeburn last week;

59
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:41,695
now there's a pony who knows how
to put his back into a problem.

60
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:43,675
[growl]

61
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:45,920
Oh hi there, Filthy Rich!

62
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:47,705
Just Rich, please.

63
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,635
And I'd like you to meet
my fiancée, Spoiled Milk.

64
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:54,175
Honey, this is
Applejack and Big Mac,

65
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:57,225
the two hardest-working
ponies at Sweet Apple Acres.

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,835
You work on a farm?
How... quaint.

67
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,195
Oh ho now,
dear, be nice.

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,615
Sweet Apple Acres
makes Zap Apple Jam.

69
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,885
It's one of Dad's
best-sellers.

70
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:13,225
You mean one of
your best-sellers.

71
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,440
My amazing husband-to-be
is running the

72
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:19,895
Rich family business now. Did
you know that? Well, now you do.

73
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,920
Don't mind Spoiled Milk.
She's just proud of me.

74
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:27,065
But she's right; I'm in
charge of the store now

75
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,105
and I'm just bursting
with ideas I wanna try.

76
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:31,290
Like what?

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,570
Well, how about this? Cider
season's around the corner.

78
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,930
Why not let me
sell it for you?

79
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,655
That is an
interesting idea.

80
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,555
Well, maybe it's interesting
and maybe it ain't,

81
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,775
but it's definitely
not a new idea.

82
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:48,345
Granny Smith told us your
grandpa, Stinkin' Rich,

83
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:50,670
used to ask her every year
if he could sell our cider

84
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:53,350
in your store, and Granny
told him every year

85
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,625
about the tradition of
everypony in Ponyville

86
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,590
lining up out at
Sweet Apple Acres.

87
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,920
So, start a new tradition!

88
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,350
Someday one of you'll
take over the farm

89
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,775
just like I've taken
over the store.

90
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,900
I'm guessing it'll be the
one with the best ideas.

91
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:12,260
Well, now, as I've said
many a time before,

92
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,495
ideas are all well and good,
but you can't plow a field--

93
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,335
You know what? How about
we give you three barrels

94
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,720
of cider early, and
if it sells well,

95
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,185
we'll make a deal
for the rest.

96
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,680
Oh, hey now! Perfect!

97
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,935
Come on, honey. I've got
to get everything ready.

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,305
Hoo-wee, I tell ya, if the
future means me running

99
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,710
Sweet Apple Acres and you
being quiet, I can't wait!

100
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,695
I just can't believe you'd
make a deal with Filthy Rich

101
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,405
without even talking to Granny.

102
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,480
Aw, Granny will love the
idea and then she'll decide

103
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,645
that I'm the one who should
take over the farm. You'll see.

104
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:52,115
Granny: See what?

105
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:56,525
Applejack here had another
one of her "big ideas,"

106
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,295
and I think we all know my
position on ideas, you...

107
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,875
...can't plow a
field with them.

108
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,500
Eey... Right.

109
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,550
Big idea, huh?

110
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,775
Actually, more of
an opportunity.

111
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:12,420
You see, we ran into
Filthy Rich in town.

112
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,365
Did you know he's running
the family store now?

113
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:16,965
And what does this
here "opportunity"

114
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:19,215
mean for Sweet
Apple Acres?

115
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,195
Well, since cider season is
almost here, he or, I mean,

116
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:27,955
I thought it'd be a good idea to
give him a few barrels of cider

117
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,220
to sell at the store
before the season starts.

118
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:32,315
Oh, is that all?

119
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,075
Absolutely not!

120
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,965
Hmmm.

121
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:44,940
But Granny, why can't we sell
a few barrels of cider early

122
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:48,135
to Filthy Rich? How's it any
different than when you gave

123
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,820
Zap Apple Jam to Filthy's
grandpappy to sell?

124
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,560
Your cider and your jam
ain't the same thing!

125
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,520
Zap Apple Jam jars preserve
the flavor for moons,

126
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,560
but cider starts to spoil

127
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,510
the second it comes
out of the press.

128
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,395
That is why every cider season,
all of Ponyville lines up

129
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,865
at Sweet Apple Acres and first
come is first served. Hmm!

130
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:11,200
I get what you're
saying, Granny,

131
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,345
but couldn't you make an
exception just this once?

132
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:16,410
I sorta promised.

133
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,145
Meh-eh. Besides, cider-makin'
is iffy business.

134
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,730
And we're probably not gonna
have a lot this year anyway,

135
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:25,915
what with all the blight.

136
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,700
I'm sorry, Applejack, but
you'll have to un-promise.

137
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:32,380
Oh!

138
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,270
I hate to say I told
you so, Applejack, but--

139
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:40,655
You and I both know you
don't hate to say anything.

140
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,685
Well, I've always thought
that the most important thing

141
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:46,070
a pony can do is say
exactly what's on his mind

142
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,575
to anypony who'll listen
so everypony everywhere

143
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,930
always knows everything
you're thinking and...

144
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,765
And you don't ever have to
listen to anypony else.

145
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:54,700
What?

146
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,620
Exactly.

147
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,715
Well, if it ain't my
new business partner!

148
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,365
Um, about the
cider, Rich...

149
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,110
Take a look at what I did last
night after we made our deal.

150
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,950
Woo! Pretty great, huh?

151
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:16,455
The thing is, I don't
think I can get you any.

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,220
What?! But I did all
this work on your say-so.

153
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,140
We shook hooves and
everything.

154
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,325
Well, you see, at
Sweet Apple Acres,

155
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,690
we've always been about quality
and while your basic jam jar'll-

156
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:30,705
Plus it's been a tough
harvest this year,

157
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,155
what with all the
blight.

158
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:36,115
Sounds to me like you're
trying to make excuses.

159
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,615
Whenever Granddad dealt with
Granny Smith, she kept her word.

160
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:43,385
If you can't do that,
then maybe our families

161
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:46,830
should stop doing business
together. Altogether!

162
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,490
Now, now, the thing is, Rich,
it ain't really up to us.

163
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,025
You see, Granny's--

164
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,795
--sick!

165
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,450
Wait. Granny's
sick? I had no idea!

166
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:01,075
Eey... Yeah, nopony did.

167
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,725
What Big Mac means is we've
been trying to keep it quiet.

168
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,665
We don't want people
to make rash decisions

169
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,560
about doing business
with Sweet Apple Acres

170
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,480
just because we're a little
short-hooved at the moment.

171
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:17,280
Oh my! Of course, of
course. I am so sorry.

172
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,835
Please let me know if
there's anything I can do.

173
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:24,625
Much appreciated. But
right now, we only ask

174
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,695
for your understanding
during this difficult time.

175
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,225
Mm hm.

176
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,525
Big Mac: You were supposed to
tell Rich the simple truth,

177
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:36,155
but instead you made things
worse with a giant lie!

178
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,590
Well, what was I supposed
to do? You heard Rich.

179
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,335
If I told him the truth, he
was gonna stop doing business

180
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,475
with us altogether.

181
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,230
Yeah, but that's
only because--

182
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,720
--I forgot to ask if we
had any oat crumbles

183
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,090
for this delicious-looking
salad, Granny!

184
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:53,615
I'll go take a look.

185
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,980
--that was only because you made
promises you couldn't keep,

186
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,915
but there's gotta be a
better way out of this mess

187
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:02,815
than by making up some story
about Granny being sick!

188
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,215
Well, it worked, didn't it?

189
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,390
[knock at door]

190
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,750
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

191
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:12,585
We just wanted to come by to
wish Granny a speedy recovery.

192
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,425
Look, sis, our good friend Mr.
Rich and his fiancée are here.

193
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,075
Oh, and they brought
flowers. For Granny.

194
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,115
On account of she's sick, like
you said. Ain't that sweet?

195
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,570
Uh, excuse me one second!

196
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:30,900
[slam]

197
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,005
[crash]

198
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,915
What in tarnation?!

199
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:37,730
Oh, I'm sorry, Granny.
I didn't see you there.

200
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,630
You came blasting in so fast,

201
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,640
t'weren't possible
to see nothin'!

202
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:43,665
Can you go out to the barn?

203
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:46,280
I, uh, I think we might
have left a blight sprayer

204
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:47,135
in the orchard.

205
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,720
Are you outta your apple-pickin'
mind? It's suppertime, girl!

206
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,205
I know, but if we
forgot a sprayer,

207
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,925
I'd wanna get it before
dark. You go start counting

208
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,740
and I'll tell Big Mac
we'll be right back, OK?

209
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:00,550
[slam]

210
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,550
So from that moment on, I
took to referring to myself

211
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:06,925
as Big or Large or--

212
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,555
Oh Applejack, your brother
was just explaining

213
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,895
why he always wears his yoke.

214
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,665
Even though we asked him how
your grandmare is doing.

215
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,905
Oh, you know how Big
Mac can get to talking,

216
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,365
especially when he's
upset. And right now,

217
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:25,280
he's just as worried about
Granny Smith as I am.

218
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:26,505
[door closes]

219
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,795
Oh dear. Is she doing that bad?

220
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,225
Well, one thing's for sure,

221
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,530
she shouldn't be seeing
anypony right now.

222
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:39,425
In fact, I'm getting more
upset just thinking about it.

223
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,745
Excuse me!

224
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,190
[crash]

225
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,875
Oh, what in the frilly
fumidila has gotten into you?!

226
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,065
Sorry, Granny! I just
decided if I helped you,

227
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,535
it would go faster.

228
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,655
Well, you're too late.
All the sprayers are here.

229
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,630
Oh, good. Uh say, Granny,

230
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:03,240
when did you first fight
the apple blight again?

231
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,040
It was my second year
here in Ponyville

232
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:12,620
and that was before I had
the rick on the one knee.

233
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:16,565
...and others say that's how the
trees got to growing so tall,

234
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,680
but to me, it's just
how I got my cutie mark.

235
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:23,580
But we asked when we could
come back to see Granny!

236
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:26,105
Big Mac didn't
want to be rude,

237
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:30,455
but you just can't see Granny
right now because she's...

238
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,675
...got apple blight!

239
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,215
[gasp] I thought only
trees got the blight.

240
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,415
Yeah, that's
usually the case.

241
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,465
The doctors think it's from
working in the orchard

242
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,840
for so many years.

243
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:48,920
You see. We had to take
Granny to Ponyville General.

244
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,420
We just got back right
before you showed up.

245
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:54,555
Oh my, that is terrible!

246
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:57,810
Eww, it's not
contagious, is it?

247
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:01,330
Um, I'm sure you'll be
fine, but you should leave,

248
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:03,355
[cough] just in case.

249
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,315
You're right. We're gonna have
to hurry if we want to get there

250
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,390
before visiting hours are over.

251
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,420
That's right. Wait. Get where?

252
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:15,840
Why, the hospital, of course.

253
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:17,925
I'm sure we'll see you there!

254
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,970
Telling Filthy Rich that
Granny's in the hospital

255
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,135
just made everything
a hundred times worse!

256
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,915
What are we supposed to do now?

257
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:31,965
I got it!

258
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,775
...dropped my second best
teeth right in the pig pen

259
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:40,300
and that was the worst case of
apple blight I've ever seen!

260
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,965
I'd love to hear
more Granny,

261
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,110
but we gotta get to the
hospital right away!

262
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,295
The hospital?
Why, who's sick?

263
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,225
You are, apparently.

264
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,065
What he means is, you're
needed at the hospital.

265
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,075
Whatever for?

266
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,880
It's the apple blight! It's
starting to infect ponies now!

267
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,415
The doctors need an expert
opinion, and nopony knows more

268
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,720
about fighting blight
than Granny Smith!

269
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:09,820
Well, what in tarnation are
we waiting for? Let's go!

270
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,540
You know, we're supposed
to go in the back.

271
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:24,955
Uh, to avoid anypony in the
waiting room with the blight.

272
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,685
Oops, I almost forgot!

273
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:35,145
This is perfect.

274
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,785
Now you don't have to worry
about catching the blight.

275
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,790
If you say so, dearie.

276
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,660
Now you wait right here while
I... check on your presentation.

277
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,295
What in the rotten
rhubarb's going on here?

278
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,065
Fancy meeting you two here!

279
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,810
Well, we told you
we were coming.

280
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:57,785
Oh, I'm glad we found you
because I can't seem to find

281
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,905
Granny's room, or any
nurses who've even heard

282
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,930
about a pony with
apple blight.

283
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:06,705
Granny's room. Sure. Just
go down here, take a left,

284
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,615
then a right, go down some
stairs, up a bunch more stairs,

285
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:11,670
through the cafeteria,
left three more times

286
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,775
and then you're there. Easy as
Granny's apple pie! Heh heh.

287
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:18,400
Aren't you coming with us?

288
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:21,080
I'll catch up! I
gotta find Big Mac.

289
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:26,260
OK, Granny, just wait here
one second and we can go.

290
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:28,280
Where are you
two going?

291
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,190
Big Mac can't come.
He, uh...

292
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:31,720
...might be contagious.

293
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,440
Both: Contagious?

294
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,425
All right. Climb up here
and I'll cover you up.

295
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,655
Then I'll bring Rich in,
tell him you're Granny,

296
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,355
but you're not allowed
to take the sheets off.

297
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:44,965
You moan a few times, he leaves,
and this whole thing is over.

298
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,895
This is spinnin' way out
of control, Applejack!

299
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,480
Now I know you thought selling
cider in Filthy's store

300
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:53,425
was a good idea, but it
ain't worth lying to him

301
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,235
about Granny being sick and
needin' to go to the hospital,

302
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,165
or fibbin' to Granny about
them wanting her to come here

303
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,695
to talk about the blight, or--

304
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:04,165
BIG MACINTOSH, PLEASE JUST
LISTEN TO ME FOR ONCE!

305
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,380
This ain't about my ideas!

306
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,535
If Rich finds out
about all the lies,

307
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,145
he'll cut ties with us and
the farm will go under.

308
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,065
Now do you want that to
happen or do you wanna help?

309
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:16,325
Why can't you be Granny?
You're her size,

310
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:17,755
and this is all your fault
in the first place!

311
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,685
I would, but if I let
you do the talkin',

312
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,210
you'd just ramble on and on
until we all got caught.

313
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,185
[groan]

314
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:27,700
Just lay down, keep still

315
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,900
and promise me you won't say
anything for once in your life.

316
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,660
Eeyup.

317
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,005
Granny!

318
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:40,545
Granny.

319
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:44,290
It's about time. What
is going on around here?

320
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,980
Granny, they need you to wait
here. I'll come get you.

321
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,180
[door slam]

322
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:53,160
There you are! We've
been going in circles

323
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:54,800
looking for Granny's room!

324
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,360
Well, you're in luck, 'cause
it's, it's right over here

325
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,850
and this time I'll make
sure you don't get lost.

326
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,530
[wheel squeaking]

327
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,745
What in the dadgum?

328
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,810
What now?

329
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,235
He-- I mean, "she"
was right here!

330
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,585
Oh no! We gotta go!

331
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,760
[squeaking wheel]

332
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:20,085
Is that
Granny Smith?

333
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,120
Where are they
taking her?

334
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,330
You two, don't lose
that gurney!

335
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,475
Granny, what're you doin'? You
were supposed to stay there!

336
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,935

Oh! Uh, well, OK, come
with me, but be quiet.

I'm sorry, but you can't get any
closer without a gown and mask.

But-- but-but that's
my brother on there!

Don't worry. This
is our best doctor.

She'll have your brother back
on his hooves in no time.

Now, apple blight is
a serious disease.

347
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:25,215
Now then? Did she say
"apple blight?"

348
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,985
I think she said
"gasket mites."

349
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,680
And once the trunk
turns red like this,

350
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,975
the only thing to do
is prune the branches.

351
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,695
Oh no! Granny!

352
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,820
Did you say "prune
the branches?"

Well, sure. What
else you gonna do

354
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,575
once the blight
gets this bad?

Everypony just stop!

357
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,675
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

358
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:03,955
Actually, it's a big lie!

going on here, Applejack?

That is a darn
good question.

362
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,395
I'm not sure if I was worried
that nopony was listening

363
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:24,410
to my ideas or just nervous
that I wouldn't be the one

364
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:25,880
to end up running the farm,

365
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,240
but I promised
something to Filthy Rich

366
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,330
that I couldn't deliver and I
was too embarrassed to admit it.

367
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,735
So Granny was never sick?

368
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,110
And there ain't no
apple blight in ponies?

369
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,510
Nope!

370
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,785
Those were all lies. And I
thought if you found out,

371
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:46,210
you'd stop doing
business with the farm,

372
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:48,675
so I just kept
telling more.

373
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,015
So, she's not a doctor?

374
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:54,570
Please don't make Granny and
the farm suffer for what I did.

375
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,985
This whole thing is my fault.

376
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,060
That's not
entirely true.

377
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,470
Maybe if I paid more attention
to what you had to say

378
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,055
instead of talking
all the time,

379
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,380
none of this would have
happened in the first place.

380
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:10,015
I just need to talk
less and listen more...

381
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,670
Especially to you.

382
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,900
Thanks, big brother.

And whether it's me running
Sweet Apple Acres or you,

I know it'll be in good hooves.

385
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:22,215
Well, that's nice, but I
don't know what in blazes

386
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:23,520
you two are talking about.

387
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,545
I ain't going anywhere anytime
soon. Pfft! Running the farm.

388
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,920
Not after this
display. Not likely.

389
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,655
And don't you go getting any
ideas about "cutting ties"

390
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,025
with Sweet Apple Acres, or I'm
goin right to your grandpappy.

391
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:40,820

[AHEM] Um... Yes, ma'am.

00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:48,050
Now, who here still wants to
hear about the apple blight?

394
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:51,180
Now when I was a filly...

395
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,320
I can't believe you
told all those lies!

396
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,750
It's not a story I'm
proud of,

397
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,650
but it taught me a lifelong
lesson about being honest.

398
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,910
I hope you learned
something too.

399
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:06,815
I sure did! I learned that
no pony starts out perfect

400
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,240
and sometimes you gotta
make a few mistakes

401
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,600
to figure out who you are.

402
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,065
Eeyup!

403
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:14,535
But I think the most
important thing I learned

404
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,620
is who really runs
Sweet Apple Acres...

405
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,665
Granny!

406
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,920
Yer darn tootin'! Now everypony
quit yer lolly-gaggery

407
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,430
and get back to work. Right
after we have a glass of cider!
