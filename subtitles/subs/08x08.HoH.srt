286
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:31,776
              And <i>she</i> refuses
               to buy our books.

287
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,180
[all together]
Surely this is a
  friendship problem.

288
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,386
It needs to be a real
friendship problem!

289
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,954
You can't just make one up!

290
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:43,988
URGH!

291
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,226
      This is what happens
     when we don't rehearse!

292
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,127
              UGH.

293
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,031
           Starlight?

294
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,299
            Sweetie?

295
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:59,069
   I found a really old town
  bylaw that nopony agrees on.

296
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,506
      Apparently, we're not
       supposed to prance

297
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,074
   or canter after dinnertime.

298
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,710
   Could that be the problem?
       Sillyfilly?

299
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
              Phew.

300
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,683
             What are you doing?

301
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,785
[sigh] Hiding from my mother.

302
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,921
She started making up friendship
problems for me to solve.

303
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,124
           Oh.. My dad won't even let
            me talk to anypony,

304
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:24,129
  in case they're "strangers."
   I'm A GROWN MARE!

00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,414
         [sigh]

306
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,498
We're never going to find
the friendship problem

307
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,335
with them around,
let alone solve it.

308
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,605
Maybe you two should start
looking for it on your own?

             [click]

311
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,515
 OK, so we wanted to talk to all
  of you, you know, in private.

312
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,752
       Just to see if there were
       issues any of you had

313
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,787
              with your friends.

314
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:50,288
             Got it.

315
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,390
       Just one question.

316
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,258
     Why are we whispering?

317
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,529
 They're avoiding their parents.

318
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,764
   Ohhh!

319
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,766
      [murmured agreement]

320
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,334
               No. Not avoiding.

321
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,103
            Just.. taking a break.

322
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,039
              Yeah...

323
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,874
  We needed to focus, but we're
  definitely not avoiding them.

324
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,145
      So you're whispering
       with all of us

325
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,947
      in the darkest corner
        of the shop,

326
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,016
        where nopony can
          possibly see

327
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,284
         because you're
       <i>not</i> avoiding them?

328
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,187
                  Mm-hmm!

329
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,956
    Er.. but they definitely can't
     hear us in here, right?

330
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,291
     No way!

331
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,125
 This is the
antiquities section.

332
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,495
Nopony ever comes
   back here.

            Firelight: There you are!

00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,666
But what are you doing in here?

335
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,336
        [gasp] Is the
       friendship problem

336
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,771

      of the book store?

338
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,612
...and then I
thought the best way

339
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,114
    to look for a friendship
    problem in the present...

                   Oh. Finally.

345
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,193
   Now, I know you don't want
   me to "make up" a problem,

346
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,063
    but what if I START one?

347
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,399
That's not how this...

348
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,067
   I mean, no pony ever became
     a success by following

349
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,736
      all the rules, right?

                  How are things
                   on your end?

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,139

   be grateful for our help.

     possibly have for that?

BECAUSE YOU'RE DRIVING US CRAZY!

       And just how am I
       driving you crazy?

00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,882
 By always coming up with plans!

I don't need a plan!

I mean, maybe I do, but
it'll be mine, not yours!

369
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,260
        Well, I'm sorry
       for trying to help!

            [sobbing]

371
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,098
   And you're not any better.

372
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,167
        I'm not a filly.

373
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,571
 I'm a grown pony with a job to
  do and I'll do it on my own.

374
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,742
       Well, I'll let you
        get to it, then.

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,614
                  Great...

376
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,849
  Now we have to smooth things
    over with our parents

377
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,784
  on top of finding and solving
   a friendship problem.

378
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,255
It's almost like our
relationship with our parents

379
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,957
is the friendship problem.

380

              that's it, do you?

00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,062
That's what all
of us think.

                       Agh!

385
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:51,935
 Why couldn't we have been sent
   to stop a war or something?

386
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,044
                          Dad?

387
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,146
Hello, Ms. Glimmer.

388
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,148
How is your friendship
problem search going?

389
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,350
       I only ask as an
      interested observer,

390
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,486
     since I know you are an
       adult who's capable

391
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,522
     of doing things without
     help from anypony else.

392
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:17,262
  Actually, I think Sunburst
  and I figured out what it is.

393
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,632
    So, Stellar and I weren't
    really helpful after all.

394
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,835
              Well, we haven't
             actually solved it.

395
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,637
       And I don't think we can.

396
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,272
                Not without you.

397
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,344
             [hiss]

398
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,681
           [coughing]

399
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:37,917
            Pungent!

400
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,153
       Oh, did you come by
       to be driven crazy

401
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,589
 by more of your mother's plans?

402
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,125
    No, I came to apologize.

403
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,895
    Well, it's going to take
    more than an apology

404
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,397
    to make up for telling me
     you don't want my help

405
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,266
finding your friendship problem.

406
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,235
   Oh, I'm not sorry for that.

407
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,303
 Starlight and I already figured
    out what the problem is.

408
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,772
   This is a terrible apology.

409
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,543
     Well, if you come with
       me and help fix it,

410
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,011
   I'll give you a better one.

411
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,583
  Usually, Twilight or one of
  our other friends gets called

412
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,519
     to a place with a
   friendship problem to fix.

413
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,722
       But Starlight and I
      realized we came here

414
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,591
     to fix a friendship
     problem we already had.

415
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,661
       I'm sorry I've been
   avoiding coming home, Dad,

416
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,565
     but you can't keep
    treating me like a foal.

417
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,300
      I'm sorry, Sugarbun!

418
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,869
            [sigh] [chuckle]

419
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,273
 I just know how hard things
were for you when you left home.

420
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:40,245
 I guess I wanted you to feel
 safe, like when you were young.

421
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,780
              Dad, I know I've
             made some mistakes,

422
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,715
               and I'll probably
              make a bunch more,

423
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,551
          but I learn from them.

I'm sorry I never told you how
much your plans bothered me,

426
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,561
and I know you just
want me to succeed,

427
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,863
but I need to do
that on my own.

428
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,998
         I remember how
          lost you were

429
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,534
      when you flunked out
        of magic school.

00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,003
       I thought as long
       as you had a plan,

431
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,639
        you'd never feel
         that way again.

432
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,774
  You don't have to worry, Mom.

433
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,609
   I need to find my own way,

434
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,245
     but I definitely don't
       feel lost anymore.

       It's so beautiful!

 The glowing cutie mark is such
   a symbol of accomplishment.

I don't suppose
there's a way for you

 to get it to glow all the time.

     Heh heh. Pretty sure it
     doesn't work that way.

       your parents; we're

      will you visit more?

           Absolutely.

      drive me crazy again,

      I'll tell you instead

     I can always visit you.

I might have a few
