 for letting me borrow your
 Daring Do books! I love them.

Wait till you get to "Daring Do
and the Riddle of the Sphinx!"

4
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,485
      This is actually my
      second time through!

5
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:20,820
      I've read them all,

6
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:22,988
      from "Daring Do and
      the Sapphire Statue"

      Fallen Idol!"

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,794
      Fallen Idol? That's
      not in the series.

9
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,330
Oh, it just came
out last week...

10
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,599
Maybe that's why you
haven't heard of it?

11
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:38,237
              No way Daring Do's
              biggest fan, ME,

12
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,805
                would miss a

13
