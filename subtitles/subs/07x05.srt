1
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,620
        Oooo, be careful!

2
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,777
               Oh!

3
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,512
       Are you OK, Angel?

4
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,487
  I told you that entering the
   Ponyville Paw-Kour contest

5
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,823
      was a dangerous idea.

6
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:01,693
You just rest here and I'll have
  you all fixed up in no time.

7
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,196
               ♪♪

8
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,067
      Oh, dear. I'm all out
      of bunny foot braces.

9
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,470
     I think we need to pay
      a visit to Dr. Fauna.

10
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:29,421
       I was sure that she
      would be here today.

11
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,525
    Hello? Is anypony there?

12
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:37,262
       Fluttershy? Oh, am
       I glad to see you!

13
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,701
  I wish I could say the same,
    but the door is stuck so,

14
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,536
     I um... can't see you.

15
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,578
  Ooh. Somebunny hurt his foot!

16
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,581
      Let's bandage that up
    so he can get back home.

17
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,350
 I'd like to keep him overnight,
       but as you can see

18
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,720
        my place is just
     bursting with animals.

19
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:05,190
I don't think I can take in even
   one more critter right now.

20
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,830
         Both: Oh, dear.

21
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,224
You really have your
hooves full here.

22
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,226
    This place is like a zoo!

23
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,531
    Then again, it's normally
     like that but still...

24
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,732
I can't keep up!

25
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,911
Now does my favorite wittle
bunny want a carrot-pop?

26
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,952
  That's OK. I think the goats
    ate all of them, anyway.

27
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,924
I just can't believe all these
poor little animals are hurt!

28
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,693
What happened?

29
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,793
                  I'm flummoxed!

30
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,664
   Every day, there's more and
  more animals on my doorstep.

31
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,633
        Most of them just
      have minor ailments:

32
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,102
       hurt wings, stuffy
         noses and such.

33
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,639
    But the trouble is, even
  after they're all healed up,

34
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,577
    I can't seem to get these
    comfy critters to leave!

35
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,379
  Oh, dear!

36
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,587
They do seem to have made
themselves right at home here.

37
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,892
         I wonder why they chose
         to flock to my office.

38
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,695
                 It just doesn't
                   make sense.

39
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,931
Don't be silly, Dr. Fauna.

40
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,533
You're the best Vet
Pony in Equestria!

41
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,370
At least that's what I've
been telling everypony.

42
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,005
            Ah, you did what?

43
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:40,679
   Oh, no! Do you suppose it's
     my fault? I'm so sorry;

44
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,648
        I didn't mean for
         this to happen.

45
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,851
  I just know animals feel safe
   and happy under your care.

46
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,724
   Normally, I don't mind if a
    snake wants to slither in

47
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,361
 or a raccoon needs a rest. But
   now this place is so full,

48
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,498
    I have no space to treat
      any injured animals!

49
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,068
     That is a big problem.

50
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,971
        That I'm going to
          fix for you!

51
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,906
       I already have the
        perfect solution

52
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:11,810
    that'll make the critters
 happy and give you more space!

53
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,346
      Then you'll have all
      your ducks in a row.

54
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,953
       The sooner you fix
         it, the better!

55
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,923
                     I'm on it.

56
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,962
     I want to thank you all

57
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,864
        for rushing right
       over when I called.

58
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:40,539
     Dr. Fauna needs my help
     with a serious problem.

59
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,939
      A friendship problem?

60
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:46,912
     No. Her vet clinic is a
     bit maybe um... overrun

61
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:50,515
    with adorable critters in
    dire need of a safe place

62
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,851
    to lay their heads and...

63
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,488
       ... they don't have
         anywhere to go!

64
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,890
          Oh, that's just awful.

65
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,525
    I know!

66
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,762
        Yeah, Dr. Fauna's
     always fixin' Winona up

67
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,263
         when she ain't
        feelin' too fine,

68
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,832
       so helpin' her out
         is A-OK by me.

69
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,067
                           Yeah!

70
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,273
  That's great news because it
 means you'll all be helping me

71
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,342
  with something special, too.

72
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:21,346
  Something that's been a dream
    of mine for a long time.

73
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,515
Oh, goody! Is your dream
to make a bouncy castle

74
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,884
shaped like a
gigantic bundt cake?

75
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,887
                      Um, no...
                    not exactly.

76
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,922
        Oh, just me then.

77
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:34,025
         So what is it,
       Fluttershy? Spill!

78
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,496
     My dream is to build a
     real animal sanctuary.

79
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:42,967
 A beautiful habitat where every
     animal, whether sick...

80
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,235
          or scared...

81
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,571
      or even just lonely.

82
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,074
       Feathered or furry,
         scaly or slimy,

83
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,977
 every critter would be welcome.

84
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,014
     My sanctuary can be the
     one place in Equestria

85
00:06:56,016 --> 00:07:00,084
  they call home till they feel
   ready to take on the world.

86
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,489
        Wow, Fluttershy.

87
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,491
   I've never heard you speak
      with such conviction.

88
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,194
That was exquisite!

89
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,796
         Pretty awesome.

90
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,998
           Thank you, everypony.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,835
    You've all taught me so much
    about building my confidence

92
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:20,071
      over the years. It's
   because of your friendship

93
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:24,442
that I finally feel able to make
   my dream project a reality.

94
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:29,180
 But I can't build the sanctuary
    alone. Will you join me?

95
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,049
        Of course! Yeah!

96
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,452
      I'm happy to offer my
       extra hooves to ya!

97
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,555
    But come to think of it,
     I actually know a filly

98
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,191
    who'd be more help than I
  would. She's a friend of mine

99
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,294
   from Winona's sheep herdin'
     competition: Wrangler.

100
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,430
       She's an expert in
       animal enclosures.

101
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,031
                 How lovely!

102
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,434
        Ooo! Ooo! Ooo! I
       know somepony, too!

103
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,537
      Hard Hat is the best
 construction pony in Ponyville.

104
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,074
    He can build anything you
  could ever, ever, ever want!

105
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,243
Hearing you all
mention these experts,

106
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,212
I am reminded that I,
too, have the perfect pony

107
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,481
       to help capture the
     essence of your vision.

108
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,985
To give it some
style, some flair!

109
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,985
              Is it you, Rarity?

110
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:13,792
  No, no. Um I was referring to
 the premiere interior designer

111
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,829
        of the Canterlot
     Elite: Dandy Grandeur.

112
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,066
 He helped me when I was setting
    up my Canterlot boutique.

113
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,768
     I know he'd be thrilled
        to work with you!

114
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,505
                 Wow, everypony!
                   Thank you.

115
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,975
     I can't wait to meet all of
     them and hear their ideas.

116
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,710
         We're right on
        track to building

117
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,913
       the most wonderful
     sanctuary in Equestria.

118
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,693
                   Thank you,
                     Rupert!

119
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,767
    Ahem. It's wonderful that
      you all could join me

120
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,803
    to discuss the Ponyville
       sanctuary project.

121
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,972
       My friends have so
     many nice things to say

122
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,074
   about each of your talents!

123
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,844
     This is a big project,
      so I'm happy to have

124
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,747
     such experienced ponies
     working on it with me.

125
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:12,784
     Rarity has impeccable taste
       in design and friends.

126
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,620
         So I can't wait to work
           with you, you know?

127
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,622
         I--I think so.

128
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,090
            Yee-haw!

129
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,259
    I'm just lookin' forward
    to helpin' ya out, ma'am.

130
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,727
        And the animals.

131
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,827
           Of course.

132
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,699
    So, uh... Pinkie Pie said
  you drew up some blueprints?

133
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,002
      Um, Not exactly; it's
    more of a "dream-board."

134
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,847
That sure doesn't look
like an animal hospital.

135
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:46,084
       That's because it's
     not. It's a sanctuary.

136
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:50,655
  A place that is safe but not
 restrictive, cozy but natural.

137
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,358
  A place where the animals can
   come and go as they please.

138
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,333
     So... can you build it?

139
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:17,115
     I want the sanctuary to
    have an open floor plan.

140
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:21,386
No walls, more like an enclosure
   that melts into the trees,

141
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,686
    with a gate in the back.

142
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,223
      That way, the animals
    can return to the forest

143
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,292
   right when they feel ready.

144
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,261
Sneaky! I like it.

145
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,098
      You know, I designed
     the Ponyville Hospital.

146
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,367
      I could do the exact
     same thing right here.

147
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,702
  I still have the blueprints.

148
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:41,339
    Though it'll take a while
    to clear all these trees.

149
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:45,810
  But I don't want to clear the
   trees. I want to use them.

150
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,345
Are you sure?

151
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,945
What you're talking about
doesn't really seem

152
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:53,084
like a cohesive structure. Or
any structure I'm familiar with.

153
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:56,821
       Critters don't live
     the same way ponies do.

154
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,691
 I know this is unconventional,
       but that's because

155
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:03,161
  we're trying to do something
 that's never been done before.

156
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,929
            And I really believe
                 it'll work.

157
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,140
All right, then. I'll
see what I can do.

158
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,443
See, Fluttershy?
Whatever you want!

159
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,778
                  Good.

160
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,948
        I know she thinks
       knows what's best,

161
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,784
      but once she sees how
      much better it works

162
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,886
        with these plans,
        she'll thank us.

163
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,362
    Which one do you like for
     the window treatments?

164
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,732
Loving the print
    on those!

165
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:44,769
      Um... not to be rude, but
     there must be some mistake.

166
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,305
          We have no need for
      curtains at the sanctuary.

167
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,340
        And why ever not?

168
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,444
   Everything is going to look
 natural in the animal habitats,

169
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,913
         not like it was
        made for ponies.

170
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,048
All those shades
of brown and green?

171
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,252
        But... they're so
         drab. You know?

172
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,221
          Ha ha ha ha!

173
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:08,393
 Drab? You're calling the colors
    of beautiful trees drab?

174
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,230
     Exactly! The "natural"
    look is not in right now.

175
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,032
    This is better, trust me.

176
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,370
    I appreciate your input,
   but I just know the animals

177
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,339
     would be happiest with
       dirt brown pillows

178
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,408
     and leaf green accents.

179
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,411
I'll look into it.

180
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,846
                   Thank you.

181
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,048
   When a client has a vision!

182
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:36,755
    Sometimes they need me to
    steer them away from it.

183
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,357
  Especially if its dirt brown.

184
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,996
   And right there we got yer
 standard sheep travelin' cage.

185
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,098
       Fits two critters,
       dependin' on size.

186
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,134
           Hmmm.

187
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,069
What is it, sugarcube?

188
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,139
    I'm looking for something
       less like a cage...

189
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:58,977
   more like a nice hug. Maybe
     if we lose that part...

190
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,980
          Well, then it
       wouldn't be a cage.

191
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,382
                  Exactly! Ooh!

192
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,552
       This is the perfect
     base for a little nest.

193
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,852
   I'll take a bunch of these.

194
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,056
      And anything else the
    animals can burrow into.

195
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,758
              You sure you don't
                want something

196
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,326
                 more secure for
                  the critters?

197
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,028
She does have a
 point there.

198
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,196
You wouldn't want
a bunny wandering

199
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,396
into the wrong
cave, would ya?

200
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:24,169
     No! No cages. I want to
  give the animals the freedom

201
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:28,273
  to come and go. It's the only
  way they'll feel comfortable.

202
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,074
Well, she's the boss!

203
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,391
Hey! What do you
think, Fluttershy?

204
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,992
I told you we'd be fast!

205
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,195
Almost finished with
the building already!

206
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,997
      The color just pops,
            you know?

207
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,968
       Quite roomy inside,
     really. And very safe!

208
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,103
Don't keep us
waiting, Fluttershy!

209
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,540
Do you love it or
do you love it?

210
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:06,144
            I.. I...

211
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:10,615
    I don't love it. This is
    not going to work at all!

212
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,218
       A giraffe can't fit
       through this door.

213
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,053
       With these curtains
       blocking the light,

214
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,889
     how are the birds going
    to sing in the sunshine?

215
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:21,526
         And this is the
     opposite of a nice hug!

216
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,528
                  I know you all
                   worked hard,

217
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,531
            but none of you did
           anything I asked for.

218
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,537
  That's not true! We used the
   trees just like you asked.

219
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,106
And that curtain
fabric is organic!

220
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,308
    It's got
"natural" fibers.

221
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,011
             And I added pillows
              inside my cages!

222
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,380
            That should count as
             feelin' like a hug.

223
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,149
       I may not know much
       about construction,

224
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:48,119
       or interior design,
         or wrangling...

225
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:53,491
    but I am an expert at one
   thing: the care of animals.

226
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:58,930
    And what animals need is
     a sanctuary, not this!

227
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:03,668
 Maybe your vision wasn't all it
 was cracked up to be, you know?

228
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,271
                My vision isn't
               the problem here.

229
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,173
              I told you all
           exactly what I wanted

230
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,542
                 and none of you
                 listened to me!

231
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,645
      So while I appreciate
          your efforts,

232
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:16,414
       I no longer require
         your services.

233
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:26,691
  Hello! The animals have been
  so excited for the sanctuary,

234
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:30,695
 they couldn't wait any longer.
   Can we take a look inside?

235
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:34,699
        Oh, um actually,
    it's uh, not ready and--

236
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,053
          Oh, no! Ahhh!

237
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,002
               Oh, I'm so sorry,
                  Fluttershy.

238
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,238
No, I'm the one who
should be sorry.

239
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,507
This didn't go at all
like I had imagined.

240
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:27,352
    Sleep tight, little one.

241
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:30,188
        It's going to be
         OK, I promise.

242
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,126
    Now, now. Everymouse has
     got to wait their turn.

243
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:42,533
   I'm so sorry. I thought I'd
   have a beautiful sanctuary

244
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,669
       for you all to stay
           in by now,

245
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,605
       but I put my trust
      in the wrong ponies.

246
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:51,476
         It's OK, Fluttershy, I
         know you did your best.

247
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:57,115
    But we can make this work
 here. It'll be a bit... tight,

248
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,015
       but with your help,

249
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,586
 we'll have these patients back
    on their paws in no time.

250
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,389
       Even without a sanctuary.

251
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,591
    No!

252
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,761
        I won't give up!
      These animals need me

253
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:13,031
     and I'm going to solve
     this once and for all.

254
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,299
     If this little lady can
     crawl all the way here

255
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,269
    from Western Equestria, I
   can find a way to build her

256
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,438
      a safe place to rest!

257
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:32,083
         Oops, everyone
       back to sleep now.

258
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,752
       Thanks for coming,
     everypony. As you know,

259
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,789
     building the sanctuary
   didn't go quite as planned.

260
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,624
I know, right? Who'd
have guessed

261
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,326
that Hard Hat wouldn't
build whatever you want?

262
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,295
            I never would have
           invited Dandy to help

263
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,831
             if I thought he'd
           act in such a manner.

264
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,534
     And Wrangler sure made
      a fool outta me, too.

265
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,369
     I'm sorry, Fluttershy.

266
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,639
      It's OK. You were all
      just trying to help.

267
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:58,376
 But I know that letting all the
 experts go was the right call.

268
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,211
      So what are you going
           to do now?

269
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,646
           Try again.

270
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,182
      I'm going to re-build
        the sanctuary...

271
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,217
   and do it my way this time.

272
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,153
                        Awesome!
                That's the spirit!
You show 'em!

273
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,556
           How about putting an
           awesome flying course

274
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,157
      for the birds right there?

275
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,126
And a carrot-cake
stand here!

276
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,627
                 A library cave?

277
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,329
        Everypony, STOP!

278
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,667
        I appreciate you
     sharing your thoughts,

279
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,736
      but I need everypony
        to respect mine.

280
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,473
       Other ponies may be
    experts in their fields,

281
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,642
       but animals are my
       field of expertise.

282
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,378
        And if I say this
        is what I want...

283
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,249
        Then this is what
        needs to happen!

284
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,818
        For the animals,
           of course.

285
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,122
Wow, we should call
you Flutterbold now!

286
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,827
      To get things back on
   track, I called in a favor

287
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,563
       from an old friend.
    He'll be here any minute.

288
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,733
       I thought you said
       no more "experts."

289
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,437
 This is one expert I know I can
 trust to put the animals first.

290
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,606
       Plus there's nopony
       better at building.

291
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,180
Heh heh. I heard somepony
 needs construction help

292
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,882
       for them critters.

293
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,383
        Big Daddy McColt!

294
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,521
 We met each other back when the
  map called me and Fluttershy

295
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,523
    to the Smokey Mountains!

296
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,392
And he certainly knows his stuff
   when it comes to buildings

297
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,594
     and caring for animals.

298
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:28,199
  Well, shucks, let's not stand
    around talkin' about it.

299
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,568
Let's build us
a sanctuary!

300
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,054
         Are you ready?

301
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:28,626
    Oh, I'm more excited than
     a beaver in a log pile!

302
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,230
   OK. You can open your eyes!

303
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,466
     Welcome to Sweetfeather
           Sanctuary!

304
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,970
     A safe and cozy retreat
       for every creature.

305
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:54,252
                 Oh, Fluttershy.
                This is amazing!

306
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,654
Now you should have plenty
of room at the clinic

307
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,690
because once you've treated
them, they can recover here!

308
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,525
With my help, of course.

309
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,865
      It's OK, Lola. We all
      move at our own pace.

310
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:15,439
   Sometimes all we need to do
    is believe in our dreams!

311
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,708
       And when we finally
        reach our goal...

312
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,012
... we'll know that it was worth
   what it took to get there.

313
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:25,650
  Because the view will be even
    better than you imagined.
