1
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,715
       Oh, no I have to...

2
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,759
   I can't believe the winter
      to spring transition

3
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,594
         is almost here.

4
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:32,498
    La. La. La. laaaa. Oh, I
    know. I love it so much,

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,200
        I gave it its own
       term: Springsition!

6
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,668
          Ha ha ha ha !

7
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,805
       Oooh. I like that.

8
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,241
      I'm going to have to
    re-label all my binders.

9
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,642
     Right after we finish--

10
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:49,314
     --Everything! We still
       have so much to do!

11
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,451
       Oh, my bustles and
     bows! Rarity, did we--

12
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:55,287
          Already hemmed, ruched
           and cuffed, my dear.

13
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,756
                             Oh!

14
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:03,595
   Rarity, no reason to panic,
      but um, we seem to be

15
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,198
    temporarily low. And when
    I say "temporarily low",

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,833
   I mean completely out of--

17
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,236
--The baby blue sapphires?
They arrived this morning.

18
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,238
         Oh! Wonderful!

19
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,743
   Oh! What
   about the design for the--

20
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,877
--And done.

21
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,613
       Wow. You are good.

22
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,850
    And you've really outdone
       yourself this time!

23
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:29,154
      The Morning Sunshine
    Tulip frock is gorgeous.

24
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,691
Oh, thank you. Now, I know
you're worried about something

25
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,493
  slipping between the cracks.

26
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:39,164
but with your managerial skills
    and my fabulous designs

27
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,633
   we have everything covered.

28
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:45,804
   You're right, you're right.
      There are no cracks.

29
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,873
  Would you be a dear and fetch
    me some vermillion satin

30
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,773
         from the back?

31
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,873
      And I'll start on the

32
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,444
     Eternal Elegance Empire
    silhouette evening gown.

33
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,746
    My most certain pleasure.

34
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:02,421
    Oh! I love this picture!

35
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:05,424
  When was the last time we had
   that kind of fun together?

36
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:09,661
     I... I can't remember.
     Has it been that long?

37
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,663
      I guess I've been so
      busy running my shop.

38
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:15,300
      Oh, no. Something, or
      should I say somepony

39
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,401
       is slipping between
           the cracks!

40
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,473
    I miss my Sweetie Belle!

41
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,410
      Rarity, we're running
    low on vermillion satin.

42
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,851
I... I can order more!

43
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:19,665
...and this is when we pretended
  we were storybook princesses

44
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,402
      and here we pretended

45
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:26,338
     we were on a dangerous-
      yet-stylish safari...

46
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:32,711
   So many wonderful memories!

47
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,688
Not to put too fine a
point on it but ....

48
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:54,633
Sweetie Belle loves playing
dress up. I miss her so much!

49
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,503
                Then why don't
               you go visit her?

50
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,808
I wish I could, but between
running three stores

51
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,445
and the springsition,
I couldn't possibly!

52
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,614
          But you've already
       done almost all the work.

53
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,882
          I can handle the rest.

54
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,582
      But--

55
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,320
           Rarity, go! I have
        everything well in hoof.

56
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,292
 Point taken.

57
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,861
I am going to visit my sister!

58
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,330
              Way to immediately
               turn that around!

59
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,965
We can spend the
whole day together!

60
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,401
And we can do all of
her favorite things!

61
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,270
                  I'm sure she'd
                    love that!

62
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,305
Oh, Sassy, thank you!

63
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,641
                 Of course! Now
                get out of here!

64
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,743
I'm going! I'm going!

65
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,846
    Hang on, sis. I'm coming!

66
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,754
                 Excuse us!

67
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,355
Coming through!

68
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,457
      Cutie Mark Crusaders
       mid-mission, here!

69
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,074
          That was fun!
       Let's do it again!

70
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,476
        Scoot, we've got
          a job to do.

71
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,376
Later?

72
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:15,947
     All right, Chip Cutter.
      We've done our part.

73
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,949
     The rest is up to you.

74
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,519
     You really think I have
   it in me to be a sculptor?

75
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,687
                     Yup.

76
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,355
    But... why?

77
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,359
          Because you said you
        weren't good at anything

78
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,994
       except getting in trouble
         for making sculptures

79
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,563
       out of your lunch, right?

80
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:35,400
Yeah. I can't help it.
When I look at my sandwich,

81
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:39,104
it's like it's just asking
me to turn it into a dragon.

82
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,774
 Well, what is this slab asking
      you to turn it into?

83
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,348
          Hmmmm. I see.

84
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,096
        Apple Bloom: Wow!
       That's incredible!

85
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,931
            It looks
          just like us!

86
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,966
We knew you had
it in you, Chip.

87
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,036
This is way better than
sandwich sculpting!

88
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,572
       Chip, we're proud of you.

89
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,748
  I finally got my cutie mark!

90
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,583
       Woo-hoo! All right!

91
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,484
              Yes!

92
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,585
                    Way to go!

93
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,794
                  Not a bad way
                 to start a day.

94
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,996
Not a bad way
at all.

95
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,899
Helping ponies is just about
my favorite thing to do.

96
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,070
    Another satisfied client!

97
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,638
             Mm hm!

98
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,842
               So who's up next?

99
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,511
  Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill.

100
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,546
She needs help reconnecting
with her cutie mark:

101
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,914
three puppy paw prints.

102
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,214
        When is she swinging by?

103
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:02,153
   Well, I think she should be
    arriving right about now.

104
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,158
Wow, you are good!

105
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,660
    Come on in, Zipporwhill.

106
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,897
      OK, so what seems to
     be the problem exactly?

107
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:16,735
     It's my puppy, Ripley.
     We used to be so close.

108
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,671
     In fact, I got my cutie
    mark the day I found him

109
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,673
       and took him home.

110
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:25,811
   But now, it's like he wants
     nothing to do with me.

111
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:29,047
Don't you worry; you've
come to the right place.

112
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,451
The Cutie Mark Crusaders
are on the job.

113
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,186
                Trust us, before
                  you know it,

114
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:37,722
        you and your puppy will
       be back to being besties!

115
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,091
   You have the CMC guarantee!

116
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,391
No matter what it takes,

117
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:44,162
we promise you'll have
our full attention.

118
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,131
       Guess who's here to
       spend the whole day

119
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,166
     with her little sister?

120
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,534
             Rarity!

121
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,635
              Whoa!

122
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,946
  So sorry, dear! You're tiny.
  I didn't even see you there!

123
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,148
Tend to get carried
away with my entrances!

124
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,950
<i>♪ Ta da! ♪</i>

125
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,953
Rarity, what are
you doing here?

126
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,656
              I am here to spend
               the day with you!

127
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,925
         I'm so excited, I could
           practically faint.

128
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,094
   You don't happen to have a
 fainting couch in here, do you?

129
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,530
         NO!

130
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,533
         Of course not!
       It's a tree house.

131
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,702
          That would be
          très gauche.

132
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:28,707
 Right, well, I sure am happy to
  see you! And spending the day

133
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,042
    with you does sound like
      a lot of fun, but...

134
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,780
  I'm kinda right in the middle
     of something important.

135
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,716
  I have responsibilities and--

136
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:38,984
    Oh...

137
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,156
      Go on, Sweetie Belle.
     We've got this covered.

138
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,659
     How often do you get to
  spend time with your sister?

139
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,128
              Yeah, go have fun.

140
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,064
      You sure you two can
     handle our client here?

141
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:58,236
"Client?" Oh, that
is so adorable!

142
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,839
      Uh, thanks? I think?

143
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,046
     Oooh! You have mints to
      offer your 'clients'!

144
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,015
       How 'professional'!

145
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,253
Are you sure you
two got this?

146
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,322
       We have it handled.

147
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:23,028
      Oh, my! Look at this
  wall of satisfied customers!

148
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,798
        You girls really
      have come a long way.

149
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,267
Well, all right then.

150
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,637
But let me know if you need
me or run into any trouble!

151
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,740
Come on, come on. You'll never
guess what I have planned!

152
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,217
[squeal] So fun!

153
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,356
 What?

154
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:55,193
    It's just I know how much
  you love these puppet shows!

155
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,393
             I did.

156
00:09:56,395 --> 00:10:00,765
  Oh, it's just like old times!
   You, me, greasy popcorn...

157
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,703
      ... it's like no time
       has passed at all!

158
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,950
Ooh! Ooh! It's
your favorite part!

159
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:39,204
       Banana peels are so
      very, very slippery!

160
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,140
       It's funny because
           it's true!

161
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,646
   What's the matter, darling?

162
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,683
I um, guess I just prefer black
box experimental theater.

163
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,786
        What? Since when?

164
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,322
I don't know. It's no
big deal. This is great.

165
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,998
                OK, we're here!

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,667
                 <i> ♪ Ta-da! ♪</i>

167
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,141
      Aren't you excited to
       be back here again?

168
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:20,278
    Do I know my baby sister,
  or do I know my baby sister?

169
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,083
Uh... yeah. Where
is "here," exactly?

170
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,119
        Oh! Stop being so silly.

171
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,155
          You know this is your
        favorite ice cream shop!

172
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,961
      Oh, right. From when
      I was a little filly.

173
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:40,331
  And I convinced the original
 owner to come out of retirement

174
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,901
       to make you your all-time
           favorite dessert!

175
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,181
Huh. I remember it
being much bigger.

176
00:11:56,183 --> 00:12:00,151
         Well, go ahead. I know
         you're dying to dig in.

177
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,991
                       Well?

178
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:12,430
That was... uh...
one tasty bite.

179
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,833
Still a little hungry though.

180
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,801
   We can get another sundae!

181
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,237
     Chocolate with rainbow
       sprinkles perhaps?

182
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,506
I was thinking something
more like a salad.

183
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:25,944
             A salad? When did
           you get so practical?

184
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:29,948
Oh, um. I guess another
scoop would be fine!

185
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,183
      One more filly clown
        surprise, please!

186
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,059
                  Hey, Ripley!

187
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,794
     Look at me, over here!

188
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,914
  I know you must
be bored, darling.

189
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,517
This is a very long line for
one of Twisty Pop's balloons!

190
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,523
   But just be patient; we'll
      get you your favorite

191
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,125
       balloon bouquet and
     it'll all be worth it!

192
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:27,472
Who's a good puppy? Who's a good
  puppy? You're the good puppy!

193
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,480
    Now come on, puppy-wuppy.
      Get the bally-wally.

194
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,351
                Come on, Ripley!
                   Like this!

195
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,457
           Good, Scootaloo! See?

196
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,096
               It's not working.

197
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,866
        Maybe if the ball
         tasted better?

198
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,401
          I don't think
        that's it, Scoot.

199
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,238
Doesn't look like
it's going so well.

200
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,042
I'm just gonna do a quick
check with the CMC's.

201
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:09,914
Well, I guess duty calls
and you have that now.

202
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,149
                   What?

203
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,852
    Nothing, nothing, go on.

204
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:17,121
    Hey Sweetie Belle, how's
   your day with Rarity going?

205
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:21,192
  Well, it's not exactly great.

206
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,492
   What do you mean?

207
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,464
I don't know, it's like Rarity
doesn't even know me anymore.

208
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,601
         I wish we could say our
          day is going better--

209
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,206
         --but we can't.

210
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,041
 Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy

211
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,977
      doesn't want anything
         to do with her!

212
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,419
Hmmm. I see what you mean.

213
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,589
        Ya know, it's an
       awfully big puppy.

214
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,226
Sweetie Belle! Hurry;
he's making it!

215
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,561
Gotta go.

216
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,537
        I know just what
        to do with this!

217
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,076
     And pose!

218
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,147
         And pose!

219
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,682
   Love the camera!

220
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,285
        Hate the camera.

221
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,486
     Love it again!

222
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:30,295
Sweetie Belle, you did "hate the
  camera" for all these shots!

223
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,297
       Let's do it again.

224
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,164
                   No!

225
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,468
       C'mon Zipporwhill,
        you can do this!

226
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,581
What do you mean no?

227
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:56,187
        Rarity, this is hard for
         me to say, but... um...

228
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,389
Sweetie Belle, what is it?

229
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,658
You've been acting
weird all day.

230
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,328
You used to love doing
these things with me!

231
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,599
   That's just it! I used to!
  That's not who I am anymore.

232
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,570
  This isn't who I am. My cutie
 mark must be for something else

233
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:16,040
      because my puppy just
    doesn't love me anymore!

234
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,681
But it is you. You love
puppet shows and dressing up

235
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,752
and taking silly photos and tiny
little clown-shaped ice creams!

236
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:31,155
   Really?! If you still think
    I like doing this stuff,

237
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,358
      then maybe you don't
         know me at all.

238
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,506
  I can't believe Sweetie Belle
     talked to me like that.

239
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,742
     And after everything I
  did to set up a whole day of

240
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:53,077
   doing her favorite things!

241
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,080
       I mean, accusing me
       of not knowing her!

242
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,082
 I know her better than anypony!

243
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,756
   Thank you, Twisty, but the
     hard truth is my sister

244
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,792
     is being unappreciative
           right now.

245
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,395
  And I'm going to go and give
     her a piece of my mind!

246
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,237
Hey, Zipporwhill. What
are you doing here?

247
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,205
Where are Apple
Bloom and Scootaloo?

248
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,307
     They're with my puppy.

249
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:27,512
      He seems to like them
     better than me anyway.

250
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,415
  Now I'm sure that's not true.

251
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:34,786
  It is. He doesn't like doing
    anything with me anymore.

252
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,091
       He didn't even want
       to play with this.

253
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,460
   And all puppies love these.

254
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:51,069
   I think that might be your
  problem right there. Come on!

255
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,846
    Find Zipporwhill, Ripley.

256
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:04,582
  Woof woof. Zipporwhill woof?

257
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,853
         It's hopeless.

258
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:09,953
Sweetie Belle!

259
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:15,226
   Zipporwhill! We're sorry we
  haven't figured this out yet.

260
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,463
      Don't worry, girls; I
    think I cracked this one.

261
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:25,203
There she is! Oh, dear.
Really should have changed.

262
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,172
  No matter. I'm going to give
    her quite the talking to!

263
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,310
     Right after she's done
     with her conversation.

264
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,279
     Anger is no excuse for
    poor manners, after all.

265
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,117
        OK. Zipporwhill,
        what do you see?

266
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,751
                       My puppy?

267
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:45,656
That's not what I see.
I see a full grown dog.

268
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,693
   He did get bigger, I guess.

269
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,829
           He's not just bigger,
              he's older too.

270
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,234
      You don't still play
       with the same toys

271
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,237
       from when you were
         a foal, do you?

272
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:05,810
   Oh. Ohhh! This squeaker is
   a little small for him now.

273
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,779
       It's just hard for me to
       believe he's not the same

274
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,716
             adorable little guy
              I found anymore.

275
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,752
I understand. But doing
things like you used to

276
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,288
won't turn him
back into a puppy.

277
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,557
        So what do I do?

278
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,559
  Treat him like the dog he is

279
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,828
      and find new favorite
     things to do together.

280
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,329
          You think so?

281
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,497
I know so!

282
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,666
            Rarity!?

283
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,670
 Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what
 you said and you are so right.

284
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,205
         About the dog?

285
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:37,375
Yes, but about us, too!

286
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,878
The truth is, I know you're
not a little filly anymore.

287
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,780
But it's just the
last time we did

288
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,951
all of those things together,
I... I didn't realize

289
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:52,256
it was going to be
the last, last time.

290
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,625
       I loved doing those
        things with you;

291
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,861
       it's hard for me to
          let that go.

292
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:02,900
  Aw, Rarity. I love being with
you too. That will never change!

293
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:06,204
 But maybe we could just try to
  do different things together?

294
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,917
       What is it, puppy?
         I mean, Ripley?

295
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,696
     I love you too, Ripley.

296
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,368
      Thank you, Crusaders!

297
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,337
           No problem!

298
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,443
Sweetie Belle, I
am so very proud

299
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,845
of the pony
you've grown into.

300
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,248
       And I'm proud that
         no matter what,

301
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,284
         I'll always be
       your little sister.

302
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,286
I uhh, have a little bit of time

303
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,521
        before I have to
       head to Canterlot.

304
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,358
   Could we spend it together?

305
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,661
     What would a grown pony
      like you want to do?

306
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:07,365
    Well, I do have one idea.

307
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,475
   I didn't realize your idea
 would be such a delicious one.

308
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,644
      I don't know how I'm
      going to finish this.

309
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,445
       Oh, I'll help you!
