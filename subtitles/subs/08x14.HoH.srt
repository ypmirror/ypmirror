435
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,148
  Well, that's disappointing.

436
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:14,763
          [thudding]

437
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,855
    Discord, you can't keep
    messing up the school.

438
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,227
    On the contrary, I think
    I rather can, and will.

439
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,897
      Then I have just one
      thing to say to you.

440
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,199
 Oh, do go on.

441
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,567
                    I'm sorry.

442
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,235
         What?

443
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,938
             [zap]

444
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,908
 I had to stop thinking like a
  Headmare and start thinking

445
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,710
   like a Guidance Counselor
    to finally understand.

446
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,345
              You felt left out.

447
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:45,850
Uhh...... I-I-I-I don't know what
you're getting at.

448
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,453
             Nopony ever invited
             you to the school.

449
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,289
    And when you offered to
    help, I didn't listen.

450
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,991
  I was so worried about doing
  things Twilight's way,

451
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,961
     I didn't stop to think
   about being a good friend.

452
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,030
I'd like to apologize for that.

453
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,066
     And offer you the
     job of vice-headmare.

454
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,300
             -Huh?
            -Really?

455
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,335
             -What?
             -Why?

456
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,137
Totally confused.

457
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,773
           I ACCEPT!

458
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,011
 I mean, I.. I suppose I can find
 some time in my busy schedule

459
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,046
        to help you out.

460
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,849
But I will need my own office,
expense account, parking space.

461
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,219
   You're new to the world
   of education, aren't you?

462
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,123
 Next time you want something,
  just ask for it, all right?

463
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,160
But then we'd miss out on all
these delightful misadventures.

464
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,596
Hey! Watch the wings!

465
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,433
  Now, vice-headmare Discord,
  if you'll help me get this

466
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,134
Spellvenger Hunt back in order.

467
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,169
             [snap]

468
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,639
    Everything is re-hidden.

469
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,407
              Ah!

470
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:46,344
     [chuckles] Well, with
      a few surprises.

471
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:47,946
[door crashes open]

472
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:49,832
DISCORD!

473
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:53,117
I can't believe you tricked us
into going on a friendship quest

474
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,385
       that wasn't real!

475
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,688
       Oh, back so soon?

476
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,124
       A glamour spell on
        our cutie marks?

477
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,460
  A fake summons from the map?

478
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,262
      Hey, at least we got
       to go spelunking

479
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,963
     in that really creepy
     cave with all those

480
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,633
     eyeless worm
     creatures chasing us.

481
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,170
 Oh, Yona so glad ponies back.

482
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:16,341
   Uh, y'all get the feelin'
   we missed something?

483
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,243
Thanks for taking care
of the school, Starlight.

484
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,945
             It was a challenge.

485
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,013
         But I think
       things turned out

486
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,616
      just the way you'd
       have handled them.

487
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,818
    Guess this means you're
   not vice-headmare anymore.

488
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,655
Ooh poo! I just ordered
business cards!
