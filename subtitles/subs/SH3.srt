1
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,730
Thanks for coming, Rarity.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,320
The rescue center needs
all the help it can get.

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,150
Oh, but of course, darling.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,200
Helping cute little puppies and kitties
will never go out of style.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,240
Once a year, a lucky volunteer
gets to clean the hamster habitat.

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,000
I signed up for it
months ago to be sure I'd get it.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,620
Housecleaning!

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,040
Ooh. Uh, Fluttershy, darling,

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,710
aren't hamsters, uh, rodents?

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,920
They sure are.
But they're cute and cuddly like bunnies.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,350
Okay, everyhamster,
follow Rarity into the next room.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,930
She'll take good care of you
while I give your home a nice scrub.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,860
Rarity, what happened?!

14
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,780
Well, uh, Carl Pettington's coat
just begged to be accessorized,

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,160
but Emilia Furhart refused to be left out

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,160
and got Curtis Pawpower
to chew right through Carl's little scarf,

17
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,420
and before I knew it,

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,000
I had a habitat-wide feud on my hands!

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,340
Also, I named them.

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,340
Ladies and gentlehamsters, please!

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,970
Now, I know you're all upset,

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,470
but why don't we head back
into the habitat and talk it over?

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,310
I never would have guessed hamsters
could be so touchy about fashion!
