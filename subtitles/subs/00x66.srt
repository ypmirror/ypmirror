  before Hearth's Warming Eve.

00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:14,580

     And it's here that our

 Gah. Do we want to know why you're
 wrapping up everypony in town?

66
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,077
      Not wrapping paper.
       A to-do list.

67
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,547
Two of these. Three of those...

68
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,817
      Maybe ten of those.
       Just in case.

69
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,286
Twilight, darling,
are you all right?

70
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,688
      Sure! Just grabbing
        a few things.

71
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,523
   Do I need this? No. That's
    silly. I need EIGHT!

72
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:48,559
               Hey y'all! What's
               everypony...? Oh.

73
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,295
               Traditional
               holiday meltdown?

74
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,897
   Uh huh.

75
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,336
                 Hey, Twilight.
                 How's your day?

76
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,971
I got way behind
grading midterms.

77
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,572
And Cadance and Shining
Armor are coming here

78
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,207
with Flurry Heart for
Hearth's Warming Eve.

79
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,459
And I haven't
started decorating

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,110
and I don't know what
to get any of you, and--

81
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,413
            Stop. Take a breath...

82
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:11,716
            Now let it out <i>slow.</i>

83
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,256
          Now, I think I have an
          idea that might help.

84
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,558
    What if we change up how
    we give gifts this year

85
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,094
       and do a Hearth's
       Warmin' Helper?

86
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,263
       What's a Hearth's
       Warming Helper?

87
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,266
    Whenever the whole Apple
   Family got together,

88
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:28,800
 there were just so many of us,

89
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,103
    it didn't make sense
    to buy everypony gifts.

90
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,704
       So we'd put our
       names in a hat...

91
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,641
           Oooo! A game of
           chance! Tell me more.

92
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,477
Then we'd pull a name,
but keep it a secret!

93
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,980
A dash of mystery.
Good. Good.

94
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,849
       Instead of buyin'
      everypony a present,

95
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,685
 you just get one for the pony
 you picked from the hat!

96
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,588
      Wait. So instead of
       lots of presents,

97
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,024
       I only buy one of
       you a present?

98
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,826
                   WHAT KIND OF GAME
                    IS THIS?

99
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,095
         Well, it would
         save time.

100
00:04:56,197 --> 00:05:00,265
 And you could get the pony you
  pick something really nice...

101
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,001
                           Ahem.

102
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,737
               The less shopping
               the better! In!

103
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,372
   Will that help, Twilight?

104
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,240
I WAS stressed
about shopping..

105
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:16,081
               [groan] Fine. I will only
               buy one present

106
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:19,151
     for my secret Hearth's
     Warming Helper buddy.

107
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,453
      We just need to put
       everypony's name

108
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,488
       in this here hat.

109
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,097
          Y'all ready?
          No peekin'!

110
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,540
                SO. Excited. Ah!
                Too excited!

111
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,975
             I don't want to
             give anything away!

112
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,611
                           Whee!

113
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,813
       When will the gift
        exchange occur?

114
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,949
      How about.. Twilight's
     castle tomorrow night?

115
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,218
     Hearth's Warming Eve!

116
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,686
   That's perfect! Pinkie and
   I can spend the evening

117
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,189
    with y'all and the next
   morning with our families!

118
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,857
And thanks to
all of you,

119
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,759
I should be ready to
celebrate by then!

120
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,395
    Oh, this is so exciting!

121
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:09,935
Uh... Um, Applejack? Is it against
the rules to trade names?

122
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,504
Like if I had a better
idea for somepony special?

123
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,806
I mean, specific?

124
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,508
   If you can figure out who
    has the pony you want,

125
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,811
  and they're OK with tradin',
    I guess it's fine.

126
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,515
        Great! So uh...
        who do you-

127
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,683
            I don't have Rarity.

128
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:25,984
     What? That's
     not who I--

129
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,319
                        Uh-huh.

130
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,765
         Hey, Twilight!

131
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,034
        Whatcha plannin' to
        get your secret pony?

132
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,869
     Not sure. I'm getting
      the castle ready

133
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,306
      for my family first.
       Then I'll shop.

134
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,909
     Maybe something
     sparkly? Fashionable?

135
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,513
  No. Those aren't really the
 kind of things my pony likes.

136
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,082
        Oh. Well, gotta
       go! Wish me luck!

137
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,583
         With shopping..?

138
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,753
  Well, yeah! If every pony's
   only getting one gift,

139
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,221
we have a ton of responsibility

140
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,423
      to make sure it's
      extra special good!

141
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,630
I.. didn't think
of it that way.

142
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,198
       The present I get
        for Pinkie Pie

143
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,833
       should make or
       break her holiday!

144
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,602
  I can't just go shopping and
  hope to find something nice.

145
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,139
    This needs forethought,
    planning, research!

146
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,724
      I'll decorate later.

147
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:24,108
  Knowing Pinkie, she probably
 already has a perfect idea

148
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,644
     what to get her pony!

149
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,615
      I have no idea what
      to get my pony!

150
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,250
     There's a pile of
     presents right there.

151
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,652
   Pick one and you're done.

152
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,788
   Those were for when I was
   getting all of my friends

153
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,091
      matching harmony
     Hearth's Warming hats!

154
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,627
    Now it's just Twilight!

155
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,897
     I can't give one pony
      a matching present

156
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,366
   with nothing to match it!

157
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,201
     I need something
     special for only her!

158
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,905
                  I've got it.

159
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,808
I don't think Twilight likes
rocks as much as you do, Maud.

160
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,877
 Don't rock it till you try it.

161
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,248
      Thanks for the vote
     of confidence, Gummy,

162
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,250
    but this is the biggest
     holiday challenge

163
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,851
        I've ever faced!

164
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,921
    Uh, this one's for you.

165
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,023
    Hey! This is the biggest
    holiday challenge

166
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,626
      I've ever faced! HOW
      EXCITING IS THAT?

167
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,663
Am I up for the challenge? I
know I'm good at gift-giving.

168
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,965
       But am I the best
        at gift giving?

169
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,268
Who would say they're
the best at gift giving?

170
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,403
That's ridiculous.

171
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,639
Uh-
Marble, you're a genius!

172
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,741
Yaks would say they're
the best at gift giving!

173
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,444
If anypony knows what
to do, it's them.

174
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,113
   I gotta go to Yakyakistan!

175
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:38,249
    Thanks, these Pie sister
    talks are the best!

176
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:44,923
                  Pinkie!

177
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:45,957
            I don't have Rarity!

178
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,081
                Woah!

179
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,097
Oh! Heh. How's your
shopping going, Spike?

180
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,431
                 Uh. Fine.

181
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,401
Which pony did you get?

182
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,537
             I...can't remember?

183
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,372
I've got Applejack, darling.

184
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,941
She's going to
adore her present.

185
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,143
    There's a brilliant
    designer in Manehattan,

186
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,947
   Fedora Felt, who makes
    the most marvelous hats!

187
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,484
   I asked for a new take on
   western chic that would be

188
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,487
    the envy of every
     farmpony in Equestria.

189
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,456
  That's a great gift, Rarity.

190
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:22,161
I hope I can find something for
my pony as special as you are...

191
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,463
                She is. Uh, bye!

192
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,803
OK, what about
your favorite food?

193
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,539
         Oh, I couldn't
         pick just one.

194
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,475
      What if it hurt the
     other foods' feelings?

195
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,645
Right.... But there's
gotta be something

196
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,414
you really really like!

197
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:48,119
    I really really like...
  everything! Why do you ask?

198
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:52,424
Just...getting gift ideas.
For my pony. Who isn't you.

199
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:57,062
So... is there anything
you don't like?

200
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,231
          Hm. Not liking things.

201
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,634
Grrr.

202
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,069
      I hope that helped!

203
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,424
        Hey, Fluttershy.

204
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,942
Thinking of getting that for
your Hearth's Warming helper?

205
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,913
                Mm-hm. She loves
                shiny things.

206
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,716
     I wish I knew what my
      secret pony wanted.

207
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,151
   She's so hard to shop for...

208
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,855
  Oh, no. Maybe I could help.
  Unless you don't want to-

209
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:24,657
Rainbow Dash.

210
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,758
 Oh! I was just talking to
 Rainbow Dash about things we-

211
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,762
Great idea! We
SHOULD trade ponies!

212
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,898
                  Wait. Trade?

213
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,567
Well, Applejack said it's
not against the rules.

214
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,171
And you know what Rainbow
Dash likes, so it's perfect!

215
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:46,145
       [gasp] Rarity? What. A.
       Surprise! Thanks!

216
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,947
There you are. I
need your help!

217
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,049
                Do you want to
                trade names too?

218
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,350
        What? No.

219
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,619
   I just need help figurin'
    out what to get Spike.

220
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,787
                     Phew!

221
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,959
   Candle. Great. Whatever.
   Fluttershy shopping done.

222
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,895
 Oh! You can't honestly be serious?

223
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,363
         Ghost candle!

224
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,267
    A candle is what you buy

225
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,471
     when you have no idea
     what to get somepony.

226
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,273
                  Ugh. What do you
                  want, Discord?

227
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,344
 Fluttershy told me about this
 hearth-whatever-it's-called.

228
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,980
     I may not be invited,
   but I wanted to make sure

229
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,415
    she gets a <i>quality</i> gift.

230
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,153
I tried asking her
what she likes,

231
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,221
but she likes everything!

232
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,056
            Well, she says that...

233
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:36,261
       But her REAL friends know
       what she actually likes.

234
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,830
I've known her a lot
longer than you have.

235
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,600
     Then you must surely
     know that lit candles

236
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,871
   around adorably flammable
   animals make her nervous.

237
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,106
                    Don't you?

238
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,944
       Fine. I'll get her
        something else..

239
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,780
Perhaps I'll
tag along.

240
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,916
To steer you in the
right direction.

241
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,484
             Whoa!

242
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,624
      I can't wait to give
      Rarity her gift.

243
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,993
      It'll be just as
     special and beautiful

244
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,662
     and amazing as she is!

245
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,832
     Just imagine when she
     opens it and sees...

246
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,467
         Uh... sees...

247
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,470
        I have no idea
        what to get her!

248
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,478
  I come to the Rainbow Falls

249
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,613
Hearth's Warming craft
fair every year.

250
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,849
They have perfect
presents for anypony!

251
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,051
    Hopefully anydragon too.

252
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,387
           Wanna split up? Meet
           back here in an hour?

253
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,288
       Sure.

254
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,195
        Oh, no! There's
        only a few left!

255
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,833
    Fillies and gentlecolts!

256
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,369
    We want you all to
     have the best holiday

257
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:51,870
       your bits can buy!

258
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,840
      But there are only a
      limited number left!

259
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,975
Limited number of what?

260
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,780
    Why, you don't know about
    Holly the Hearthwarmer?

261
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,316
          You seem like somepony
          looking for a gift

262
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,085
                 for a very
                 special friend!

263
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,104
     I am!

264
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:11,322
 A friend who wouldn't want to
 miss out on the must-have gift

265
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,525
  everypony is talking about?

266
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:16,361
She certainly wouldn't
want to miss out on that!

267
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:20,165
  A truly awesome friend who
 deserves something 20% cooler

268
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,033
 than any other gift out there?

269
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,570
   That sounds just like her!

270
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:28,273
            Well, look no
            further. This. Is. It!

271
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,210
 Oh, oh! How much does it cost?

272
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,178
     How much do you have?

273
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,019
Yojan! Is that good angle
for optimal smashing?

274
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,992
          Guess who!

275
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,059
             Yojan!?

276
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,394
           No, silly!

277
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,731
  Yngvild!? Tormund!? Grunhorn!

278
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,934
      Nopety nope and nien
       and nyet! It's me!

279
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,938
Aw, Prince Rutherford knew
it pink pony all along.

280
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,807
Yaks best at guessing!

281
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,243
    Yaks best at everything!
   That's why I'm here!

282
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,146
  Sorry to interrupt Snilldar
  Fest, but I need help.

283
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:12,083
     Can you tell me where
    to find... BEST GIFT EVER?

284
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,757
Not here. Follow this way.

285
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,096
   Prince Rutherford about to
   tell honorary yak friend

286
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,600
   something very top secret.

287
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,104
 Honorary yak friend listening!

288
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:37,409
       Yaks best at all
       things except one!

289
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,412
 Yaks not best at giving gifts.

290
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,680
            [gasp] What!?

291
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,384
                 I know! It hard
                 to believe.

292
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,386
How am I gonna figure
out how to get Twilight

293
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,221
the best Hearth's
Warming gift ever!?

294
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,524
                   Oh, no worry,
                   honorary yak.

295
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,392
               Prince Rutherford
               keep secret map

296
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,528
                in perfectly
                organized files.

297
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,133
              Best gift givers
               up northern pass,

298
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,269
              where sky shimmers
              and glows.

299
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,771
              There, secret gift
              giver grove.

300
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,241
         Only yak princes and
         pink honorary yak know.

301
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,546
My lips are sealed!

302
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:20,118
   TIME FOR MY TOP-SECRET
   QUEST TO THE GIFT GIVERS!

303
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:34,165
       Oh, hi Rarity! How
       can I help you?

304
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,234
     I expected a package today,

305
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,770
            and I was wondering
            where that might be.

306
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:45,577
Oh, OK. Uh, let's
check. Name?

307
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,679
         Uh, Rarity?

308
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:49,103
             Hm.

309
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,151
Oh! Here we go.

310
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,354
   Your package was delivered
    to Sweet Apple Acres.

311
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,523
     What!? It was supposed
      to be delivered

312
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,325
     to Rarity's Boutique!

313
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:05,764
    Um, OK but now the
   package was for Applejack,

314
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:09,568
        and she is at
       Sweet Apple Acres.

315
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,274
 Yes, it's FOR Applejack,
  but I will be delivering it.

316
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,910
That's my job.

317
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,882
              It's a gift for
              Applejack from.. me.

318
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:25,350
[gasp] What if she opens it!?

319
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,753
It shouldn't go to
Sweet Apple Acres!

320
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:33,592
Oh! Wait. It went to Sweet
Acorn Orchard instead.

321
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:36,928
[giggle] Oh! That's a relief!

322
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,230
           WHY is that a relief?

323
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,969
Because Applejack's not
in Sweet Acorn Orchard.

324
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:47,638
Do you want me to get the
package and deliver it to her?

325
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,744
        No! [ahem] May I
        have the address

326
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,579
        for Sweet Acorn Orchard?

327
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,015
   I think I'll just collect
    the package myself.

328
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,584
Are you sure? Cause
I would be happy to--

329
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,353
                You have helped
                so much already.

330
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,622
Break time!

331
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,692
      Shopping for Rarity.
       No problem.

332
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,796
She likes lots of stuff. I just
 need something extra special.

333
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,098
     Brand new top of the
     line sewing equipment?

334
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,133
A priceless rhinestone necklace?

335
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,101
     A sculpture of Rarity

336
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,136
     made from smaller
     sculptures of Rarity?

337
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:23,875
       [gasp] Oh! Wow! Awesome!

338
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,211
      Shopping for Rarity.
       Slight problem.

339
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,914
  She likes lots of stuff. But
   nothing is special enough!

340
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,623
       Oh, goodness, no.

341
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,061
Even worse.

342
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:47,165
    Oh, come on! Fluttershy
    would love a spa day!

343
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,499
    Really?

344
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,803
Love the stress of deciding
which treatment to get?

345
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,472
Love worrying that she's
not relaxing enough?

346
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,724
Or relaxing too much?

347
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,575
And what about all those sweet
animals she's left alone?

348
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,281
So much to worry about
and all because of you!

349
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:06,051
     She's Fluttershy!
  Everything makes her worry!

350
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,154
Now you sound like
somepony who knows her!

351
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,223
         Well, if you're such an
         expert on Fluttershy,

352
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,125
           what did YOU get her?

353
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,594
Oh, and you honestly
expect me to tell you

354
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,831
what I got Fluttershy so
that you can one up me?

355
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,568
Well, I have half a mind to
stop helping you entirely!

356
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,972
   Good! Please stop helping
   me! I'm begging you!

357
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,041
Well, I suppose I
could tell you

358
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,110
what my back-up
present was.

359
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,179
           Great. Still helping...

360
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,681
It would have made
a lovely addition

361
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,050
to her animal sanctuary.

362
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,020
But you'd have to be the
fastest pony in Equestria

363
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,554
to even have a chance of-

364
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,689
      Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

365
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,059
      You're talking to the
      fastest pony in Equestria!

366
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,261
      If there's some fast
      animal out there

367
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,965
   Fluttershy would love, I'm
    the one who can get it.

368
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,935
Oh, I just don't know...

369
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,536
           I'm calling it! Dibs!

370
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,938
  If you insist.

371
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,778
   The ideal gift for Pinkie
   Pie needs to be a) unique,

372
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,016
 b) specific to her personality
   and c) food-based.

373
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:16,554
 What is a unique food?
 Cupcakes? Nah. Cookies? Nope.

374
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:21,759
      Pies? Pastries?
    Pudding? [gasp] Wait! PUDDING!

375
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:25,263
 After defeating the windigos,

376
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,498
     the Earth Pony, Pegasi
    and Unicorn nations

377
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,335
  prepared the first Hearth's
  Warming meal together.

378
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,404
  Chancellor Puddinghead made
  a pudding so delicious,

379
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,139
 legends were written about it!

380
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,609
      This is it! Unique.
      Totally Pinkie!

381
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,145
      The most incredible
      dessert ever!

382
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,986
      Where's the recipe!?

383
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,358
     I've narrowed down my
     choices for Spike to

384
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,527
     fire-dancin' sticks or
     a Power Ponies comic.

385
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,463
          Un-enchanted. I think.

386
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,999
                   Aaah! What
                    is that!?

387
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:06,605
   Holly the Hearth's Warmer
  doll. Isn't she sweet?

388
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,541
 "I love being an expensive toy!"

389
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:15,246
     Ugh. Why'd you think THAT was a
     good gift for Rainbow Dash?

390
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:19,717
 It's the must-have gift of the
 season! And in short supply!

391
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,825
   Short supply, huh? How
   much did that set ya back?

392
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:28,126
  All my bits.

393
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,996
All my bits! Can I borrow
some for the train ride home?

394
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,967
          Something about this
          here doll seems fishy,

395
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,369
 and I ain't just talking about
 the smell of that plastic.

396
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,971
             Where'd you get it?

397
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,723
         Flim and Flam!

398
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,926
  What are those two Hearth's
  Warmin' hooligans up to now?

399
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,046
Uh, is this Sweet
Acorn Orchard?

400
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:26,717
 It is. But we've never had
 nopony like you visit before.

401
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,619
Uh, Rarity. A pleasure.

402
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,921
I'm actually here
about a package

403
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:31,956
that was recently
deliv-

404
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,225
              Oh, that was
              from you?

405
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,661
Oh! So it did arrive. Ha
ha! If I could just-

406
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,730
       We don't know how
       to thank you!

407
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,098
                  Thank me?

408
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,804
    I was just saying to
   Butternut I wished we knew

409
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,240
      who our Hearth's
      Warming miracle was.

410
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,376
 Oak Nut and I couldn't
 believe it when we opened it!

411
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,678
            Pistachio said right
            away whoever sent it

412
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,414
                 just "got him".

413
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,650
Says when he put it on,
he could feel his destiny!

414
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,853
      As an.. acorn farmer?

415
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:06,390
            Uh! A farmer?
            Filly, please.

416
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,393
        This is a Fedora
         Felt original!

417
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,396
  Look at this bold stitching!

418
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,931
     These daring textures!

419
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,167
       It's a whole new
     take on western chic!

420
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:19,904
    There is <i>no way</i> I would
     wear it in the grove.

421
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,007
     We don't know where he
     got his fashion sense.

422
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,576
Far as we know,
a hat's a hat.

423
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,278
                     Except when
                     it's art.

424
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,779
       Thank you, Rarity.

425
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,649
                     Rarity? THE
                     Rarity!?

426
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,601
     Mm hm.

427
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:35,652
 You have to stay for lunch. I
 won't take no for an answer!

428
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,591
    Uh.. I... would be delighted!

429
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,061
 The recipe for Chancellor
 Puddinghead's magical pudding

430
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,897
    was filed under magical
     spells, not recipes.

431
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,099
      Only took four hours
      to figure that out.

432
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,102
   Let's see. Nutmeg,
    sugarplums, gingerbread, candy canes...

433
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,839
    Warning: to avoid untold
     culinary devastation,

434
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,974
   each ingredient must be
   measured with exact care.

435
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,543
  Ha ha! Book! Have ya met me!?

436
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,447
         Happy Hearth's
          Warming!

437
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:06,484
      But... you're early!

438
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,486
     Your scroll said you
     were coming tomorrow!

439
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,322
                The scroll we
                 sent yesterday..?

440
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,824
Yesterday! Right.
 Welcome!

441
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,561
Eh, what are you doing?

442
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:20,131
  Decorations not up, frazzled
  mane, determined look.

443
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,233
     I've seen this before...

444
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,069
    What are you obsessing
    about this time, Twily?

445
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:25,904
 Nothing!

446
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:29,674
       So decorations
       aren't up because..?

447
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,009
       Er. I thought it would
        be more fun

448
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,744
      if we all decorated
      it together!

449
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:37,247
   Oh! That sounds wonderful. We
  can start decorating right--

450
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,049
       After I finish one
         quick errand.

451
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,652
  Just a few ingredients.
 Nothing to obsess about here!

452
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,288
    Make yourselves at home.
    Be right back! Promise!

453
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,691
       She's definitely freaking
      out about something.

454
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:48,626
Oh yeah.

455
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,518
          By Blitzen's beard! It
          took ya long enough!

456
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,420
            Woah! [slam]

457
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:20,991
   Are you sure you were
   expecting me? My name is--

458
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,695
        Pinkie Pie, I know.
        Cause I know everything.

459
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,430
      Alice: Oh, don't be silly!

460
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,566
      You only know what's
       already happened.

461
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,035
     But you don't know
    what she's about to ask!

462
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:32,937
    Both: What am I about to ask?

463
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,740
      How did you know I
      was gonna say that?

464
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,908
       Will you two stop
        showing off?

465
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,111
      She doesn't have all
      Hearth's Warming!

466
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,480
     Who are you reindeer?

467
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:43,514
 Aurora.

468
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:44,182
             Bori!

469
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:45,116
                        Alice!

470
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,985
 The gift givers of the grove!

471
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,755
 Oooo! And you can help me get
 Twilight the best gift ever?

472
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:52,923
                  Mmhmm!

473
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:57,227
   What about those matching
   hats? They were so cute!

474
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,664
-Well, that was--
--Before she had to get just
  one gift for Twilight.

475
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,266
         Try to keep up, Aurora.

476
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,135
 I'm gonna get that box Pinkie
  is gonna say she likes.

477
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,406
  Aurora remembers gifts
  that have already happened.

478
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,842
   Alice knows the gifts
   that are going to happen.

479
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,878
  I... just stay in the moment

480
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,613
                and keep the two
                of them in line.

481
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:19,917
      Speaking of. I believe we
      have a request for a gift?

482
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:24,455
     The best gift is more
      precious than gold,

483
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,857
     but it cannot be sold.

484
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:31,429
When it breaks, it's not ended,
 for quickly it's mended.

485
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,632
    It can never be bought,
     yet is easily sought.

486
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,934
        Ah! Here we go.

487
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,540
Oooo. I like that box!

488
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,475
                       Told ya!

489
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,914
The perfect gift. WOW!

490
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,649
I don't get it.

491
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,651
                       You will...

492
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,790
             We said.. no refunds!

493
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,292
   Ahem!

494
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,360
                    Oh. <i>You</i>.

495
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:05,296
      What are y'all doin'
      with these dolls

496
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,931
       and that
       ridiculous getup?

497
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,666
        Don't you have a
        resort to run?

498
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:12,803
  It's off-season. Besides,
  we're planning an expansion.

499
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,573
       And expansions cost bits.

500
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,978
       Flim and Flam's
       Fro Yo Flume ride!

501
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,964
        That sounds fu-

502
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:25,449
It ain't no excuse for sellin'
cheap dolls to ponies.

503
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,918
          We're just giving
          ponies what they want!

504
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,288
Shopping for the perfect
gift is stressful.

505
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,523
        Oh, that's true.

506
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,826
   You want to get something
    that really stands out.

507
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:36,803
                 I do!

508
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:40,430
 And when you tell your friend
 you got them the hottest gift

509
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,601
               in Rainbow Falls,
               what'll they say?

510
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:44,969
            Woo hoo?

511
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:50,340
 "The more you spend,
  the more your friend knows you love them!"

512
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:56,680
   Oh. Right. They really are
   good at selling things.

513
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,282
      You may not like it.

514
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:02,352
But technically, we're
not doing anything wrong.

515
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,055
            Ponies are desperate
            for the right gift.

516
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,392
         And who are you to tell
         them this isn't it?

517
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,962
       If ponies get tired of
       Holly after a few days...

518
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,899
...or she falls apart,
who really got hurt?

519
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,868
            Nopony!

520
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,438
          Don't let the curtain
          hit ya on the way out.

521
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,507
Of course Rainbow Dash
wouldn't want this.

522
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,376
I'm so mad I
could just kick...

523
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,147
               Convincin' ponies
               to buy that doll

524
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,082
                 ain't in the
                 holiday spirit.

525
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,951
But Flim and Flam
have a point.

526
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:36,353
We can't tell
ponies what to buy.

527
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,493
                But maybe we
                can show 'em!

528
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,803
                Could you TRY to
                make less noise?

529
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:55,806
           Of course!

530
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:01,645
     Move silently;
    blend into the shadows.

531
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:04,215
    The winterchilla will
     never hear us coming.

532
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,584
        Winter...chilla?

533
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,153
                Small, adorable,
               fuzzy and fast.

534
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,955
  But they're so rare, there's
  no telling where they...

535
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,623
        Oh, there's one
        right there!

536
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,227
                Now, if you're
                going to get it,

537
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,363
               I think the first
               move is to be--

538
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,465
    Be super-fast?

539
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,939
   Making a gift is way more
   personal than buying it.

540
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,641
    Rarity loves things that
     take time and effort.

541
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,646
    I'm sure this one will
     be the one that works.

542
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:40,518
       [yawn] I just... need to
      stay focused and...

543
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:50,529
  Have a wonderful holiday and
  remember, no refunds! Next?

544
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:53,897
  And what are YOU doing here?

545
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,933
Same as everypony else!

546
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:01,105
I want a hearthwarmer!
In fact, I want three!

547
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:02,292
                    Seriously?

548
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:07,478
After I saw my friend here with
hers, I knew I had to buy some!

549
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,915
   For my granny, my brother
  AND my little sister!

550
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,551
 Yeah yeah, great story. Next!

551
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:18,822
 But Applejack! Your granny,
 your brother and your sister.

552
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,325
   They are all so different!

553
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:27,030
  How can the same doll be the
  right gift for all of them?

554
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,467
 Oh. Well, that might be true.

555
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:35,105
But Fluttershy, this is THE
 must-have gift of the season.

556
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,941
      Just because it's
     must-have for one pony

557
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:42,613
  doesn't mean it's must-have
   for <i>everypony</i>. Does it?

558
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,848
   That's true!

559
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,117
I guess I need to
put more thought

560
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,354
into gettin' the right
gift for each pony.

561
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,922
Can I return these?

562
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,390
                  No refunds!

563
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,229
          Oh. Uh...you want 'em?

564
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,132
  I'm gonna go pick out gifts
  that are just as special

565
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,334
   as the ponies they're for.

566
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,705
I... think I'm going to go
do some more shopping too.

567
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,440
     Now hang on a moment!

568
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,342
        Wait! Come back!

569
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,311
                  We'll give you
                  a great deal!

570
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,680
     Buy one get one free!?

571
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,319
      Ah. The sweet sounds
      of the season.

572
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,760
 It's a shame you gotta leave.

573
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,529
    Oh, you've been so generous,
    but I must get home

574
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,531
   for a previous engagement.

575
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,968
    I'll be keeping an
     eye on you, Pistachio.

576
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,438
   I've a feeling you've got
  quite the future in fashion!

577
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:49,312
       Rarity! Rarity! I
       love my parents,

578
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,115
   but.. they don't understand
   that we just had lunch

579
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:55,285
  with one of the most famous
    ponies in Equestria.

580
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,355
Oh.. I don't know about
"most famous".

581
00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,456
Ha ha!

582
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,426
          I know you didn't send
          a Fedora Felt original

583
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,564
  to some nopony you've never
  met from nowhere, Equestria.

584
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,567
       I'm sure this is actually
       for somepony special

585
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:13,803
               so.. if you want it
               back, I get it.

586
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:18,575
The hat is indeed for
somepony very special.

587
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,580
And I couldn't bear to
see <i>him</i> part with it.

588
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:29,019
 [gasp] Oh, thank Celestia, because I
 did not want to give this up! Heh.

589
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,355
But if I hear you call
yourself a nopony again,

590
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:36,060
you shan't be my guest for
fashion week in Manehattan.

591
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,333
       Sorry, Applejack...

592
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,707
       Puttin' those two
        in their places

593
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,343
       makes me all warm
       and fuzzy inside.

594
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,080
  Ooh. But we never got gifts
  for Spike or Rainbow Dash.

595
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,150
           And it's already
           Hearth's Warming Eve.

596
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:01,718
It probably ain't what
they're expectin',

597
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,920
but.. we still got these.

598
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,022
       Yay?

599
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:06,390
                  Don't do that.

600
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,961
Flurry loved sledding!

601
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,530
Too bad her <i>aunt</i>
wasn't there.

602
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,569
             Oooh!

603
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:22,105
       There! Ingredients
       measured exactly!

604
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,307
   Now, what were you saying?

605
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,109
       Hi! Remember us?
      We came all the way

606
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:30,614
  from the Crystal Empire for
  some quality family time?

607
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,983
        OK. I did get a
        little stressed

608
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,584
      about Hearth's
       Warming this year.

609
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,956
       What? You? Never!

610
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,323
     So my friends decided

611
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,092
     we should do a
    Hearth's Warming helper

612
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,695
     and give one pony a
     present to save time!

613
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:48,666
             What?

614
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:52,736
Let me guess. You got super
worried about making sure

615
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:56,139
the present was perfect
and went all Twily-nanas,

616
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,040
didn't you?

617
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,176
           I wasn't Twily-nanas!

618
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,812
               OK fine. A little
               Twily-nanas.

619
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,581
Twilight, we know
you get overwhelmed.

620
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,717
You should have just told
us! We could've helped!

621
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,021
      The good news is, Pinkie's
      present is almost done!

622
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,156
       Then it's just
       friends and family

623
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,859
     and a calm quiet
     Hearth's Warming Eve!

624
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:29,506
 Good-bye. Enjoy your exclusive
 pony-only holiday gathering!

625
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:36,079
   I'll just be home spending
   quality time with.. myself.

626
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:40,895
          Ugh..

627
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,688
  I wouldn't have this little
   fella without you so...

628
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,726
 If you wanna join, Fluttershy
 would love having you.

629
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,729
And.. I wouldn't totally hate it...

630
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,165
     Great! Awesome! In
     that case... Oh, look!

631
00:33:56,267 --> 00:34:00,036
    Sunset! It's officially
     Hearth's Warming Eve!

632
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,674
               What is it doing!?

633
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,350
   Oh uh, did I forget to
 mention that the winterchilla

634
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,954
 transforms into a winterzilla
  when the sun sets?

635
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,892
             How did everypony's
             shopping go?

636
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:26,128
-Well..
   -Um..
            -Yeah....

637
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,132
         Spike: Coming!

638
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,001
             Ha ha...

639
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,704
Did you get attacked
by a party?

640
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,174
     I fell asleep. On
      somepony's present.

641
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:44,814
  RUN! The pudding is coming!

642
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:50,453
Run! The winterzilla
is coming!

643
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,936
       What IS that!?

644
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,306
  Magic pudding! What is THAT!?

645
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:10,841
        A winterchilla!

646
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:13,910
     They turn into
    winterZILLAS after dark!

647
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,746
Does everypony know
this except me!?

648
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:20,495
            Ah!

649
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,453
     You like the sparkly?

650
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,624
    Just follow it this way!

651
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,663
   Is this HONESTLY the best
   plan we can come up with!?

652
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,900
Can't you do something!?

653
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:40,370
              I did! This is
              Fluttershy's gift!

654
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,238
             What!?

655
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,609
     A LITTLE HELP, PLEASE!

656
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,277
         I've got this!

657
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,646
Which one of us
can fly, darling?

658
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:52,561
             Wah!

659
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,985
Your mom sure
is something...

660
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,091
                   You're not so
                   bad yourself...

661
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,003
No, no, no! Not that
sparkly. This one!

662
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:19,109
Uh, I'm OK if he doesn't
want to chase me anymore.

663
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,145
        How we gonna get
       rid of this thing?

664
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,247
    Oh, for Scorpan's sake.

665
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:29,819
   Hello! If only one of you
    had a way with animals?

666
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:30,921
            Oh, my.

667
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,123
Uh. Ahem. Excuse me.

668
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:40,096
   This is supposed to be the
   happiest time of year!

669
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,998
     So if this is how
     you plan on behaving,

670
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,569
  you can march yourself right
  back to where you came from!

671
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:55,345
Oh. Your family is gone for the
holidays and you're all alone?

672
00:36:55,847 --> 00:37:00,717
I'm so sorry. If you calm down,
I'm sure you could join us.

673
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:03,853
                    Ah!

674
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:12,061
   Uh, maybe leave the baking
   to me next time? Heh heh.

675
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:15,699
  Actually, it's pretty good!

676
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,002
Chancellor
Puddinghead's recipe.

677
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,604
       Now that's an
      impressive dessert!

678
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,873
It's your Hearth's
Warming present!

679
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,710
                Really? That's
                so thoughtful!

680
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,245
      It took a lot of
       research, but I--

681
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,683
Maybe focus on the
task at hoof, Twily?

682
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,355
     Right! The recipe
      needed to be exact.

683
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:39,856
      I think Flurry Heart
      added something

684
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,491
    while I wasn't looking,
   but I have no idea

685
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,893
what to add to adjust it.
A teaspoon of nutmeg?

686
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,128
Three sugarplums? Extra-

687
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,364
       gingerbread? Four
       more candy canes?

688
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,098
How do YOU know
the recipe?

689
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:51,568
I don't get it.

690
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,969
                       You will.

691
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,274
    Happy Hearth's Warming,
     Twilight!

692
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,042
   I'm your Hearth's-Warming
    helper!

693
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,995
      A bit reindeer-
       ex-machina, but...

694
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,532
   Two thumbs way up. Whoooo!

695
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,774
Sorry for failing as a
Hearth's Warming helper, Pinkie.

696
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,109
              What!? With no
               pudding disaster,

697
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,178
               my gift with the
               exact ingredients

698
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,381
 wouldn't have made any sense!
  This way it was perfect!

699
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,519
    At least Twilight
     has something to show

700
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:43,753
        for her effort.

701
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,789
    I ordered you a fabulous
    farm hat, Applejack.

702
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:51,061
  Alas, <i>it</i> decided it
   belonged to somepony else.

703
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,831
     Pop said sometimes the
     hat chooses the pony

704
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,032
     when he gave me this.

705
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,535
   Hopefully my gift inspired
   whoever's wearin' it

706
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,537
  to be the best farmer ever.

707
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,539
    Ah. Ooo. Something like that.

708
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,477
       We're really sorry
       about your gifts.

709
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,981
We got a bit distracted with
Flim and Flam's shenanigans.

710
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:16,953
    "Commercialism is the
     greatest gift of all."

711
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:22,825
  They're better than my gift.
  [groan] Sorry about the winterzilla.

712
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,962
Oh, he's a big
sweetheart.

713
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,565
And he ended up
being really helpful!

714
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,238
      It was actually kind
     of nice to be the pony

715
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,006
  who saved the day for once.

716
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,909
        Oh really? You
       mean a giant beast

717
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,644
      that only Fluttershy
       could tame,

718
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,481
     making her the hero of
      Hearth's Warming Eve

719
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,082
       was a great gift?

720
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:51,854
                   Imagine that...

721
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:57,494
  You mean you tricked me into
  putting my friend in danger

722
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:58,695
      on purpose so you...

723
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,767
           Let's just say it
            was from.. both of us.

724
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,338
I guess Hearth's Warmin' helper
 was kind of a disaster.

725
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,176
I don't know. Ponyville
always seems to have way more

726
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,745
exciting holidays than
the Crystal Empire.

727
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:20,083
     There's one gift left.
      But.. I messed up too.

728
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,354
    Your present's only
    kinda finished, Rarity.

729
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,690
       But I guess it's
      better than nothing.

Oh, Spike. A song

748
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,810
I wanted to get you
the best gift ever.

749
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,579
     I just couldn't figure
     out what it was..

750
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:29,218
 Ooo! Ooo! The gift givers told
 me that! Um. What was it..

751
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,488
     The best gift is more
      precious than gold

752
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,673
     but it cannot be sold.

753
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:35,257
 When it breaks, it's not ended
  for quickly it's mended

754
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,094
     it can never be bought
     yet is easily sought.

755
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,063
                What's so funny?

756
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:44,100
It's a riddle. And the

783
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,770
   there's no need to obsess.

784
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,238
