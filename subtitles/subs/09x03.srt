1
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,582
Congratulations,
Silverstream.

2
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:20,086
You're officially the first
non-Pegasus Wonderbolt.

3
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,422
 Really!? That is such an honor!

4
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,992
    I don't know how to thank
      you, Professor Dash!

5
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:30,162
Easy. You're kicking
off our show.. right now!

6
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,231
So get up there
and make me proud.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,235
 Wait..! I don't have my uniform!

8
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,871
    Silverstream! Somehow, I
     missed a class all year

9
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,639
                   and the final
                   is today!

10
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,274
               If I don't pass,
               I can't graduate!

11
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,254
      Whoa. That was weird.

12
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,622
And that's even weirder!

13
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,226
           [slurp] Ah!

14
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,094
              Huh?

15
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,030
      Uh, this isn't mine.

16
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:08,467
       Waaa! Make it stop!
        Make it stop!

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,273
              Huh?

18
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,257
       Good. You have all
      answered my summons.

19
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,226
       Wait. You mean this
         isn't my dream?

20
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,295
              Friends must be
              dreaming together!

21
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:37,829
                     More like a
                     nightmare...

22
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,599
       I know, right? How
       do I pick just one?

23
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,401
     They all look so good!

24
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,737
       That's your version
         of a bad dream?

25
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,673
But why did you bring us
here, Headmare Twilight?

26
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,709
     I am not Twilight. I am
      merely the messenger.

27
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,244
       You all must hurry.

28
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,513
 The Tree of Harmony needs you!

29
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,462
          Lookin' good!

30
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,997
                  Spike! I have
                  horrible news!

31
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,834
What's wrong? Is the Crystal
Empire under attack again?

32
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,770
          What? No! We only have
          twenty highlighters!

33
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:52,771
         And they're all orange!

34
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,074
         How will everycreature
         color code their notes!?

35
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,510
I'm pretty sure you're the
only one that does that.

36
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,480
   Still! Twenty isn't enough
    for the new school year!

37
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,849
We've got plenty of
time to order more.

38
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,384
The friendship students
won't be back until--

39
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,454
                Spike: Uh...now?

40
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,059
                   Well, this is
                   a surprise.

41
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,795
                 Why are you all
                 here so early?

42
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,263
    Did I send out the wrong
      back-to-school date?

43
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,265
       Oh, we're not
        here for school.

44
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,467
Yeah, we're back 'cause
the Tree of Harmony

45
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,535
called us here.

46
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,539
Don't feel bad it
didn't reach out to you.

47
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,474
     We kinda have a special
       connection with it

48
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,476
        after last year.

49
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,412
   But the Tree couldn't have
     called you. It's gone.

50
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,114
      Sombra destroyed it.

51
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,019
Maybe next time, ease in
with those truth bombs.

52
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,254
What about the
Elements of Harmony?

53
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,022
             Those are gone too.

54
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,057
      But doesn't that mean
       the Everfree Forest

55
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,959
    will take over Equestria?

56
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,728
We've got that
part under control.

57
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,330
And Sombra won't
be coming back.

58
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,966
   So...some good news, right?

59
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,970
 Can we see the tree ourselves?

60
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,140
     Or...what's left of it?

61
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,342
     As long as you promise
       to stick together.

62
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,743
        The Castle of the
           Two Sisters

63
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,079
     isn't the safest place,
      as you may remember.

64
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,881
       Yona not scared of
      puckwudgies anymore!

65
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,318
     Friends save whole
    school from evil Pegasus!

66
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,020
She does have a point.

67
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,562
     How could this happen!?

68
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,769
     If only we hadn't gone
     home for summer break,

69
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,871
        maybe we could've
         saved the Tree!

70
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:37,042
Hmph. I wish that Sombra
guy was still around,

71
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,744
so we could teach
him a lesson!

72
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:42,280
That not bring back tree.
 Or Elements of Harmony...

73
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,719
 Wait! We all saw and heard
  the Tree in our dream, right?

74
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,956
     How could it talk to us
     if it was really gone?

75
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,025
   Maybe, if we close our eyes

76
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,261
     and think really strong
      friendship thoughts,

77
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,130
    the Tree will get better!

78
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,565
Eh. I've heard worse
suggestions.

79
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,043
         [whispering]
         Is it working?

80
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:12,845
                          No.

81
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,914
        I guess the Tree
         really IS gone.

82
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,317
Then we need to do
something to honor it!

83
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,485
       Ah! Good idea, Gallus!

84
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,322
      Hey, maybe that's why
       the tree called us!

85
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,657
   It must have used the last
    of its magic to make sure

86
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,659
     we'd come here and
     keep its memory alive!

87
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,828
    It did say it needed us.

88
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,062
<i> Thorax (angry):</i>
<i> Ocellus!</i>

89
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,402
     There you are! The hive
     has been worried sick!

90
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,238
        Why did you leave
       without telling us?

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,006
      The last time you and
     your friends did that,

92
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,475
        it almost brought
      our kingdoms to war!

93
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,779
        Uh sorry, Thorax. It
        was an emergency!

94
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,715
Well, next time, ask
before you run off.

95
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,484
Now c'mon,
let's go home.

96
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,391
Wait! She can't leave!
We have a...Dragon Quest!

97
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,127
         But she's not a dragon.

98
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,495
You know what I mean.

99
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,700
  This quest for <i>all</i> Yona
   friends. Need to help Tree.

100
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,235
And it might take a while.

101
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,004
              Can we stay,
              Headmare Twilight?

102
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,613
   Well, as long you get
 permission from your kingdoms,

103
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,048
    I suppose it's all right.

104
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,850
    You want that permission
    slip in triplicate

105
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,151
        or is one enough?

106
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,120
  What? I like to be prepared.

107
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:41,800
              Yeah!

108
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,102
          Ha ha ha ha !

109
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,754
      Sandbar: Hey, you're back! Great!

110
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,388
      Since I live locally,

111
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,157
       I figured I'd do a
       little cleaning up

112
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,091
      while you were gone.

113
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,926
  Give us a headstart, y'know?

114
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,098
   Sandbar. Where's the tree?

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,067
    I got rid of it. To make
     room for our memorial.

116
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,602
          YOU did this?

117
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,473
    Uh, yeah. That's what you
   guys were thinking, right?

118
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,209
             Sooo not.

119
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:34,012
     How can we remember the
   Tree if it's totally gone!?

120
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,247
    Oh, it's not gone! Look!

121
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,684
      I planted a new Tree!

122
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,929
    Sandbar. You know that's
    not the same tree, right?

123
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,064
  But it's a symbol, you know?

124
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,200
   Pony heart in right place.

125
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:55,967
         Gallus: [growl]

126
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,402
      That doesn't matter!

127
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,305
   This cave was supposed
    to stay EXACTLY the same,

128
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,340
    so future creatures could
    come visit and experience

129
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,875
     the memory of the Tree!

130
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,945
Sorry, everycreature. I
thought I was helping.

131
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,114
       The Tree of Harmony
         is a huge part

132
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,615
     of Equestrian history.

133
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,286
 If we're gonna honor it, we
  need to do better than THAT.

134
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,855
Yeah! Like, with lots of artwork

135
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,958
   that represents the
   symbolism and deep emotions

136
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,226
          of the Tree!

137
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,927
   No, it should be a museum,

138
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,196
     with all the Tree's
     history and artifacts!

139
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,999
       Or a really big and
       imposing monument,

140
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,169
   so everycreature knows how
     powerful the Tree was!

141
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,705
     I think we should turn
     this cave into a place

142
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,274
    for creatures to reflect
    on the Tree's true gift,

143
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,409
    the Elements of Harmony.

144
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,778
             Boring.

145
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,112
     I like my idea better.

146
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,081
       What's more perfect
       than ANOTHER tree?

147
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,883
       What would Headmare
         Twilight want?

148
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,985
Yona! You've been awfully quiet.

149
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,653
  Which idea do you like best?

150
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,156
       Yona like when
       friends not argue.

151
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,458
      Maybe friends
      listen to each other

152
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,259
     and make plan together?

153
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,029
            All: Nah!

154
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,203
   Hey, little guy.
   Need a drink?

157
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,414
                 <i>magical Tree of
                 Harmony museum!</i>

158
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,449
      Come! See the
     birthplace of the Tree!

159
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,720
       Grown from the
       tears of a basilisk

160
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:26,859
    and tended day and
    night by Pony magicians,

161
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:32,064
    this is truly one of the
    wonders of Equestria!

162
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,101
             Uh, Gallus? None of
             that actually true.

163
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,236
        So? Honoring the tree
         means giving it a story

164
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,604
             that creatures will
               care about.

165
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,006
                  It already HAS
                  a great story!

166
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,109
         Yeah, but mine
        makes more sense.

167
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,477
              Whatever, can you
              just keep it down?

168
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,513
       My sapling doesn't
         like the noise.

169
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,284
   Good! It doesn't belong in
   the Tree's memorial anyway!

170
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,054
 AND! If you think this is great,

171
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:01,727
   just wait until you see the
  mystical Cave of Harmony!

172
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,876
       What dragon doing?

173
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,047
       Making a memorial
       statue of the Tree.

174
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,117
When creatures see this,
they'll be super-impressed.

175
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,853
       Uh. Look like rock, not Tree.

176
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,255
I'm not finished yet!

177
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:34,525
And honestly? I'm kinda
having a hard time

178
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,861
      remembering what the
      Tree looked like.

179
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,430
I can't believe I'm
already forgetting.

180
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,746
   Hmm. Needs more "loyalty."

181
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,849
Careful, Yona!
It's not dry yet.

182
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,552
                 What hippogriff
                 painting?

183
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,921
It's the Tree, silly!

184
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,160
   See? These are the emotions
     its loss made me feel,

185
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,029
dancing with the representations

186
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,797
     of elements of harmony!

187
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,468
    Maybe I should label it.

188
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,873
          Oops! Sorry!

189
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:26,010
     Oh, no! Brown isn't
     an Element of Harmony!

190
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,853
Thanks, Yona! This fountain
is heavier than I thought.

191
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,163
      It's for creatures to
      look at as they honor

192
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,699
   the Tree's memory in quiet
   thought and contemplation.

193
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,170
    I got some help and
   guidance from the counselor

194

at our Feelings Forum back home.

       the wrong way.

227

   All remembering Tree of
   Harmony for what Tree WAS,

228
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,307
        not what Tree IS.

229
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,809
         You mean "gone"?

230
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:42,380
   No! Yona mean, even though
    Tree not HERE here,

231
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,850
      Tree here! In hearts.

232
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,853
      Tree made friendship
       even closer.

233
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,857
That's right! We ran
away to be together

234
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,895
right above this spot, the
Castle of the Two Sisters!

235
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,796
 And later on, the
 Tree tested us

236
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,866
   to show us we're
   stronger as a team.

237
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,769
    It DID call us all here.

238
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:08,640
 [gasp] You mean the Tree of Harmony
 lives on in our friendship!

239
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:12,577
  Wow. I can't believe we
   just got schooled by a yak.

240
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,915
  Yaks know things not forever.
  That's why smash and rebuild.

241
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,084
      I think we took care
      of the smashing part.

242
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,688
   Then maybe we should
    start building. Together?

243
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,190
        Just one problem.

244
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,959
  We still haven't decided what
   we should do for the Tree.

245
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,129
         Yona have idea...

246
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,938
       The Tree! Where did
       you find it?

247
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,141
Oh, I didn't
move it too far.

248
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,376
       It was kinda heavy.

249
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,980
            And you're just
            mentioning this now...

250
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,782
    What important is that
    Yona bring back branches

251
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,451
     so friends can rebuild!

252
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,553
     Rebuild what, exactly?

253
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,456
Ooh, I know! Something
that represents what

254
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:02,194
the Tree is: the gateway
to our friendship!

255
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:03,894
              Yes!

256
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,702
        What Ponies
       call it? Club... home?

257
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,237
   A treehouse!

       Sandbar: Well? What
       do you think?

297
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,956
    It's uh ... kinda messy.

298
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,059
   Smolder: Yeah. Like a
    bunch of different parts

299
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,994
     all smooshed together.

300
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,297
             Aw it's just like us!

301
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,400
     Yona think it perfect.

302
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,167
Let's give it a try.

303
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,913
Whoa! What's happening?

304
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,448
            It looks like magic!

305
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,483
       Everycreature, out!

306
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,122
      How.. did that happen?

307
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,626
    [echoing] Because of you.

308
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,994
     The spirit of the Tree
    house would have perished

309
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,930
      without your selfless
        deeds and caring.

310
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,133
             Whenever you seek
              solace, come here.

311
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,302
        Your friendship,
       and the friendship

312
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,371
      of future generations
       will always be safe

313
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,007
       within these walls.

314
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,046
I felt a burst of magic all
the way over at the school!

315
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,582
Is everycreature OK?

316
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,819
              A little confused,
              but definitely OK.

317
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,055
[gasp] Where did
this come from?

318
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,058
We were kinda gonna
ask you the same thing.

319
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,260
           It looks like part of
           the Tree of Harmony.

320
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,830
              But how? I thought
              it was destroyed.

321
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,398
       It was. But when we
      used the broken parts

322
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,601
       to build something
       new, this happened.

323
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,504
    The Tree has always
     been good at surprises.

324
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,708
     When Starswirl planted
        the Tree's seed,

325
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,776
     he didn't even know
    what it would grow into!

326
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,645
        I guess the Tree
         is still alive,

327
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,581
   changing and adapting to be
    whatever Equestria needs.

328
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,183
                 A cool place
                 to hang out?

329
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,819
    Something tells me
     this is more than that.

330
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,488
 It seems the Elements of
  Harmony may still be with us

331
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,690
        in their own way.

332
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,660
              Ah! That's actually
              really reassuring.

333
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:06,130
  But why did the Tree need OUR
  help to become something new?

334
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,799
I'm not sure. If I had to guess,

335
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,903
   I'd say your friendship is
  more powerful than you know.

336
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:17,208
Oh, Yona know. Yona just
need to remind friends.

337
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,810
So, who's going to
give us the tour?

338
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,083
Why don't we all
go in.... together?
