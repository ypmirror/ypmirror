1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,102
  Twilight: Oh. I've been planning
   this retreat for weeks

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,703
       and we're already
       ten minutes behind.

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:05,939
   Where is that photographer!?

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,674
Oh, no, oh no, oh no.
I'm SO SORRY.

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:09,892
Can you forgive me?

6
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:11,409
I don't expect
you to forgive me.

7
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:12,711
           Forgive me?

8
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,514
                      Of course.

9
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:16,300
   I'll help you set up your--

10
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:19,185
       Princess Twilight,
    thanks SO much for this!

11
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:22,121
The Canterlot Historical Society
  is thrilled to document

12
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:24,824
       the friendship work
        your teachers do.

13
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:27,026
Let me just pretty
you all up!

14
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:35,501
               OW!

15
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:36,620
              Hey!

16
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,138
    Don't want a single hair
    out of place, do we?

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,073
 This is for the history books!

18
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,441
             Now...

19
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,149
     Well, that's that! Bye!

20
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,083
              WAIT!

21
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,417
      You forgot Starlight!

22
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,986
    She needs a picture too!

23
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:55,256
              'Kay.

24
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:57,290
 Now I'll get out of your manes!

25
00:00:58,092 --> 00:00:59,559
    I know how busy you are!

26
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:12,872
  Now I have everything I need.

27
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,952
          Yes, I know.

28
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:04,190
   We have been planning
    this for quite some time.

29
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,293
    Oh, thank you, Applejack.

30
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,030
  My spell can create a
   copy of anypony I desire.

31
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:16,135
    All I need is an image
    and a piece of the pony.

32
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,502
          Oh, and this.

33
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,073
       Why copies, Rarity?

34
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,608
     Because Princess
    Twilight and her friends

35
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,610
      control the Elements
         of Harmony.

36
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,380
    The most powerful
    weapon in ALL Equestria.

37
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,450
       Which means YOU...

38
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:34,619
       will, be, able, to,
       use, them, too!

39
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,557
          And serve.. me!

40
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:43,362
    Together, we will destroy
      Twilight Sparkle

41
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,630
   and her meddlesome friends!

42
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,502
   OF COURSE I HAVEN'T
  FORGOTTEN STARLIGHT GLIMMER!

43
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,304
       She stole my hive.

44
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,373
 Turned my subjects against me.

45
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:58,043
   So I'll take her "friends"
  away while she watches.

46
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,579
   And then... I'll destroy her!

47
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,885
        With the Elements
        under my control,

48
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:12,157
 I'll build a NEW hive of earth
  ponies, unicorns and pegasi.

49
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:17,028
       And I will rule as
       Queen ONCE AGAIN!

50
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,617
   Hmm. At least our retreat isn't
    TOO far behind schedule.

51
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,285
       Get ready for fun!

52
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,487
     Are we talking FUN fun?

53
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,856
      Or learning
      pretending to be fun?

54
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,992
      Both! We've all been
        so busy teaching,

55
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,428
  we've hardly had a chance to
  hang out with each other.

56
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,464
  And I may have scheduled some
 friendship activities as well!

57
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,716
          Count me in!

58
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,667
   We can do friendship trust
  falls and pony pyramids...OH!

59
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,803
       And hide and seek!

60
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:58,789
         QUICK! FIND ME!

61
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,674
Well, I love the idea of some
quiet time with my best friends.

62
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,477
               AH! YOU FOUND ME!

63
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,915
    Rarity, why is Applejack
    carrying all your stuff?

64
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,450
      Oh, that's not mine.

65
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:14,253
 Yes, I used to overpack a tad.

66
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,655
      But now it's JUST the
     essentials for me.

67
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,923
       I'm a simple filly.

68
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,392
Normally I wouldn't
lug so much gear,

69
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,229
but did y'all know this is
Starlight's FIRST time campin'?

70
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,332
I just never really
felt the need to...

71
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,501
       hang out in nature.

72
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,272
      Home has books, tea,
      fewer bugs, a roof...

73
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,740
That attitude right
there is why I brought

74
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,360
the whole kit n' caboodle!

75
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:41,779
I'm giving Starlight the FULL
Apple family camping experience!

76
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,786
    Um, where ARE we camping?

77
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,355
 Right next to the elements that
  brought us all together

78
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,723
       in the first place.

79
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,625
      The Tree of Harmony!

80
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,998
      LISTEN to your Queen!

81
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,701
      We must retrieve The
      Elements of Harmony!

82
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,170
Hunting down some
 lame Elements?

83
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,872
This is the worst
 day EVER!

84
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,041
                No. NOW it's the
                 worst day ever.

85
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,844
Those elements are MINE!

86
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,379
Along with this rock.

87
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,047
Oh, and that twig.

88
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,419
I got all kinds of Elements
right here under my hat.

89
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,353
I'll letcha see
'em for five bits.

90
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,290
             Huh. Losers.

91
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,092
               Why didn't you
               just attack them?

92
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,360
    Excuse me?

93
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,197
   You were close enough to
    pull hairs from their manes.

94
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,233
             Why not just take
              your revenge then?

95
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,334
    They've defeated my army.

96
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,269
       I know better than
        to strike alone.

97
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:38,804
   I need--

98
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:39,971
                 Friends?

99
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,940
     SERVANTS.

100
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,209
And the power of
the Elements.

101
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,944
                      Right.....

102
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,747
            So, where are these
            Elements of Harmony?

103
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,816
The location of the most
powerful weapon in Equestria

104
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,820
     isn't something made
     known to just anypony.

105
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:58,223
   I learned they were hidden
   somewhere in this forest.

106
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,892
 Yeah well, it is a big forest.

107
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,098
         Everypony stop!

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,334
     And smell these roses!

109
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:11,470
              Aaah!

110
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,922
            Pinkie: Oh, yeah!
          Twilight: All right! Roses! Fun!

111
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,908
            Now... let's try and
            stay on schedule!

112
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,062
       Applejack, darling?

113
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,680
     Anything in that wagon
      for mane maintenance?

114
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,584
       Uh, let's see here.

115
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,152
    I got a bandana?

116
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,255
         An entire wagon
        and no anti friz?

117
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,923
         Darling, you're
       not even prepared!

118
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,492
       I am. For campin'.

119
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,928
    How you doin', Starlight?

120
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,231
             Great.

121
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,320
             Oh, no!

122
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:47,838
  You and your sister fell out
 of your nest and got separated?

123
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,408
        That's terrible!

124
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,810
              Here.

125
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,112
       I'm sure your home
       isn't TOO far away.

126
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,050
          WAH! PINKIE!

127
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,319
       If we keep stopping
        to have fun,

128
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,887
 we're never going to get to the
  fun things I've got planned!

129
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,524
           Ah! Good point!

130
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,059
     LAST ONE TO THE TREE OF
    HARMONY IS A PARASPRITE!

131
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,365
          I'm so bored!

132
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,568
        Are we there yet?

133
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,786
           WHERE yet?

134
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,403
       We don't even know
       where we're going.

135
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,540
       The quicker we
       search the forest,

136
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,575
       the quicker we
       find the Elements.

137
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,144
 I know where the Elements are.

138
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,214
    This uh, here boulder
     just told me. I swear.

139
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:34,319
You tried to fly out of the
nest, but you fell and got lost?

140
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,323
      Hope ya like walking!

141
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,398
 Come get me when I should care.

142
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:49,337
           Where.  Are.  The others?

143
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:55,273
 Uh, a uh Bugbear in plaid socks
  flew down and uh grabbed 'em.

144
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,775
        Then disappeared!

145
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,378
 Craziest thing I ever did see.

146
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,680
          Turn around.

147
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,814
        We're going back.

148
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,249
             No! Keep searching.

149
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,335
           I'll find the others.

150
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:08,020
    We can accomplish more if
     we split our resources.

151
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,089
           Very well.

152
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,625
     You have my permission.

153
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,795
          "Permission"?

154
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:20,264
 You need us way more than
  we need you, "Your Majesty".

155
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,067
      The others are fools.

156
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,968
  But with me to lead them,
 there's no reason we can't find

157
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,173
    the Elements and keep
    the power for ourselves!

158
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,582
           YOU'RE IT!

159
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,551
        Hey, how did you
        get ahead of me?

160
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:40,839
          You're fast!

161
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:41,763
           Ugh.

162
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,556
   I'm looking for Fluttershy
     and Rainbow Dash!

163
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,325
     Aren't they back there?

164
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,326
                     They are?

165
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,011
  Sure!

166
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,995
Unless they're already
at the Tree of Harmony.

167
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,832
  What is the TREE of Harmony?

168
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,067
           Oh, ha ho!

169
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,269
       This is one of your
       "activities" right?

170
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,371
     Like a friendship quiz?

171
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,872
   It's the crystal tree that
 holds the Elements of Harmony!

172
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,574
              BOOM!

173
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,176
          [gasp] Where is it?

174
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,277
    Bzzzz! It's at the bottom
   of the stairs in the ravine

175
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,246
      by the Castle of the
       Two Sisters!

176
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,481
         A double BOOM!

177
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,582
        How do you know?

178
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,850
         You've SEEN it?

179
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,019
Mm hm!

180
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,787
Honestly Twilight, these
questions are SUPER easy.

181
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,796
     Right where you belong.

182
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,864
          Oh, dear.

183
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,699
   This isn't where I belong.

184
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,303
        Oh, Rainbow Dash!

185
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,404
    I'm so glad you're here.

186
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,973
           I was lost!

187
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,109
                  Bummer. Later.

188
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,411
       What just happened?

189
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,312
         [yelling] Fluttershy!

190
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,116
     Ugh. Fantastic. First Pinkie
       races ahead of us,

191
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,385
   and now Fluttershy is lost
    somewhere behind us.

192
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,855
        My retreat is off
        to a <i>great</i> start.

193
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,891
    It's not like Fluttershy
     to disappear like this.

194
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,459
       We'll split up and
         search for her.

195
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,127
        We can all meet
        back at the Tree.

196
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,929
      Starlight, take the
      navigation gear and--

197
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:58,797
     Go with Rarity? Great!

198
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,864
      Rainbow Dash, YOU can
       go with Applejack! Heh heh.

199
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,400
      I'll find Pinkie Pie.

200
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,141
       Bored bored bored.

201
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,711
    This is ridiculous! Where
     are my other minions?

202
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,715
      Probably plotting
    to steal <i>my</i> things. Grrr.

203
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:21,286
They're at a secret party
up in that there tree,

204
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:26,024
 run by a squirrel named er... Jerome.

205
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,493
       But uh, you need a
       password to get in.

206
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,462
             [growl] ENOUGH!

207
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,301
      You will GO out there
      and find the others.

208
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,036
 You will BRING them back here.

209
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,005
      And we will STEAL the
      Elements of Harmony,

210
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,809
  so I can destroy Starlight's
  life like she destroyed mine!

211
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,811
          <i> Understand?</i>

212
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,112
            Uh huh!

213
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,715
The party password is: Rutabaga.

214
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,387
               Why don't you fly
               up to your <i>nest</i>?

215
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,857
               Oh, that's right.
                YOU CAN'T.

216
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,864
      Oh, Nopony asked <i>you</i>.

217
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,301
         I hope you all
       freeze this winter.

218
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,210
     Hello again, little friend.

219
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,713
             I think I may be
             walking in circles.

220
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,349
                    Oh, my!

221
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,585
         Where did you learn
          that kind of language?

222
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,787
         Um. Excuse me.

223
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,995
Finally! You found her!

224
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,497
               Me? We're looking
                for Fluttershy!

225
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,799
              Where's Starlight?

226
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,468
     Well, if I knew THAT...

227
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,205
              Hey!

228
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,574
          THIS is mine!

229
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,476
        And this as well.

230
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,512
Oh, and this is ABSOLUTELY mine.

231
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,749
 Rarity, what in the hay are ya
  gonna do with a fishing rod?

232
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,451
          I don't know.

233
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:00,953
         But I WANT it.

234
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,460
       Starlight, darling.

235
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,496
 Your'e a gloriously bad camper.

236
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,165
     And coming from me,
      that is saying a lot.

237
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,484
             I know.

238
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:17,702
       Want to break it to
        Applejack for me?

239
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,272
    Who's breakin' what now?

240
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:21,940
                   Who are you?

241
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,975
     Very funny, Applejack.

242
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,545
     Still me under all
      this gear, Starlight.

243
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,413
Starlight..?

244
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,548
How about that.

245
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,315
   Y'all better come with me.

246
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,218
    It's.. dangerous out here!

247
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,287
Applejack darling,
are you all right?

248
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,121
You look a little peaky.

249
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,356
And where's your wagon?

250
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,325
                   Uh, stolen!

251
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,160
              I barely got away!

252
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,363
            Follow me and I'll
           tell ya ALL about it.

253
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,267
             Pinkie!

254
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,301
         There you are!

255
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,636
       What are you doing?

256
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,510
YOU CALL THAT A POP? UGH!

257
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,046
     I thought you were
     racing to the retreat!

258
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,232
    Please.

259
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:07,217
Why would I waste my time on a
boring, lame, no-fun retreat?

260
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,053
              What..?

261
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,391
          Rainbow Dash!

262
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,625
       I think something's
       wrong with Pinkie.

263
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,227
         Not my problem.

264
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,901
 And then all we grew SUPER long
 manes with ALL kinds of colors

265
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,203
 and your castle grew out of the
  ground and everypony was like

266
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,007
  "WHOA!" And then we sang this
    song about Rainbows and--

267
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,775
    Fluttershy! What's wrong?

268
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,447
   Everycreature is mad at me!

269
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,083
[gasp] What? That can't be right.

270
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,254
Can we hurry this up?

271
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,789
We're on a schedule here.

272
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,091
        Twilight, your
       schedule can wait!

273
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,927
       Fluttershy's upset!

274
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,195
 Well, tell her to get over it!

275
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,363
     I'll go get the others.

276
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,265
           STAY. HERE.

277
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,503
             Oh great.

278
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,605
You upset Fluttershy, too?

279
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,324
        You know what, Twilight?

280
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,742
   Maybe if you weren't so
    worried about schedules,

281
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,211
    you'd realize <i>you're</i> the
     one ruining the retreat

282
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,346
        for your friends!

283
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:13,217
[gasp] Well.. if my friends don't care about
 the retreat I planned for them,

284
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,386
      maybe they should've
      stayed HOME!

285
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,655
  CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG?

286
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,191
        Keep it together.

287
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,393
        You can do this.

288
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,594
You NEED those imbeciles if your
 plan is going to come together.

289
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,397
YOUR plan?

290
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,453
                  Uh, THE plan.

291
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:33,638
   I'm just trying to do your
   bidding, Your Majesty.

292
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,008
 Grubsitting you six is nothing
  like controlling my hive.

293
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,044
  Give me one good reason why I
 shouldn't just destroy you all

294
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,246
         and start over.

295
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,616
    Because <i>I</i> know where The
    Elements of Harmony are.

296
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,918
          You NEED me.

297
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,196
           Mine! Mine!

298
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,737
 I'm guessing some kinda curse?

299
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,338
       Maybe Poison Joke?

300
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,273
        Well, somethin'
        sure ain't right.

301
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,476
       What are you
      plotting back there?

302
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,811
    I can HEAR you, you know.

303
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,713
    Don't think you're going
       to steal my things!

304
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,649
              Oof!

305
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,303
            Hang on.

306
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:23,121
  I got a shovel we can use to
whack those vines outta the way.

307
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,342
          I KNEW IT!

308
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:28,793
      I KNEW YOU WANTED IT
       ALL FOR YOURSELVES!

309
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,294
       YOU CAN'T HAVE IT!

310
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,064
     IT'S MINE! YOU HEAR ME!

311
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,600
            ALL MI-I-I-INE!

312
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,874
         So there I was, just me
         and a.... a bucket of honey!

313
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,509
   Yeah, yeah that's the ticket.

314
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,246
   Uh. But I- I survived all by
   myself in this here forest

315
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,950
         for.... 127 hours!

316
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,236
                   Really?

317
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:56,121
  I can't believe you've never
   told us that story before.

318
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,889
      She's making a point.
       WE GET IT.

319
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,926
You're the GREATEST camper
in the history of Equestria.

320
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,462
     Well, I sure don't need
     any of that silly stuff

321
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,365
          YOU'RE luggin' around.

322
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,601
The things you
gave me are SILLY?

323
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,403
     Just look in a mirror!

324
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,704
     Guess I shoulda told
      ya that before, huh?

325
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,173
          Heh heh heh!

326
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,414
      Glad I was so
      <i>entertaining</i> for you.

327
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,087
I'm going to make sure she
doesn't break a hoof out there

328
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,491
and then you and I are going
to have a serious talk!

329
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,959
FINALLY!

330
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,662
There. That's all of you.

331
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,534
      Nopony leaves without
        my say so.

332
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,503
              Now wait a second.

333
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,370
       Weren't you just--

334
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,544
The time for my revenge on
Starlight Glimmer has come!

335
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:56,948
   Let's see if you're telling
   the truth about this tree.

336
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,950
            Ha ha ha!

337
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,087
       Rarity: Starlight!

338
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,323
    Oh, please stop running.

339
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,532
        Twilight: Of course I care
        about Fluttershy!

340
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,136
   Then you got a super-weird
    way of showing it!

341
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,471
    Wh- What in Equestria
    is going on here?

342
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,808
       Twilight is so
       into her "retreat"

343
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,144
   that she doesn't even care
    if her friends are upset!

344
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,645
   She just wants us to STAY.

345
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,847
           ON.
           SCHEDULE!

346
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,317
     Well, I'm SORRY Pinkie!

347
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,753
 If I KNEW you thought this was
 a "boring lame no fun retreat"

348
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,222
I wouldn't have invited
you in the FIRST PLACE!

349
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,658
              I NEVER SAID THAT!

350
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,327
Sorry, y'all.

351
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,895
We woulda been here sooner but
we had to take the long way

352
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,597
after RARITY ran off
with all my stuff!

353
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,867
               Wha! I most certainly
                 did not!

354
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,369
What? You know I
ain't no liar!

355
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:52,971
Where's all your gear?

356
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,440
      Why? So you can LAUGH
        at me some more?

357
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,342
Hey hey! We're
all friends here!

358
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,510
            FRIENDS?

359
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,979
        You left me alone
        in the woods!

360
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,685
        EVERYPONY, QUIET!

361
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,188
             Listen.

362
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,907
 We know each other really well.

363
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,525
The great stuff and how to
get on each other's nerves, too.

364
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,095
       I wanted a fun trip
        with my friends.

365
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,598
   But instead, I got carried
     away with plans

366
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,167
     and ruined everything.

367
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,435
If you want to forget it all and
 head home, I won't be offended.

368
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,872
I just want us to stop fighting.

369
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,408
       Hey, sorry if I
        got carried away

370
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,310
        with all that
         campin' stuff.

371
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:33,595
I'm sorry, too.

372
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,179
I should've just told you
I'll never like camping.

373
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,516
Also: I'll never
like camping.

374
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,718
              Well, if we're all
                being honest...

375
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,421
    I can't survive with just
     this tiny efashionable

376
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,689
       little saddle bag!

377
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,692
        I miss my things!

378
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,428
I'm sorry that you thought that
I thought your plan was lame!

379
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,763
Your plans are
the most unlamest!

380
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,467
And I always have fun
when we're all together.

381
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,504
Even if it's learning
<i>pretending</i> to be fun.

382
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:03,174
   So... does that mean you still
    want to have the retreat?

383
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,275
              YES!

384
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,578
If... everypony likes me again.

385
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,850
      Let's get to that Tree!

386
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,386
    I have the whole campsite
     set up and ready!

387
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,592
      Ugh. What's this garbage?

388
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,395
    Badger installation art.

389
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:25,581
            Ya see...

390
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:28,466
   JUST. RETRIEVE.
  THE ELEMENTS!

391
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:44,081
   Once we get the power of
   the Elements, no creature,

392
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,151
     not even "Her Majesty"
     can tell us what to do.

393
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,487
  Just follow my lead, got it?

394
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,060
    Oooooh! That one's mine!

395
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,032
    Oops. I'd say
    sorry, but I'm not.

396
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,134
Stop it, fools!

397
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,471
     We need the elements
     to take out Chrysalis!

398
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,840
          HOW DARE YOU!

399
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,842
         I CREATED YOU!

400
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,105
           Imbeciles!

401
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,641
     You ruined everything........!

402
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,015
     Servants always
      fail you in the end.

403
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,351
      Just wait, Starlight.

404
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,555
     I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE!

405
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,559
       [gasp] Are you kidding me?

406
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,064
            This was.

407
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,967
      The worst. Day. Ever!

408
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,256
       Come on, everypony.

409
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,407
      We can fix this
      campsite in no time.

410
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,343
   Spoken like a true camper.

411
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,978
       Eh, don't push it.

412
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,749
   You know, if we can
    survive a day like this,

413
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,351
    I think our friendship is
     strong enough to handle

414
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,553
       anything the world
        can throw at us.
