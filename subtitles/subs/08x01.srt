1
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,571
     Twilight: THIS happened
       while we were gone?

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:08,307
Applejack: Wow! Those are
all the places we went

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,042
when we left to
save Equestria!

4
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,545
  Ugh! There's that HORRID town
   where we were almost sold!

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,248
          The pirates! They were
             pretty awesome...

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,851
     er.. once they decided not
     to throw us overboard.

7
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,286
  And Mt. Aris! Ooo, Starlight!

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:28,193
  Did you know we made seashell
necklaces for AAALLL-LLLL the seaponies?

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,495
     I...

10
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:30,629
     you...

11
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,447
   Really?

12
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,464
What about that unicorn?

13
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,167
The one who attacked
   Canterlot?

14
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,836
Tempest. I invited her
to come to Ponyville,

15
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,304
but she wanted to
spread the word

16
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,806
of the Storm
King's defeat...

17
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,741
and share what she
learned about friendship.

18
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,210
       Y'all think that's
        why the map grew?

19
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,646
        Friendship quests
        beyond Equestria?

20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,065
                    I hope not.

21
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,583
      I've had quite enough
    life-threatening adventures,

22
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:52,918
            thank you very much.

23
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,890
How many friendship quests do
you think we need to go on

24
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,793
before we have to
expand the throne room?

25
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,962
    We can't do it all alone.

26
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:04,581
          Sure we can!

27
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:07,199
 We just need to knock this wall
     down, get some paint--

28
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,801
     No. I mean the world is
  filled with so many different

29
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,871
   creatures who know nothing
        about friendship.

30
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,439
 We need help if we're gonna
teach them all about friendship.

31
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,591
          Lots of help.

32
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,442
      Rarity: Perhaps. But
        where does one go

33
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,345
         to learn about
          friendship?

34
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,281
   Here! They can all go here!

35
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,616
       Because we're gonna
         open a school!

36
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,891
       Celestia: I think a
      School of Friendship

37
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,026
         is a wonderful
         idea, Twilight.

38
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,028
                   I'll help in
                  any way I can.

39
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,267
  I just have a few questions:

40
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,802
       What time should
     school start each day?

41
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,536
It really de-
               What's the ideal
               length for class?

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,722
          Do you test regularly?

43
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:21,506
Oh, well that's--
                   What about
                 class projects?

44
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:23,190
   That's a ver--
               Assigned seating?
                 Open seating?

45
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,074
                  Or is that too
                   unstructured?

46
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,547
Oh, Twilight! You
were my star pupil.

47
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,417
If anyone knows how to
run a school, it's you.

48
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,453
    There's a big difference
   between attending a school

49
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,371
        and running one.

50
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,288
     It's not like there's a
       rulebook to follow.

51
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,057
Actually, there is.

52
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,560
The EEA guidebook
is very specific

53
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,894
about how to
run a school.

54
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,697
             The EEA? I've never
               heard of that.

55
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,199
                   Should I have
                  heard of that!?

56
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,335
Of course not, you've never
run a school before!

57
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,804
The Equestria Education
Association is a board

58
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,141
of learned ponies that oversee
every school in Equestria.

59
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,576
               Even YOUR school?

60
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,511
But you're...YOU!

61
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,114
Not even a Princess can
do whatever she likes

62
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,683
when it comes to shaping
young pony minds.

63
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:08,053
The EEA ensures that whether
it's unicorns studying magic,

64
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,555
pegasi learning weather,

65
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,890
or earth ponies
researching agriculture,

66
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:15,194
all schools are held to
the same high standard.

67
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,928
They'll need to
approve your plan

68
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,797
before you can
move forward.

69
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,565
                      OK, Spike.

70
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,701
           Looks like we have a
           presentation to make!

71
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:26,439
Pff. After everything we've been
through, how hard can that be?

72
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,510
    I'm gonna go with
      really hard.

73
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,246
Uh. Hello. My name is--

74
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,048
               Princess Twilight
                 Sparkle.

75
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,117
     I am Chancellor Neighsay.

76
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,353
       Equestria owes you
          a great debt.

77
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,390
 But Princess or no, we expect
    you to do things by...

78
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,458
            The...

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,193
           Book!

80
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,698
I think you'll
find my curriculum

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,899
meets all your
requirements, Chancellor.

82
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,742
 And can we trust you to follow
   through with this plan?

83
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,811
      Or will you leave the
        school unattended

84
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,848
      to gallop off on your
     ... adventures?

85
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,384
My journey beyond Equestria
showed me first hoof

86
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,053
that the threats out there
are greater than we imagined.

87
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,692
If we want to keep
our land safe,

88
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,561
and create a
friendlier tomorrow,

89
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,464
we need to teach the magic
of friendship far and wide.

90
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,735
  A school for ponies to learn
  how to protect themselves...

91
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,705
    Uh, more like respecting
  differences and communicating.

92
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,010
        The EEA concurs.

93
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,481
  Everypony should be prepared
   to defend our way of life.

94
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,484
  So, if your work is in order,

95
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:49,621
      provisional EEA
      approval is granted.

96
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,924
  We will need to observe your
     school up and running

97
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,627
        before it can be
        fully accredited.

98
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,664
Then please, join us for
Friends and Family Day.

99
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,932
It'll be a perfect time
to see our progress!

100
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,050
  Rainbow Dash: It's too much!

101
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,019
            TOO MUCH!

102
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,772
      Rarity: Ah! You think so!?

103
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:25,824
  I had hoped dressing the part
  would help me<i> feel</i> the part.

104
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,526
                 Not your dress!

105
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,729
       This! Us! Teaching?

106
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,231
       They're gonna think
         I'm an egghead!

107
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,937
  Well, the students are gonna
 LOVE my confetti cannon class.

108
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,006
     It's gonna be.. a blast!

109
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,409
        Um. Hello there.
        I'm your teacher.

110
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,044
     I hope you enjoy class.

111
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,647
   But if you don't enjoy it,
      that's OK, too.

112
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,584
I don't know about all this...

113
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,319
     It's going to be fine.

114
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,356
    Everything about this
    school just feels right.

115
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,358
        See? If Twilight
         isn't stressed,

116
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,394
       you've got nothing
         to worry about!

117
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,398
       And you're SURE you
     want US to be teachers?

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,300
    In.. classrooms?

119
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,536
The EEA is VERY clear on how
schools should be run.

120
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,139
We have a HUGE
responsibility,

121
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,742
  and I need you all to do
    this by the book.

122
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,278
That means no cannons
in class, Pinkie.

123
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,048
               Awwwwww! Not even
                a teeny cannon..?

124
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,752
       I know it's not some big adventure
       against the forces of evil.

125
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,055
      But this could be the
      most important thing

126
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,190
        we've ever done!

127
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,658
      I can't run a school
        of Friendship

128
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,126
    without my best friends.

129
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,628
       Can I count on you?

130
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,264
                Of course you
                can, darling.

131
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,934
Call me Professor
Egghead. I'm in.

132
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:49,508
   AHHHH! FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!
       SO MANY NEW PONIES!

133
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,344
About that. ONE thing
I forgot to mention.

134
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,279
     It's not JUST ponies...

135
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,785
            That was unexpected!

136
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,728
   Oooh! Students certainly
   traveled from far and wide

137
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,396
      to attend our school!

138
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,999
Princess Celestia helped me
reach out to all the kingdoms.

139
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,734
After all, friendship
is something

140
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,637
that needs to be shared
with every...creature.

141
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,874
      Welcome to the School
       of Friendship!

142
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,444
       I'm your headmare,
        Twilight Sparkle!

143
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,612
     Please follow Guidance
       Counselor Starlight

144
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,715
     to sign in and get your
       class assignments.

145
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,883
      Then we can show you
      your living quarters!

146
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,987
Whoa, sorry!

147
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,356
I'm Sandbar.

148
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,291
Are you a student
here, too?

149
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,893
          No. I just figured I'd
          randomly stand here

150
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,795
         and see how many ponies
           would walk into me.

151
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,997
    Angry male voice: GALLUS!

152
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,335
                  Grandpa Gruff!

153
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,570
                  What are you
                   doing here?

154
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,438
Flew all the way
from Griffonstone

155
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,140
to introduce Gallus.

156
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,077
            Rainbow Dash, right?

157
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,712
        Gilda told me about you.

158
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:01,848
               You're a teacher?

159
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,783
              Huh. Thought you'd
                be... cooler.

160
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,486
    Gruff male voice: PONIES!

161
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,922
       Prince Rutherford!

162
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,924
                  This Yona Yak.

163
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,359
        She come to pony school.

164
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,195
                 Make it better.

165
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,897
         Yak can't wait
         to meet ponies

166
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,366
       and tell ALL about
          Yakyakistan!

167
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,476
   Why don't I show you around
  before you destroy the place?

168
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,778
       But dragons are
        better than this.

169
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,347
         Why am I here?

170
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:39,318
Because as Dragon Lord,
I'm ordering you to be here!

171
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,054
 Hey! Spike! Come meet Smolder.

172
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,190
Great to see you, Ember.

173
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,194
Uh... Which one is Smolder?

174
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,033
                        Ocellus!

175
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,168
                     What did we
                     talk about?

176
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,504
                     I told you.

177
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,206
                    Stay in your
                      own form.

178
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,908
                 It's the polite
                  thing to do.

179
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,210
               Sorry.. She's shy.

180
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,979
What is THAT?

181
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,853
                      No way!

182
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,489
            I didn't know ponies
             could turn into...

183
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,157
              Um...what are you?

184
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,426
A changeling.

185
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,795
      Ponies can turn into
        changelings!?

186
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,366
No. But changelings
can turn into ponies.

187
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,901
     Huh. That's confusing.

188
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:37,843
  I am General Seaspray of Her
   Majesty Queen Novo's navy.

189
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:42,080
  I would like to introduce the
  queen's niece, Silverstream.

190
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,884
     This place is amazing!

191
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,953
  I've spent most of my life in
    a coral reef under water.

192
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,055
  I was a seapony. But now I'm
    a hippogriff, long story.

193
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,458
         Anyways... WOW!
         IS THAT A YAK!?

194
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,799
    Thank you so much for
  supporting the grand opening

195
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,951
         of our school.

196
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:04,802
  I hope you'll all join us for
   Friends and Family Day

197
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:08,039
   to see the amazing progress
    your students are making!

198
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,977
       Looks like school's
         in session!

247

           Am I bored?

248
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,571
             Ugh. Please.

249
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:55,774
      THESE ponies are the
      heroes of Equestria?

250
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:59,878
  Listen, "these ponies" saved
 all of us from The Storm King.

251
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,081
How? By boring him
into surrender?

252
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,585
    Our teachers are a little
   different than I expected.

253
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,987
        Agh! Pony school
         waste of time!

254
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,356
      YAK school teach how
       to braid Yak hair!

255
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,057
   BRAIDING YAK HAIR IS BEST!

256
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,092
              Whoa!

257
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,294
              Oof!

258
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,231
Is there anything in Yakyakistan
    that isn't the best?

259
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,800
   Yes! Wait. No!

260
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:22,701
    Yaks best.

261
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,103
          No claws, no
           wings, no fire.

262
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,238
       What is it exactly
        you're proud of?

263
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,240
                  Whoa, cool it.

264
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,911
      No need to harsh Yona's
      love for her heritage. OK?

265
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:33,913
                            Aww.

266
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:37,214
    Are we not being sweet and
  friendly enough for you, pony?

267
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,650
That was sarcasm, right?

268
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,352
Because you weren't
being sweet or nice?

269
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,555
 Maybe dragons and griffons are
 just too tough for friendship.

270
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,658
Yaks tough.

271
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,360
Just not nasty.

272
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,395
                 Who you calling
                  nasty, klutz?

273
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,000
        OK, break it up!
         BREAK. IT. UP!

274
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,269
What is going
on here?

275
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,172
   Just a friendly discussion
  about the magic of friendship

276
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,208
        amongst friends.

277
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,077
          Everypony--I
        mean--everyONE--

278
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,578
     go to your next class!

279
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,749
                    I just can't
                     believe it.

280
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:11,767
             Fights breaking out

281
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,784
        when they're supposed to
         be learnin' friendship?

282
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,755
Things definitely aren't
going as "by the book"

283
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,256
as Twilight planned.

284
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,426
      That's because we're
       terrible teachers!

285
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,029
      Face it. This school
        isn't gonna work.

286
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,168
       Applejack: Fights breaking out
        in the hallways!

287
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,738
        I don't look like
           that! Do I?

288
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,208
            I get it.

289
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,842
   Things are getting off to a
  rougher start than expected.

290
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,512
         But that's OK!

291
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,348
  Who are you and what have you
   done with Twilight Sparkle?

292
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:47,218
    Every school in Equestria
      follows these rules.

293
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,554
        As long as we do
       too, we'll be fine.

294
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,256
Maybe we should...

295
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,491
try something new?

296
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,492
         The EEA will be
       here this afternoon

297
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,895
   for Friends and Family Day.

298
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,797
 They need to see a school that
    follows their guidelines.

299
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,100
    Even if those guidelines
       aren't working..?

300
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,737
   Well, then, we have to try
  harder and make sure they do.

301
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,909
    Another morning, another
 chance to inspire our students.

302
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,550
           Hey! Professor Dash's
            class is this way.

303
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,418
Where are you going?

304
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,987
 You're not...
skipping, are you?

305
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,889
         That's exactly
        what we're doing.

306
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,324
But Friends and
 Family Day--

307
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,660
               --is AFTER class.

308
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,264
      Relax! This is just a
  quick... mental health break.

309
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,601
That sounds legit.

310
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,636
We're in.

311
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,704
                  I guess I'll
                tag along too...

312
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,907
       make sure you don't
        get into.. trouble.

313
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,679
Fluttershy: This
way, Angel.

314
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,180
           Professor Fluttershy!

315
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,782
We're busted!

316
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,087
Oh my! What are
you all doing?

317
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,889
Aren't classes
that way?

318
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,995
       A generosity field
        trip, dahhhling.

319
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,830
     I'm taking the students
      to the laaake...

320
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,533
         to look at our
       divine reflections.

321
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,670
      Oh. That sounds nice.

322
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,672
            Have fun!

323
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,513
          I take back everything
           I said about you.

324
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,082
                  That was cool!

325
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:24,983
             Thanks!

326
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,985
       Wait...What did you
          say about me?

327
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,022
   You're sure sticking to the
     book is going to work?

328
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,958
         My friends can
        handle anything.

329
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,526
 They'll have these problems
turned around before we know it.

330
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,794
                       Problems?

331
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,997
      Chancellor Neighsay!

332
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,065
          You're here!

333
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:44,502
          Yes. And you
        seem unprepared.

334
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,137
    If there are problems...

335
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,506
          Problems? Ha!
         Of course not!

336
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,208
        We can't wait to
        show you around.

337
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,478
         [nervous laugh]

338
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,050
     And that's why griffons
  breathe fire when we get mad.

339
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,551
          They do NOT!

340
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,986
         Wait, do they?

341
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,421
           No. Really?

342
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,590
Griffons just full of hot air.

343
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,194
And yaks are actually
good at jokes.

344
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,062
How about that?

345
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,998
                What are dragons
                  good at?

346
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,833
          Competition.

347
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:16,167
      Who's up for a race?

348
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,073
          Rainbow Dash!

349
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,674
        Why aren't you in
        class teaching?

350
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,475
         Because my
       students are gone!

351
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,646
   Uh, gone...somewhere else!

352
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,481
     Doing a loyalty lesson.

353
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,984
And I was just going to
grab, uh ... this pencil!

354
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,118
Because they need it.

355
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,086
Wherever they are.

356
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:35,788
Which I know...

357
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,089
     cause.. I'm the teacher.

358
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,960
    I see. Well, Chancellor,
     we have other classes.

359
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,962
         We can just...---
            Let's follow the... professor.

360
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,933
        I'm quite curious about
       this "lesson in loyalty."

361
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,473
      <i> Twilight: Of course,</i>
       <i> we want to instill</i>

362
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,776
       <i> a sense of loyalty</i>
        <i> towards others.</i>

363
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,079
      <i> We encourage acts of</i>
    <i> generosity and kindness.</i>

364
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,751
   Figured we shouldn't be the
  only ones enjoying the view.

365
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:12,390
  AGH! YAKS NOT BEST AT FLYING!

366
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,059
      <i> An appreciation for</i>
     <i> the value of laughter.</i>

367
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,628
         FLYING IS BEST!

368
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,931
Congratulations, Yona!

369
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:23,334
You are officially the weirdest
thing I've seen so far!

370
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,069
       What do you say, Ocellus?

371
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,005
              Can you be weirder
              than a flying yak?

372
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:31,910
               OH!

373
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:34,645
      ... and to always be
    honest in any situation.

374
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,314
     Honesty is imperative.

375
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,683
        Princess, are we
        going in circles?

376
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,285
     Uh...look at the time!

377
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,754
  We'd better head to the lake
   for Friends and Family Day!

378
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,356
  I'm sure all the students and
    faculty will be there!

379
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,502
             Ha ha!

380
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,505
                What is that!?

381
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,416
   THE SCHOOL IS UNDER ATTACK!

382
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,725
         Oh my goodness!

383
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,328
              Whoa!

384
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,340
    Uh, maybe skipping class
      wasn't the best idea?

385
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,809
          How DARE you!

386
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,844
     This act of aggression
        against ponies--

387
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,412
                   I'm so sorry,
                    Chancellor.

388
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,082
  We clearly had some students
   get a little carried away.

389
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,884
             THOSE are students?

390
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,319
But, you said you were
opening this school

391
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,854
      to protect Equestria!

392
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,258
To defend ponies from
dangerous creatures

393
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,261
who don't have our best
interests at heart.

394
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,863
    My school teaches for all
     of us to work together

395
00:19:58,965 --> 00:19:59,832
       through friendship.

396
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,668
       And how do you know
        these.. creatures

397
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,105
 won't take what they've learned
   here and use it against us?

398
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,207
Friendship isn't
just for ponies.

399
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,675
                   It should be!

400
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,678
       Unicorn think yaks
       no need friendship?

401
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,248
                 Maybe yaks no
               need pony school!

402
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,386
Well, then perhaps you
should return to your kind.

403
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,322
    "Your kind!?"

404
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,290
      Smolder? Let's go!

405
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,796
      Queen Novo will want
        to hear of this.

406
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,700
        This place seemed
          lame anyways.

407
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,306
           It's fine.

408
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,341
      We know not everypony
     sees us the way you do.

409
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,943
        We're used to it.

410
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:51,215
Princess Celestia helped me
reach out to all the kingdoms.

411
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,001
When she hears you closed
the school because--

412
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:56,586
         Because you failed to
       meet the EEA's standards?

413
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:57,755
What!?

414
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,423
         Irresponsible teachers.

415
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,059
        Students skipping class!

416
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,994
             Endangering ponies!

417
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,130
      Your school is a disaster.

418
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:09,133
    Perhaps if you had higher
 standards for who was admitted,

419
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,868
  this could have been avoided.

420
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:12,804
          Regardless...

421
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,849
      By order of the EEA,

422
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,686
          I am shutting
        this school DOWN.

423
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:29,721
               Oh!
