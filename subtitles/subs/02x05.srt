1
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:07,995
Oh... Are those sweet...
carrot pancakes I smell?

2
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:11,205
Mmm... How divine.

3
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:16,219
The aroma... spiced warm apple cider.

4
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:21,725
Ah. And the smell of... smoke.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,608
Smoke? Smoke?!

6
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,535
SMOOOUUARGH!

7
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:31,000
Rarity!

8
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:35,283
You've ruined the surprise.
I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed.

9
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,735
Well, g'mornin', Rarity.

10
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:24,225
Father! Mother!

11
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,939
I'll have you know that
Sweetie Belle here...

12
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,974
...cooked this yummy lookin'
breakfast all on her own.

13
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,247
I... figured.

14
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,720
I didn't know you could burn juice.

15
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,296
I've been giving her lessons.

16
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:41,196
I wouldn't be surprised if she's
got a cutie mark in fancy cooking...

17
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:43,453
...by the time we get back
from our vacation.

18
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:45,332
Vacation? Is that this week?

19
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,777
As in... starting-this-very-instant this week?

20
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,424
Let me guess. Apple sauce?

21
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,493
Nope! Toast.

22
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:58,576
We're gonna have the bestest time
two sisters could even have.

23
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,953
I'm gonna go grab my stuff
from dad's wagon.

24
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:05,614
So... now when you say "a week"...

25
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:08,538
Is that... seven whole days?

26
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,725
And six night, I know.

27
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:13,108
Such a short time to spend
with your lil' sis.

28
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:14,338
You gonna eat that?

29
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:17,298
But I've got such a long to-do list.

30
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,971
Oh, well. I suppose
"spend time with your sister"...

31
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:23,323
...will just have to
be added to the list.

32
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:27,634
Just a few necessities.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,649
Now let's get that
kitchen all cleaned up.

34
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:39,139
Cleaned up? But we
haven't even eaten yet.

35
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,402
Well now, Sweetie Belle.

36
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:45,094
I appreciate the gesture, but we simply
can't eat *this* breakfast. It's burnt.

37
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,619
It's not that burnt.

38
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,820
Never fear, my dear.
I'll get a proper breakfast going.

39
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,271
Can I help?

40
00:02:58,272 --> 00:02:59,486
Oh! Uh...

41
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:01,958
Of course. Uh, in one moment,
Sweetie Belle.

42
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,744
Let me just get things started.

43
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,420
Rarity!

44
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,639
I thought you said I was gonna help.

45
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:20,110
You are! You... can...

46
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:22,946
...put the garnish on the plates.

47
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:25,358
You mean this parsley?

48
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:29,598
Okay now, easy! It has to be just right.

49
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,575
No need to rush.

50
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:32,438
No! That's too slow!

51
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,837
Careful! Back up!

52
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:37,091
Looking for perfection here.

53
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:47,142
Not bad.

54
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,075
There are some things I must attend to.

55
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,105
Can you take the dirty towels
to the laundry room?

56
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,065
No problem! I'll make myself useful.

57
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,568
Sweetie Belle!

58
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:19,881
I told you I'd make
myself useful. Surprised?

59
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:20,882
Am I?

60
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:25,366
You washed my incredibly expensive
one of a kind designer crochet wool sweater!

61
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:28,069
Do you know how hard
these things are to come by?

62
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,133
What's the big deal?

63
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:33,157
The big deal is that
in the heat of the sun wool...

64
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:34,795
...shrinks.

65
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:37,341
Oh. Sorry.

66
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,502
Well, back to work.

67
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:42,862
I must create.

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,441
Sorry?

69
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,955
Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay?

70
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,215
Please?

71
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,875
I just want to do something
nice for my sister.

72
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:59,284
RAAAGH! I'm so bored!

73
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,946
When is Rarity gonna finish her work?

74
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:05,455
"Stay out of trouble, okay?"

75
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,953
I never got in trouble for drawing.

76
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:19,019
Hmm. This needs something...

77
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,073
Hi, Rarity!

78
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:28,608
I made a special drawing for y...

79
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:30,526
AAAAAH!

80
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:33,135
Oh no! Did you use these gems?

81
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:34,929
Well... Yes, but...

82
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,059
I know you have more
in your work room...

83
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,284
Bu... but these are extremely
rare baby blue sapphires!

84
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:43,794
I need them for an outfit for
an extremely important client!

85
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:45,715
Oh. Sorry.

86
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:50,853
Sweetie Belle. What am I
going to do with you?!

87
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:52,277
Oh! We could paint together.

88
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:56,541
We could ride bikes, play chess,
sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight...

89
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:58,349
That not what I meant!

90
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,054
Oh.

91
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,571
Now I have to go and find
some more of these gems.

92
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:02,542
I'll go with you and help...

93
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:03,464
NO!

94
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:07,980
No, thank you.

95
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:11,556
You can help by picking up
these papers and stacking them.

96
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:15,502
Neatly. Put the pens and pencils
exactly where you've found them.

97
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,977
And please find something to do...

98
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,171
...that doesn't create
a large mess for me to clean up!

99
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,459
Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?

100
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,745
Sweetie Belle!

101
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:37,726
I'm back!

102
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:39,649
Sweetie Belle!

103
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:44,725
Surprise!

104
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:47,337
You...

105
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:49,582
My inspiration room!

106
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:53,194
WHAT DID YOU DO?!
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

107
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:57,330
When I saw the big mess in your room,
I thought I'd clean it up for you.

108
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:01,068
This wasn't a mess!
It was organized chaos!

109
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,830
I was just about finished
planning my new fashion line.

110
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:06,244
And... and you... you...
you went and... and then you...

111
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:08,564
...and you put everything away!

112
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:11,519
But every time I make
a mess, you get upset.

113
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,688
But this was MY mess.
In MY house!

114
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:17,825
And now I'll have to
start from scratch!

115
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:21,773
But... I... I thought it would...
make you happy.

116
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:23,351
HAPPY?

117
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,190
HAPPY?! I...

118
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,483
I just need some time alone.

119
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,412
How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?

120
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:49,301
Why, it's smashing!

121
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:50,921
Huh?

122
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:53,580
I just wish we could do
something special together...

123
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:55,758
...that didn't include me
goofing anything up.

124
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:58,249
Oh! The Sisterhooves Social!

125
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,223
Applejack and I do it every year!

126
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:03,886
You and Rarity could compete against other
sister teams in all these neat events.

127
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,893
That sounds like the perfect
way for us to hang out!

128
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,312
Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.

129
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:11,710
What a ridiculous idea!

130
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:14,001
A contest at Sweet Apple Acres?

131
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,621
It doesn't sound...

132
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,876
...very clean.

133
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:21,701
So what? Now you're back
to hating messes?

134
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,242
Sweetie Belle! Watch your tone!

135
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:26,219
I am still your big sister.

136
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,371
Right! And any sister, who
cares about her sister, goes!

137
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:33,452
Sweetie Belle! Honestly.

138
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:37,466
Playing silly little games
in the dirt is just... uncouth.

139
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,461
With or without a sister.

140
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:43,564
Well then... maybe...

141
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,921
...maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves
Social without a sister!

142
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:51,514
In fact, I think I'll try the rest
of my life without a sister!

143
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:56,973
Oh, I'm the one who's
ruining your life!? Really!?

144
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:58,657
Have you looked around this place?

145
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:02,088
I'm the one who would be
better off with no sister!

146
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,187
Well, it looks like we
finally agree on something.

147
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,393
Neither of us needs a sister.

148
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:08,536
DEAL!

149
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:11,197
DEAL! GOODBYE, UNSISTER!

150
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,061
"Uncouth"?

151
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:24,847
She said the Sisterhooves
Social was uncouth?

152
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:27,024
Yeah! Uncouth?

153
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:30,732
Wait. What's uncouth?

154
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:34,746
It's not just the social.
She thinks I'm uncouth.

155
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:37,952
Honey, Rarity thinks
everything's uncouth.

156
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:40,779
What's uncouth?

157
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,454
It means uncivil.
You know, bad mannered.

158
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,582
Exactly!

159
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,228
Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time.

160
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,838
She'll come around. Sisters always do.

161
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,793
Not sisters like Rarity.

162
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:57,342
Come on now. Apple Bloom and I
got some chores to finish up on.

163
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:58,758
Maybe you can help.

164
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,869
You sure you want me to help?
I just mess everything up.

165
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,005
Oh, come on. That's just
stinkin'-thinkin'. Watch.

166
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:14,790
Good catch there, Apple Bloom.

167
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:22,391
This is a chore?

168
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:24,240
Since we can't sell
the bruised apples...

169
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,437
...we gotta collect them all
for the pigs to eat.

170
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:31,421
It's a lotta work.
So we make a game of it.

171
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,530
Wanna try?

172
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,141
Um... Okay.

173
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:36,582
Ow!

174
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:39,958
You're right. It is hard work.

175
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,340
That's why we do it...

176
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,884
...together!

177
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,514
Rarity never wants to do chores together.

178
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,962
All that work ruined.

179
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:53,027
Thanks to Sweetie Belle.

180
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,516
Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here.

181
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:01,938
IDEA!

182
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:04,282
This is genius.

183
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,404
I shall call it:
"Full Spectrum Fashions".

184
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,554
Why, if Sweetie Belle hadn't...

185
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,490
Well. No matter.

186
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:17,179
She still shouldn't have touched
my things without permission.

187
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,142
Apple Bloom! You're up!

188
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:32,711
You're making grape juice?

189
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,924
Rarity would call
the fashion police on me...

190
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,993
...if I got grape juice anywhere
*near* her precious outfits.

191
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:39,789
Well, that's silly.

192
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:42,740
Apple Bloom!

193
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:44,393
Please, Applejack! She didn't mea...

194
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:45,959
Whoa!

195
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:49,263
How d'you like them grapes,
you little whippersnapper?

196
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:50,642
That tickles...!

197
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:57,710
Now to get these fabrics washed
for my fabulous new line.

198
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,328
Oh! My favorite sweater.

199
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,930
I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle...

200
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,046
Oh, Opal, Opal.

201
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:15,023
It's as if Sweetie Belle knew
the sweater was perfect for you.

202
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:18,485
And Sweetie Belle should consider
herself perfectly lucky...

203
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:21,197
...that this thoughtless
mishap turned out all right.

204
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,721
Apple Bloom!

205
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:28,345
Got it, sis!

206
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,916
Wow. It's as if they're just one pony.

207
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,546
YEEHAW!

208
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,560
Way to corral some critters, sis.

209
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:40,447
You could have just asked.

210
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,011
Rarity never high-hooves me.

211
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:47,469
Perfect.

212
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,543
Just one more and this ensemble is fini.

213
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,095
Sweetie Belle!

214
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:57,047
Where's her silly little
arts and crafts project?

215
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:09,720
Oh, Sweetie Belle!
My one and only sister.

216
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,385
What have I done?!

217
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:15,502
All the time I could have
spent with you was wasted...

218
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,113
...complaining and wishing
you were gone!

219
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:21,236
WOE IS ME!!!

220
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:23,056
No! I must get her back.

221
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:24,692
I must!

222
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:30,008
As Celestia is my witness,
I shall never be sisterless again!

223
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:37,411
Sweetie Belle!

224
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:41,739
I have been galloping all over,
looking for you. I...

225
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,880
Oh, hello, unsister.
What are you doing here?

226
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:49,870
Better be careful. You might
get some dust on you.

227
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,454
Oh, Sweetie Belle. I want to apologize.

228
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:57,481
I am not better off without a sister.

229
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,206
I'm not better off
without a sister either.

230
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,525
Spending the day with Applejack and
Apple Bloom made me realize that.

231
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:05,750
Oh! Oh, Sweetie.

232
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:07,891
You don't know how happy
I am to hear you...

233
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:11,976
And that's why I'm adopting
Applejack as my big sister!

234
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:12,933
WHAT?!

235
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:14,821
-What?
-What?

236
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,332
A sister is someone who loves
and takes care of another sister.

237
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,701
Applejack's a real sister.

238
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:25,884
Hold on, Sweetie Belle.
Don't get ahead of yourself here.

239
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:28,894
Besides, she's MY big sister.

240
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:30,952
Yeah. Um...

241
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,782
Or maybe she should be *your* sister...

242
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:37,482
...so she could teach you what
a good sister is supposed to be.

243
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:41,182
Um, actually I...

244
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,131
Oh, I don't need lessons on being
a good sister. I... I promise!

245
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,755
Listen. I'll show you how to
cook my favorite quiche.

246
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:51,787
Or... or I'll show you the proper
way to beautify your mane.

247
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:53,741
Won't that be fun?

248
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,180
You want me to go home with you...

249
00:14:57,181 --> 00:15:01,261
...so *we* can do what *you* wanna do?

250
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:03,578
Uh... Yes?

251
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,805
Just forget it!

252
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,785
We're still sisters, right?

253
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:13,883
Well, that apology went swimmingly.

254
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:18,806
Applejack, why do you have to be
so good and make me look so bad?

255
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:20,844
Oh, Rarity.

256
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:23,377
Once again you're
thinkin' about yourself.

257
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:25,918
Bein' sisters is a give and take.

258
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:27,971
You've been doin'
a whole lotta takin'...

259
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:30,092
...but you haven't been
doin' a whole lotta givin'.

260
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:32,727
But of course I give!

261
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,923
I give lessons. Reasonable demands.

262
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:38,413
But you never give in.

263
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,404
Bein' sisters is like...

264
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:42,639
...apple pie!

265
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:47,612
You can have amazin' apples and you can
have a wonderfully crispy crust...

266
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,726
...but only together can you
have a perfect apple pie.

267
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:58,531
But apart all we are is just a pile
of mush and some crumbly dry mess.

268
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:01,679
I know what I need to do!

269
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,030
I just hope it isn't too late.

270
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:17,052
Well, I guess it's a good
thing Rarity isn't here.

271
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:20,669
Do I see "uncouth" written
all over this contest?

272
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,745
Look at the size of that pig!

273
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,706
He sure is a cutie.

274
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:28,390
That's the last word Rarity would use.

275
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:31,796
"Oh my! What a repulsive monstrosity!"

276
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:34,479
"This thing needs
a head to toe makeover!"

277
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,845
It's almost time!

278
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,272
Well, you two have fun.

279
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,551
I sure wish I had a sister
to run a race with.

280
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:44,239
Huh?

281
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,423
You do now!

282
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:48,284
AB and I figured since
we do this every year...

283
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,830
...I'd like you borrow my sis,
so you can give it a try.

284
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:52,297
Sister for a day.

285
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:53,801
No way!

286
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:55,597
One. Day.

287
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,449
One. Day.

288
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:02,048
Is this thing on?

289
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:04,482
I don't think this thing is on.

290
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:05,933
Hello!

291
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:07,970
What a...? Uh...

292
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:09,436
You have to say so.

293
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,918
Confangled modern doohickey!

294
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:15,505
Now's the event you all
been waitin' for!

295
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:18,648
The Sistersoci... The Socialhoof...

296
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:22,205
Oh, dagnabit! You know, the big race!

297
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:25,162
We have five teams
this year for the event!

298
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:28,372
So all ya head on up
to the finish line, y'hear?

299
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:33,132
THE START LINE! You coulda said.

300
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,274
That's us.

301
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:37,593
One. Day. Good luck!

302
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,360
And may the best sisters win!

303
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,152
On your mark...

304
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,481
Get set...

305
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:48,953
GOOO!

306
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:58,463
You okay, Applejack?

307
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,002
Applejack! Help!

308
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,491
You can do it, sister!

309
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:26,285
Oh, it was so close!

310
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:27,952
You almost won!

311
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:30,414
Thank you, Applejack. You were amazing.

312
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:32,171
I don't even care that we didn't win.

313
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,109
It was so much fun!

314
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,969
Huh?

315
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:40,681
Rarity?

316
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,134
Wait. Where's Applejack?

317
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:49,004
I don't get it.

318
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:53,985
We switched places over
at the very first mudhole.

319
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:58,323
So we did the whole
competition together?

320
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:00,328
That we did, little sister.

321
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,629
Well, except for the start line.

322
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,801
But you finished together.

323
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:07,906
You mean you were all in on it?

324
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,993
You did this for me?

325
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:14,034
Us. I did it for us.

326
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:19,360
You see? We *are* apple pie.

327
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:22,629
Uh... I'll explain later.

328
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,729
For now, I think we
deserve a celebration.

329
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,429
YEAH!

330
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,506
Where?

331
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:29,973
The spa, of course.

332
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:32,806
Oh, Rarity.

333
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,489
No, I... I'm serious.

334
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:42,030
Very well then. What should we
write to the princess?

335
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:42,917
I'll start.

336
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:46,549
"Having a sister is just about
the bestest thing in the world."

337
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,584
"But it sure isn't the easiest."

338
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:51,621
"I agree, that being sisters
is a wonderful thing..."

339
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:53,526
"...but it takes teamwork."

340
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:56,300
"Sometimes it's about compromising."

341
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,677
"Sometimes it's about accepting
each other's differences."

342
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:06,368
"But mostly it's about
having fun together."

343
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,359
"Even if it means getting your
hooves a little bit dirty."

344
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,913
A lot dirty!

345
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:14,527
A little bit dirty.

346
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:15,769
A lot dirty!

347
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,751
A little bit dirty!

348
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:20,466
-A lo...
-Hold it, hold it.

349
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,650
How about... "a medium
amount of dirty..."

350
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:25,518
"...not too little, not
too much, just right."

351
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,096
Deal!

352
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:36,464
