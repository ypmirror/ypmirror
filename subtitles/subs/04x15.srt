<i>Sweetie Belle,</i>

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:05,594
maybe we should run
through the steps

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:07,617
another few times before
you try it on your own.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,035
Nope. Ready to give
it a shot!

5
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:12,360
OK then.

6
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:22,218
Can't seem to...

7
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:31,276
Agh! I think I threw
my neck out.

8
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:33,135
Aw, you're OK.

9
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:36,407
A little more magic practice and
lifting brooms'll be a cinch.

10
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:37,365
I doubt it.

11
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:38,546
That thing weighs a ton.

12
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,725
Hey, has anypony
here seen my--?

13
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:42,193
Oh. There it is.

14
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:49,244
Hmph. I'll never get my
cutie mark for this.

15
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,450
Maybe not.

16
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:52,474
But I'm happy to keep
helping you learn

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,388
just for the fun of
it as long you like.

18
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,108
Hey, who's gonna
clean up this mess?

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,833
This is no mess!

20
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:03,879
These are the carefully
arranged pieces of a unicycle

21
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:06,165
I took apart and will be
putting back together

22
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,210
as soon as Twilight
shows me how.

23
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:12,667
Scootaloo, I already told
you I won't show you how.

24
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,390
But I'll help you
find the instructions

25
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:15,867
so you can figure
it out yourself.

26
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,154
Blech, I hate research.

27
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,567
To your left, third
shelf from the bottom.

28
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:22,111
You'll find it in no time.

29
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,124
Thanks so much for
helping us all learn

30
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:25,449
these new skills, Twilight.

31
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,967
Always glad to pass on my love
of learning for learning's sake.

32
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:33,043
Only I'm afraid I'll never get
the hang of this potion-making.

33
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:35,467
Did you follow the magic
plant-growing formula

34
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:36,083
I gave you?

35
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:39,418
Well, uh more or less.

36
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,330
Well, let's try it out
on this apple seedling

37
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:44,579
<i>and see how we do.</i>

38
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,962
Ooh, I hope this works!

39
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,839
Laying it on a little
thick there, aren't we, pal?

40
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:24,420

00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,789
<i>Yoohoo! Gather round!</i>

42
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:01,582
It's time!

43
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:09,069
As you all know, I had
promised to put on an amazing

44
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,698
first-time-ever acrobatic
display for you all today.

45
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:17,945
I know. It's so exciting.

46
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:19,857
But I'm tired.

47
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,812
But I did not wish
to disappoint you all,

48
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,209
so I brought my butler
Randolph to do them for me.

49
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:42,803
That was amazing,
Diamond Tiara.

50
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,949
I know. I don't
know how I do it.

51
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,848
I can't believe she
gets so much attention

52
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,067
without even really
doing anything.

53
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,089
She's using somepony
else to build herself up.

54
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,640
And without even putting in the
effort to learn her own skills

55
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,418
like we do.

56
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,555
Hey, come to think of it,

57
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,340
if we get really
good at the stuff

58
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,815
Twilight's teaching us, we could
be the big shots around here

59
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,778
for a change. Hmm...

60
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:10,608
Check this out.

61
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,064
And check this out.

62
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:19,441
<i>And check this out.</i>

63
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,945
Whoa!

64
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:24,267
Hey! Put me down!

65
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,403
Hey, can't you
hear me?

66
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:31,896
Huh? Wha?

67
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,801
I was asking if your sister
Rarity will be taking you

68
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,938
to Manehattan anytime soon.

69
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,962
Because if she is, maybe
you can meet up with us

70
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:42,938
while we hang out with a
bunch of famous celebrities.

71
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:43,925
Cool!

72
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,664
Wow, that's pretty
nice of you guys.

73
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,355
Actually, my sister
hasn't offered to take me

74
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,945
to Manehattan anytime soon.

75
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:54,579
Yeah, we figured.

76
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,196
Bump. Bump. Sugarlump. Rump.

77
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:02,415
Oh yeah? Well, I don't have to
go all the way to Manehattan

78
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,600
to hang out with the famous
and super-cool ponies.

79
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,428
Me and my friends hang out with
Princess Twilight all the time!

80
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,449
Did you say
"Princess Twilight?"

81
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,225
You hang out with
her all the time?

82
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,304
For real?

83
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:20,357
More like just once a week.

84
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,983
She helps us learn
cool new stuff to do.

85
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:26,078
That we actually do.
Ourselves!

86
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:31,601
You must bring me
along next time you go!

87
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:32,995
Bring us along!

88
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:35,379
<i>I mean we used to see</i>
<i>her around town all the time.</i>

89
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:36,647
<i>And I thought whatever.</i>

90
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,154
Me too. I thought that.

91
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:42,446
But now she's a Princess, which
makes her totally awesome.

92
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:44,398
Plus she has wings.

93
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:46,126
And she's an Alicorn.

94
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,211
So can I?

95
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:47,793
We?

96
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:48,470
Go?

97
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:50,985
I don't think
we should.

98
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:52,723
Won't you two excuse
us for a moment?

99
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,319
We should totally say yes.

100
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,887
This is a golden opportunity!

101
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,011
Are you kidding?

102
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:02,764
I don't want them laughing at
us while I'm mixin' potions

103
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:05,285
and accidentally sendin'
plants into choking fits!

104
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:06,462
But don't you get it?

105
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:07,968
They'll have to
learn something, too.

106
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:13,200
And they won't be able to laugh
at us when they're so busy

107
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:14,749
trying to learn
stuff of their own.

108
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,648
I must admit it's kinda fun
to see them working hard

109
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,276
to get on our good
side for a change

110
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:26,612
<i>Oh my gosh, a princess</i>
<i>lives in there.</i>

111
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:28,480
And I'm about to go
inside and see her!

112
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:31,024
I can't even tell
you how excited I am!

113
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:32,764
I can't either!

114
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,460
Now remember, Twilight takes
this time out with us

115
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:39,477
so we can learn stuff.

116
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,496
Hey there, guys!
Come on in.

117
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,063
Princess Twilight!

118
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,192
Oh! It's really her!

119
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:49,441
Oh my gosh! I don't believe it!

120
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,550
Oh, and uh, you
brought guests.

121
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:53,440
Great.

122
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:57,535
Princess Twilight, it is such
a thrill and honor to be here,

123
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,679
you have no idea.

124
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:01,336
Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail?

125
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:03,328
I so have to
get that done.

126
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,133
Actually, it's not dyed.

127
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:06,220
I've always--

128
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,964
<i>Are those books in there?</i>

129
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:09,953
What a bold design choice.

130
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,396
You should so do that, Di.

131
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:13,937
I know, right?

132
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:18,265
Listen. I'm all for helping
as many ponies as I can,

133
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,550
but maybe we should keep
these weekly visits

134
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:21,914
just between us, hm?

135
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,124
OK, which one of you
wants to practice first?

136
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,089
Shouldn't they go first?

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,511
No silly, I set up Twilight
Time especially for you.

138
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:35,959
Applebloom, go ahead.

139
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,035
Let's see how your plant
potions are coming.

140
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:46,753
I can't believe I
let you talk us

141
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:48,380
into bringing
guests yesterday.

142
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,112
I didn't hear them laugh
at us once, Applebloom.

143
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,987
Because they laughed
on the inside.

144
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:53,935
Don't worry.

145
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:56,060
We won't make that
same mistake again.

146
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,011
Oh great.

147
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,517
Look who showed up
to make fun of us.

148
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,637
So much for learning
skills to be big shots.

149
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:05,461
Hey, guess what!

150
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:09,147
I told everyone about your
special Twilight time!

151
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,931
Oh no, here it comes.

152
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,179
And they all want in!

153
00:08:14,552 --> 00:08:20,101
Twilight Time! Twilight Time!

154
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,672
Thanks to me, you three are
now the hottest thing around.

155
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:25,008
You're welcome.

156
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,618
Twilight Time! Twilight Time!
Twilight Time!

157
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:28,078
Uh oh.

158
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:34,132
Twilight time! Twilight time!

159
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:37,512
Wow! All these ponies really
want to meet Twilight

160
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,450
that badly?

161
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:41,609
We love you, Cutie
Mark Crusaders!

162
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,681
<i>Now now, everypony.</i>

163
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,116
Demanding time with a
Princess as an unruly mob

164
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:52,792
simply won't do.

165
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:55,674
Might I suggest you get
organized through us,

166
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,445
the Cutie Mark Crusaders'
nearest and dearest friends?

167
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,230
Everypony get in line.

168
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:04,583
No pushing. No pushing!

169
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:08,187
What a mess.

170
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,799
Of awesome!

171
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:13,443
Don't you see? We're really
and truly and certifiably

172
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,957
the biggest of the bigshots
in school right now!

173
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:16,864
Huh?

174
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:18,860
They all think
we're the greatest

175
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:20,915
because we're their
ticket to get time with

176
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:24,733
Ponyville's newest and biggest
celebrity: Princess Twilight.

177
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:28,169
We just said like two seconds
ago that inviting two ponies

178
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:30,396
to Twilight Time
was a big mistake!

179
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,995
<i>and now we're supposed to</i>
<i>bring the whole class?</i>

180
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:33,816
Relax.

181
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:34,907
I got this.

182
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:40,819
I don't like this,
Sweetie Belle.

183
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:44,042
You said not to invite them
to Twilight Time and I didn't,

184
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,178
so what's the problem?

185
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:47,118
This feels like a trick.

186
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:50,011
What's tricky about inviting
Twilight out for a meal

187
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,542
thanking her for all the nice
things she's done for us?

188
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,075
Seems like the least
we can do for the Princess.

189
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,092
Did someone say Princess?

190
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:05,855
When I told you when you could
come eyeball the Princess

191
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:07,125
at one of her favorite hangouts,

192
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,576
I said only two or
three of you, tops.

193
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,808
<i>Oops.</i>

194
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:13,196
She's coming!

195
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:15,640
OK, but stay out of sight.

196
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,611
As you wish, Sweetie Belle.

197
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:19,639
Yes. As I wish.

198
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:25,323
Mmmm. Mmm.

199
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,761
I didn't realize
how hungry I was.

200
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:30,218
I'm so glad you asked
me to join you here today.

201
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:32,107
I'm so honored.

202
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:37,114
You are?

203
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:39,662
When you first asked me to
help you develop new skills,

204
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,675
I thought: working with young
students so devoted to the joy

205
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:44,308
of learning purely
for its own sake?

206
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:45,555
What could be better?

207
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,327
You all remind me of
myself when I was your age.

208
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,816
Yes, well, we feel
the same way.

209
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,992
That's why we invited you here.

210
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:57,974
Because of our love
of learning.

211
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:01,170
<i>Twilight!</i>

212
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,723

213
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,709
I know.

214
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:08,961
I've been so busy I forgot how
delicious everything is here.

215
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,320
Totally!

216
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,380
Hey, what's going on
out there?

217
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:16,044
Oh, never mind. They're gone.

218
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:17,761
They're back!

219
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:19,964
Never mind. They're gone.

Knock it off!

222
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,840
What in the world is
going on out--?

223
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:42,862
What was all this?

224
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,716
And this?

225
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:46,801
I couldn't help it.

226
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:49,077
When I don't smile in
a picture, I look sad.

227
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:52,003
Oh, we're gonna
look sad all right.

228
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,547
Uh, can I help you?

229
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,602
Get my picture
with her!

230
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,734
Me first!

231
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,414
Hey, get out of the shot!

232
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:12,733
This is bad.

233
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,633
Twilight's gonna be
so ticked at us.

234
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:18,195
I told you this was
a terrible idea.

235
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:21,227
You seriously all
want my autograph?

236
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:24,636
OK, I'll sign just a
couple more for you,

237
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:27,203
but then I really must get
back to my little friends.

238
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:31,808
Oh, there you are.

239
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:35,945
Wow, to think I've been to the
Hay Burger so many times

240
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:38,720
never knowing it was the
regular hangout for a Princess!

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,901
This isn't my regular hang out.

242
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:42,712
I'm only here to be with them.

243
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,968
You mean, Princess
Twilight decides

244
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:49,460
where it's cool to go
based on where they go?

245
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:50,714
Wha - ?

246
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,098
Thanks guys. This was fun.

247
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:55,701
See you around.

248
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:01,720
I'm opening a new
lemonade stand.

249
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:03,557
Won't you come to the
grand opening?

250
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:07,746
I'll give you free
lemonade for a week.

251
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:13,371
Relax. I know exactly
how to handle this.

252
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:19,732
Yippee! Lemonade!

253
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,161
More lemonade?

254
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:25,652
Don't mind if I do.

255
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:32,284
Done shining your hooves.

256
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:33,845
It's an honor to do
you the favor.

257
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:37,943
Wow, so bright I can see myself.

258
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,153
And so can I.

259
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:42,300
Nice job
bedazzling my bow.

260
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:43,356
What do I owe you?

261
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:46,093
Your gratitude is
thanks enough.

262
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:51,771
You three must come
to my pool party.

263
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,169
It'll be much
cooler than this.

264
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,312
Look who's inviting
who to her fancy house.

265
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:01,680
I believe we have arrived,
Cutie Mark Crusaders.

266
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,710
Yeah!

267
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,932
Wow, this is nice, but
there's no one else here.

268
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,773
Why is this party
cooler exactly?

269
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,742
Because of all the
ponies we're keeping out.

270
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:23,896
This has been great,
but we have to go.

271
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:25,875
It's Twilight Time.

272
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:30,035
So we're coming
too, right?

273
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,541
Um...

274
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,814
Actually no.

275
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,188
We didn't have a chance
to ask Twilight, so...

276
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:40,862
Really? After all the
favors we did for you?

277
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:44,294
After all the favors
they did for you?

278
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:47,543
Twilight Time! Twilight Time!

279
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:50,774
Twilight Time! Twilight Time!

280
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:58,374
OK. I know exactly
how to handle this.

281
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:00,185
Run!

282
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:05,877
Twilight time! Twilight time!

283
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,890
We've got to beat them to
Twilight's so we can explain.

284
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,631
This way. I know a short cut.

285
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,784
Twilight time! Twilight time!

286
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,554
Then we run...like the wind!

287
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:31,806
We made it! Quick, knock on--

288
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:45,898
Twilight, we can explain.

289
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,489
We know you said we should
just keep Twilight Time to us.

290
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,883
We didn't mean for so many
other ponies to be here.

291
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,031
Honest!

292
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:54,273
Oh, don't be silly.

293
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,097
I only meant that
for your benefit,

294
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:58,074
so you could get the most
out of our time together.

295
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:01,190
But if you want to share your
time with others, that's fine.

296
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,800
So you're not mad?

297
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,324
Of course not.

298
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:06,878
Come on in, everypony.

299
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,874
Spike made nachos.

300
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,468
Turns out we'll need
some more than that.

301
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:26,714
Before we start, we should
maybe get a bit more organized.

302
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:29,024
Ponies interested in
magic in this corner.

303
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,871
Ponies who want to learn
potions over here.

304
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,990
Bookworm
ponies over there.

305
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:36,995
Incredible.

306
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:39,974
Looks like everything's
working out just fine.

307
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:43,531
And I was so afraid Twilight
would be disappointed in us.

308
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:46,249
Told you I knew exactly
how to handle all this.

309
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:48,552
Thanks to all of you
for taking time out

310
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:50,243
to come learn new things.

311
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:52,636
Thank you, Princess!

312
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:54,101
We love you, Princess!

313
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,505
OK, OK, let's settle down.

314
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,304
If you want to thank anypony,
thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders

315
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,470
<i>for so generously</i>
<i>sharing this time.</i>

316
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:06,433
It was nothing, really.

317
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:08,417
We just felt it was
the right thing to do.

318
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:09,486
Hmph.

319
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:11,096
What a laugh.

320
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:12,848
Let's begin over here.

321
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,162
And what would you like
to learn, little one?

322
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,462
I want to learn how to
become a Cutie Mark Crusader.

323
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,446
And why do you want to become
a Cutie Mark Crusader so badly?

324
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,873
Because then I could get all my
classmates to do me favors

325
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:28,788
and stuff because I'm friends
with a famous Princess.

326
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:33,758
Hoo boy.

327
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,596
Is this true?

328
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,694
We wanted our time together
just as a way to be with you

329
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:39,728
and learn new things.

330
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:41,116
Really and truly.

331
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:42,595
Prove it.

332
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:43,615
Huh?

333
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:46,739
If it's true, then I'm sure
you've all been practicing

334
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,257
your skills over the past week.

335
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:50,154
Show me how much better you got.

336
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:55,960
Uh well, uh, we can't.

337
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:59,088
We kind of rushed over and
forgot to bring our stuff.

338
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,800
Hmm. I see.

339
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:02,928
No wait!

340
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,235
Hey everypony, you're in luck.

341
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,316
You came to learn,

342
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:08,232
but instead you're getting
dinner and a show!

343
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:11,280
Get ready, 'cause we,
the Cutie Mark Crusaders,

344
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,658
are about to lay on
you the amazing skills

345
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:15,494
we learned in Twilight Time!

346
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:24,146
Unfortunately, since we don't
have Scootaloo's unicycle parts,

347
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:25,947
she'll take apart and
put back together

348
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:27,498
one of the scooters
from outside.

349
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,935
Hey, that's my scooter!

350
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:31,877
You got us into this mess, kid.

351
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,348
Might wanna roll with us.

352
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,413
Huh?

353
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,731
<i>Applebloom doesn't have</i>
<i>her apple seedling,</i>

354
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:39,235
<i>so she'll just grab an</i>
<i>apple from the kitchen.</i>

355
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:44,101
And I will begin by using
my magic to lift this broom.

356
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,845
<i>Ta da! </i>

357
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,678
Become a tree!

358
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:05,619
Rise!

359
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:19,209
That didn't turn out
quite how I had hoped.

360
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:22,007
Looks like Twilight
Time is over.

361
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,060
And look who's not the
Princess' entourage anymore.

362
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:27,898
<i>Oooooh!</i>

363
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,772
Guess they didn't come
here to learn after all.

364
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,758
Well, neither did any of you.

365
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:36,134
Awwwww.

366
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,868
We're really sorry, Twilight.

367
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:42,667
We made a huge mistake.

368
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,112
And we really and truly
did enjoy learning

369
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,314
new skills with you.

370
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:49,502
Guess we'll just have to keep
on doing it without you now.

371
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:51,660
Thanks, Twilight.

372
00:19:58,048 --> 00:19:59,043
Thanks.

373
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:07,438
Thanks.

374
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:14,019
Sweetie Belle?

375
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,091
Remember a moment ago when you
asked me to "give you a chance?"

376
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:31,012
Awww, come on!

377
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:36,316
<i>I guess Twilight must not</i>
<i>be so super upset anymore</i>

378
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:39,155
<i>'cause she's letting us do a</i>
<i>diary entry like our sisters do.</i>

379
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,906
<i>Boy, did we get our</i>
<i>priorities mixed up.</i>

380
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:43,724
<i>We started acting special</i>

381
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:45,572
<i>because we were friends</i>
<i>with someone special.</i>

382
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,819
<i>We almost forgot the real</i>
<i>reason she's special:</i>

383
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:51,116
<i>because she's our friend.</i>

384
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:56,224
<i>But she forgave us and, like</i>
<i>magic, things are good as new.</i>

385
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:59,348
<i>That's the kind of magic I</i>
<i>really want to get good at...</i>

386
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,782
<i>now that I'm getting so</i>
<i>good at the other kind.</i>

387
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,101
Wow, all three of you have
made so much progress.

388
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:09,957
I'm really proud of you!

389
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:11,373
See you next time.

390
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:16,212
<i>We're just glad Twilight</i>
<i>Time is back to normal.</i>

391
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,643
<i>Well? Almost back to normal.</i>

392
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:21,280
I just hope no one sees us.

393
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,713
Because we're trying to keep
Twilight Time a secret now?

394
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:25,875
Or because we
look ridiculous?

395
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:27,855
A little of both,
actually.
