1
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,572
       Ha! Straight to the
        changeling hive.

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,174
    I told you I could do it.

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:11,043
        Well, not exactly
      "straight" Starlight.

4
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,012
       We've been popping
      all around Equestria

5
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,947
                and we still
                have to walk.

6
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,082
Pfft. It's like twelve
steps away.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,918
Before Chrysalis'
throne was destroyed,

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,387
the closest magic would have
gotten us was waaay over there.

9
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,894
  On a scale of one-to-ten, how
    happy do you think Thorax

10
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,030
      is going to be about
       our surprise visit?

11
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,631
         Definitely ten.

12
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,001
  I mean, who wouldn't be happy
     at the chance to marvel

13
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,404
       at the overwhelming
        talent that is...

14
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,607
 the Great and Powerful Trixie?

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,177
            Trixie, we're coming
            to offer Thorax

16
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,879
                   encouragement
                   and support.

17
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,481
   His letters make it seem like
   the responsibilities of being

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,284
    the changeling leader are
     a little overwhelming.

19
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:53,719
Yeah, I know.

20
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:55,121
That's basically what I said.

21
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,823
   He's dealing with the wants
   and needs of his subjects,

22
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,858
      redesigning the hive,

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,428
        a Dread Maulwurf
     wreaking havoc outside.

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,663
          It does sound
       like a lot, but...

25
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,565
        are you sure that
       last thing is real?

26
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,999
       The Dread Maulwurf?

27
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,001
           Sure it is.

28
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:12,037
      Thorax said it's like
      half-bear, half-mole,

29
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,240
   half-raging pile of claws.

30
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,508
  But now that the changelings
    don't feed on the love of

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,078
 everything around them, plants
   have started to grow back.

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,413
     But this Maulwurf keeps
       eating them all up.

33
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,249
Maulwurf. Uh-huh.

34
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,751
You're just trying
to scare me.

35
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,320
But it won't work
because not only am I

36
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:34,426
  the Great and Powerful, I am
  also the Unscareable Trixie!

37
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:35,961
        Rahr!

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,400
  [gasp] Please tell me Thorax also
 mentioned a terrifying-looking

39
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,903
 changeling who greets visitors
      but is actually nice?

40
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:45,304
                    Nope.

41
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,506
        And I'm not nice.

42
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,950
      Starlight, you got us
    here, I'll take us home.

43
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,052
    Teleportation spell, go!

44
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:01,920
   Trixie: Did I save us?

45
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:02,754
                      Starlight: Nope.

46
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,601
What are you
waiting for?

47
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,637
Use some magic to
get us out of here!

48
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,906
                 Calm down,
             Unscareable Trixie.

49
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,974
             Huh. We have to find out
              what's going on.

50
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,442
                   Thorax might
                  need our help.

51
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,844
We need our help!

52
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:02,647
Teleportation spell, go!
Teleportation spell, go!

53
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:04,616
Teleportation spell...

54
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,652
                 Ugh. Why do you keep
                   doing that?

55
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,087
             You know it doesn't
               work that way.

56
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,288
I know! But this
 is my process.

57
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,323
              Gah!

58
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,625
I captured these
trespassers.

59
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,693
                      Thorax: Starlight?

60
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:15,894
             Trixie?

61
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,296
        It's OK, Pharynx.

62
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:18,364
      You can let them go.

63
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,632
But they were lurking
on our grounds!

64
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,802
In the old days, I would have
already feasted on their love.

65
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,138
    Well, that's why they're
      called the old days.

66
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,573
      Because they're old.

67
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,741
    We don't do that anymore.

68
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,347
Ugh. I liked the old days better.

69
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,917
What are you
two doing here?

70
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,619
                   We wanted to
                   surprise you.

71
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,654
                     Surprise..!

72
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,290
  Well, it's great to see you.

73
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,759
       I'm sorry about the
       welcome committee.

74
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,631
     I thought Ember helped
     you get more assertive

75
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,766
   so you could deal with all
    the renegade changelings

76
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,034
   who didn't want to change?

77
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,337
  Oh, she did. Really helpful.

78
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,706
     I was able to convince
    all of them to change...

79
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,607
       except one of them.

80
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,809
           My brother.

81
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,077
                   Your brother?

82
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,046
       Yep. Pharynx is my
        elder brood mate.

83
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,684
                    Oh, yeah.

84
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,452
       You guys have the same...

85
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:16,355
                    ...eye shape?

86
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,259
What a ridiculous comparison.
We are nothing alike.

87
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,829
                Stop doing that!

88
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,898
         The hive looked
       better with holes...

89
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,772
Uh. Well, how about I show
you the rest of the hive

90
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,640
where it's less
loud and bang-y?

91
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,013
 There've been a lot of changes
    since you were here last.

92
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,915
  I'm trying to start some new
 activities since the only thing

93
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,084
        we did before was
        hunt and patrol.

94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,253
       There's theater...

95
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,421
         ...swing dancing,

96
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,459
          a once-a-week
        potluck lunch...

97
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:57,662
  Ooh! And who can change shape
    and organize craft time?

98
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,032
                     This guy!

99
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,134
 I am really impressed, Thorax.

100
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,735
 The hive, all the activities...

101
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,737
           Agh! He did it again!

102
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,874
    Pharynx dumped an entire
    can of black paint on me!

103
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,944
 He said my fuchsia color wasn't
 "intimidating to our enemies."

104
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,346
          What enemies!?

105
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,315
I am so sorry.

106
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,883
I promise I'll
 talk to him.

107
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,918
       You're the ruler of
        the hive, Thorax.

108
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,187
         You need to do
         more than talk!

109
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:26,591
   Well.. maybe not everything
        here is amazing.

110
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,460
       Seriously, Thorax.

111
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,996
  What is up with your brother?

112
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,832
     [sigh] Pharynx used to
       be Head of Patrol.

113
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,435
   But now we're peaceful and
   there's no need to patrol,

114
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:40,139
  so he just stalks around the
 hive making everyone miserable.

115
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,242
 The other changelings are sick
  of it and if I can't get him

116
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,612
  to accept love and friendship
 and change like the rest of us,

117
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,680
      everything I've done
        here is at risk.

118
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,416
              Uh uh!

119
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,618
Mmmmm....?

120
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,120
                      [sigh] Uh huh...

121
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,223
We know a thing or two about
what it's like to be outsiders.

122
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,958
Maybe we could talk
to him for you.

123
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,527
          Do you really
      think you could help?

124
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,663
   Thorax, if there's anypony
  who can help your brother...

125
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:05,598
                     it's me.

126
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,101
 And with Starlight helping, it
   might take slightly longer,

127
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,970
         but I guarantee
        you we can do it.

128
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,008
Thorax, we're ready to start
work on the trail of plants

129
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,276
to lead the Maulwurf away.

130
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,078
         Oh. I have to head outside.

131
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,947
       You're sure you're
      OK handling Pharynx?

132
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,281
                 Absolutely!

133
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,824
                Yeah. We totally
                    got this!

134
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,869
So. How do you
want to play this?

135
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,405
I'm thinking good
pony/bad pony.

136
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,707
You yell and blast
him with magic,

137
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,544
while my natural charisma
will convince him that--

138
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,380
   Starlight?

139
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,116
Hey, Pharynx.

140
00:06:57,318 --> 00:07:00,752
    I know when we first met,
     it didn't go so well...

141
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,120
             I put you in a bag.

142
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,288
        I thought it went great.

143
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,165
Yah!

144
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,958
          Right. [ahem]

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,428
       So... not a big fan
       of the vines, huh?

146
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,796
    They're a safety hazard.

147
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,565
   An enemy could hide in them
     or use them as weapons.

148
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,267
        I don't even know
        why they're here.

149
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,768
Because they're pretty?

150
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,103
              That's ridiculous.

151
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,205
    Oh. Totally.

152
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,540
We get you.

153
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:26,311
But ahem.. maybe don't express how
you feel by destroying them?

154
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,213
       I don't take advice
          from ponies.

155
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,750
      The only thing I take
     from you is breakfast.

156
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,751
       At least I used to.

157
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,953
              You know, you're a
                 lot like us.

158
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:35,887
            Doubt it.

159
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,290
           Trixie: It's true.

160
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,592
         Do you know who
      Twilight Sparkle is?

161
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,292
               No.

162
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,929
           Well, she's the most
           well-liked, studious,

163
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,198
                do-goodiest pony
                  in Equestria.

164
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,133
        Ugh. She sounds awful.

165
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,901
                 Oh, you'd hate
                 her. I used to.

166
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,103
        She made me unsure about
         my place in the world,

167
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,039
             which led me to act
              out against her.

168
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:58,143
And I used to be a dictator who
ran a village with an iron hoof!

169
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:02,847
     Really? Hmm. Maybe you
      two do understand me.

170
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,083
 Yes! We do!

171
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,919
But now, Trixie has come to
terms with being second-best...

172
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,290
     And I no longer control
   ponies against their will.

173
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,359
      And our lives are so
       much better for it.

174
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,096
   Wow. So you're both losers.

175
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,533
  Stay away from me or I'll do
 to you what I did to the vines.

176
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,939
Well, operation Lead Maulwurf
away is coming along.

177
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,641
How'd it go with Pharynx?

178
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,612
Your brother is...um,
    challenging.

179
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,213
Oh. That bad, huh?

180
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,281
                It wasn't great.

181
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,016
You want to talk it out?

182
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,986
You can come with me
to the Feelings Forum.

183
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,488
          The Feeling what, now?

184
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,458
  Oh. It's a place for changelings
    to express their feelings

185
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,494
     so we all gain a better
  understanding of each other.

186
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,030
    It's really helped bring
    the hive closer together.

187
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,235
     <i> Sometimes I feel like</i>
     <i> I'm a blue changeling.</i>

188
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,738
      Sometimes I feel like
    I'm a purple changeling.

189
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,273
         But here I am,
          a green one.

190
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,776
You can be anything
  you want to be.

191
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,212
       Be blue one day and
        purple the next.

192
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,414
    Be both on the same day!

193
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,983
      But then I feel like
      I'd be living a lie.

194
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,154
It's very brave of you to
share something so personal.

195
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,691
      Does anyone else have
        similar concerns?

196
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:23,494
  I used to, but craft time has
 given me such a creative outlet

197
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,663
        I feel great now.

198
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,831
      Everyone loves craft time.

199
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:29,835
   Well...

200
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,337
everyone except
for you-know-who.

201
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,807
  Yeah. You-know-who spends all
  his craft time making spears.

202
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,377
  He's scary and intimidating.

203
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,780
       You-know-who makes
        me uncomfortable.

204
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,848
He makes us all
uncomfortable!

205
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,018
       Everyone, please, I
       understand Pharynx

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,787
       can be challenging
           at times--

207
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,155
            That's an
         understatement.

208
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,090
          He lined the
      hallway with thorns!

209
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,293
  He teaches little changelings
       to growl and hiss!

210
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,928
       My soup's too hot!

211
00:09:59,197 --> 00:09:59,731
What?

212
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,233
I thought the Feelings Forum
was for sharing our problems?

213
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,004
    It sounds like your lame
  Feelings Forum is for talking

214
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,939
    about me behind my back.

215
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,276
    The Feelings Forum is for
     talking about anything

216
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,811
      that's bothering you.

217
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,947
    Is there something you'd
     like to share, Pharynx?

218
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,349
       Actually, there is.

219
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,385
      The changelings used
     to be a fearsome swarm.

220
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,388
 Now we sit around talking about
      our feelings so much

221
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,956
       you can't even stop
           a Maulwurf

222
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,225
         from eating all
       your pretty plants.

223
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,694
I could've sent that
thing packing before,

224
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,963
     but I guess now, we'll
    just try to lead it away

225
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,233
  and hope that keeps us safe!

226
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,502
        I don't feel safe
        with him around.

227
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,471
                 I'd feel safer
                if he were gone.

228
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,105
        I can't do that.

229
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,107
      We want him banished!

230
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,079
   Hey! My soup's cooled down!

231
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,649
    These Feelings Forums are
   great for solving problems!

232
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,488
   Everyone, please, if we are
    interrupting each other,

233
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,058
      we are not affirming
           each other.

234
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,964
That's it! Feelings
  Forum is over!

235
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:20,278
I....whew. I want to say something,
but it goes against everything

236
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,013
      I've been taught as
       Twilight's pupil.

237
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,950
                 Oooh. Then by all
                 means, say it.

238
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,421
I think Pharynx is
   a lost cause.

239
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,924
       Mm. I'm all for second
      chances, third even,

240
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,794
        but he just seems
         like a bad bug.

241
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,396
And Thorax has a duty
to the whole hive,

242
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,798
not just his brother.

243
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,766
            If he keeps sticking
               up for Pharynx,

244
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,569
the hive might decide they don't
  want Thorax as their leader.

245
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,505
I think he might have
to kick Pharynx out,

246
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,041
but I don't want to be the
one to tell Thorax that.

247
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:55,014
    Me neither! But somepony
        probably should.

248
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,716
                 I nominate you!

249
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:58,683
Ugh..

250
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,559
Thorax... we have
something to tell you.

251
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,028
  It's about Pharynx, isn't it?

252
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,232
        Mmmmmmmmaybe?

253
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,467
      Look, I know he's an
    aggressive warrior type,

254
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,203
     but when I was little,
     every young changeling

255
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,505
     wanted to be like that.

256
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,682
          <i> Every young</i>
     <i> changeling except me.</i>

257
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,484
  <i> The others would pick on me</i>
   <i> for not wanting to fight.</i>

258
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,422
     Look at the little grub
    playing with his dollies.

259
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,228
                  Step away from
                    my brother.

260
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,532
       <i> But Pharynx never</i>
       <i> let them hurt me.</i>

261
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,701
    Heh heh.. We were just
   complimenting his dollies.

262
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,713
        Thanks, Pharynx.

263
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,281
                  Why are you
               hitting yourself?

264
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,415
          Stop hitting yourself.

265
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,550
                  Why are you
               hitting yourself?

266
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:06,718
   Ow! Ouch!

267
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,587
Cut it out, Pharynx!

268
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,488
    They're right, you know.

269
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,956
        You need to have
          tougher skin.

270
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:20,098
Awwww. That was a really sweet
story...until the end.

271
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,868
            I know Pharynx loved
             me, in his own way.

272
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,570
              And I know there's
              still good in him.

273
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,439
        That's why I keep
      sticking up for him.

274
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,241
      Anyway, what did you
    want to talk to me about?

275
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,877
       Me? No...

276
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,347
But Starlight has
something she'd--

277
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,316
Actually, Thorax, um...

278
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,117
           never mind.

279
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,519
     Come on, Trixie, we've
      got a... thing to do.

280
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,423
What are you doing?

281
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,725
I thought we agreed
you'd tell Thorax

282
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,961
he had to kick his
brother out of the hive.

283
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,763
         Maybe we don't have to.

284
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,764
         Get Pharynx and meet me
          at the hive entrance.

285
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:54,899
        I'll explain everything.

286
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,437
And how am I supposed to
know where Pharynx is?

287
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,839
                  I just saw
                   Pharynx.

288
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,375
    Oh. Well, that was easy.

289
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,651
          We'll just use one
       problem to solve another.

290
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,119
      I switched the trail
        of plants around

291
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,421
   to lure the Maulwurf here.

292
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,456
   The changelings may not be
    able to stop it anymore,

293
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,058
   but Pharynx certainly can.

294
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,860
     When it attacks, he'll
        save his brother,

295
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,361
        showing everypony
         his good side.

296
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,430
   The others will accept him
    and Pharynx will finally

297
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,800
  let love and friendship into
     his life and transform!

298
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,535
     Wow.

299
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,402
                I know, right?

300
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,737
                  Great idea.

301
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,006
        Where's Pharynx?

302
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,240
           He's gone.

303
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,709
        Gone like gone to
        the throne room?

304
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,111
Gone like gone.

305
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,481
One of the changelings said
Pharynx left the hive for good.

306
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:50,288
[gasp] Then who's going to stop the
Dread Maulwurf I'm leading here!?

307
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,231
     Thorax! There you are!

308
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,700
       Pharynx is missing!

309
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,904
                 Wait for it...

310
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,439
    --and the Dread Maulwurf
       is coming this way!

311
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:11,977
                    Told ya.

312
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,945
    That doesn't make any sense.

313
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,216
 The trail of plants should have
  lead the Dread Maulwurf away.

314
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:22,053
Heh... I might have re-laid them to
lead it back toward the hive.

315
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,688
          Why would you do that!?

316
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,191
  I thought if Pharynx saw you
   were in danger, the loving,

317
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,827
  caring side of him would come
   out when he protected you.

318
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,228
                But instead he's
                 out there alone

319
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,797
        somewhere between us and
         that rampaging monster?

320
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,365
             I have to save him.

321
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,467
      I'm coming with you.

322
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,268
Of course you are.

323
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,937
This is all your fault.

324
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,307
               Oh, don't be too
              hard on Starlight.

325
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,542
                Her heart was in
                the right place.

326
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:45,777
       You're coming too!

327
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,045
           Oh. Right.

328
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,414
       I mean, I was gonna
        volunteer anyway...

329
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,416
       Who else is coming?

330
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,754
              Ugh. Fine.

331
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,759
       Oh, sure, you could
         all stay here.

332
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,895
     Not help Pharynx and he
    won't bother you anymore.

333
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,497
        It's your choice.

334
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,333
      But remember when you
      didn't have a choice.

335
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,569
      When you were forced
       to obey Chrysalis.

336
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:15,173
You might have been unstoppable,
 but you weren't free to choose.

337
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,941
        And now you are.

338
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,643
       Because of Thorax.

339
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,146
         Well, it's his
       brother out there.

340
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:24,115
   And now it's your chance to
   prove you're just as strong

341
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,252
      embracing love as you
       were feeding on it.

342
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,456
 Now is your chance to show what
   changelings can really be.

343
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:36,260
    Not because you have to,
   but because you choose to!

344
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,533
      That was an amazingly
     epic speech, Starlight.

345
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:44,068
    I just can't believe not
       a single changeling

346
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,570
        was moved by it.

347
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,005
       I can't blame them.

348
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,108
   If he wasn't my brother, I
    don't think I'd be here.

349
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,977
   We're going to have to face
   the Maulwurf by ourselves.

350
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,412
    Maybe it'll be long gone

351
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,281
     and we'll find Pharynx
         out here alone.

352
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:01,953
                  Or maybe not.

353
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:15,867
                        Pharynx!

354
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,302
    What are you doing here?

355
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,836
      I'm here to save you!

356
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,206
        Get out of here!

357
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,607
       Let me handle this!

358
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,642
          We're not leaving you!

359
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,456
 Ahh. I may have forgot to mention in
    my letters that Maulwurfs

360
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,124
    have really thick hides.

361
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,865
          I thought you said you
          could beat this thing!

362
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,067
         Yeah, with the
       rest of the swarm.

363
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,301
           Not alone!

364
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,570
  Changeling: Good thing you're not alone!

365
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,543
               I told you it was
                an epic speech.

366
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,359
          It's no use!

367
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,527
      We're out of practice
       and he's too tough!

368
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,433
           And strong.

369
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,803
      Too bad we can't get
       it to fight itself.

370
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,171
           That's it!

371
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,972
        Thorax! Remember
       when we were young

372
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,541
  and I made you hit yourself?

373
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,811
     Now is not the time to
    make fun of me, Pharynx!

374
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,614
      Oh! Right! Of course!

375
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:40,852
Why are you
hitting yourself?

376
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,320
           Why are you
        hitting yourself?

377
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,822
                  Why are you
               hitting yourself?

378
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,323
                 Yeah, Maulwurf.

379
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,424
  Why are you hitting yourself?

380
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,260
       Why are you hitting
       yourself, huh? Huh? Huh?

381
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:57,769
Oooh. That looks
 like it hurts.

382
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,774
      We did it! It's gone!

383
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,380
                  What were you
                 doing out here?

384
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,882
        Leaving. I'm done
        with all of you.

385
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:12,784
               Oh.

386
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,220
      It's just, why bother
   fighting the Maulwurf then?

387
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,589
                  You could have
                  left it alone.

388
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,091
Well, I couldn't just
let it attack you!

389
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,227
   But I thought you were done
  with us and you didn't care.

390
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,529
       I never said that!

391
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,931
      The hive is the thing
       I care about most.

392
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,000
             Well, you certainly
             don't act like it.

393
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,670
Well, I'm sorry if I don't get
excited about pretty flowers

394
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,505
and Feelings Circles and-

395
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,207
          It's a Feelings Forum.

396
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,443
 Whatever. It
doesn't matter.

397
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,111
Even if I do care
about the hive,

398
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,714
I obviously don't have
a place there anymore.

399
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,916
        Actually, you do.

400
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,585
    Because we've been wrong.

401
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,320
     Um. The hive may be a
     gentler, nicer place...

402
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,490
But that doesn't mean we won't
have to defend ourselves.

403
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:53,892
            Clearly.

404
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,695
  And who better to help us do
  that than the only changeling

405
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,564
        who never stopped
         protecting us?

406
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,503
         You all... want
           me to stay?

407
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,573
           Unless you still want
            to leave the hive.

408
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,008
     Why would I want that?

409
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,242
        I love the hive!

410
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,958
           He did it!

411
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,527
         He transformed!

412
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,362
               I always knew you
                had it in you!

413
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,265
  Really? Because I thought you
     said I was a lost cause

414
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,634
   and you were going to tell
  Thorax he should kick me out.

415
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,804
           Oh! Starlight!

416
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,940
How could you say that?

417
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,808
                  Ah! Wha? That's...

418
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,443
                    I-I mean...

419
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,211
                  but you...

420
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,681
        Lucky for us, you
      weren't a lost cause.

421
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,717
Lucky for me, you
didn't give up on me.

422
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:00,825
      So... Glad everything
           worked out.

423
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,061
Yeah. Let's talk about how you
not only lead the Maulwurf

424
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,266
to the hive, but also drove
my brother away from it?

425
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:11,336
       I am so sorry about that.

426
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,772
  But I would like to point out
that my admittedly terrible plan

427
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,442
      did bring everything
      together in the end... huh?

428
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,610
Hey, do you guys want
to hear the story

429
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,813
about how I used to make
Thorax hit himself?

430
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:23,848
     Oh! Absolutely. Yes. Right now!

431
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,250
Well, when we were young,

432
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,552
every changeling wanted
to be a warrior.

433
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:29,988
Except for Thorax...

434
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,890
He was a little weak..
but I had to protect...
