1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,006
      Celestia: It is time
        for us to retire.

2
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,475
    And you want ME
    to take your place?

3
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,910
   With the help of
    your friends, of course.

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,681
          You may call
           me.. Grogar.

5
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:19,118
       Together, Equestria
        will be ours.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,554
  Sombra: I will take back the
  Crystal Empire on my own!

7
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:23,989
      Spike: How are we
       going to stop them?

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,624
       Twilight: With the
      Elements of Harmony!

9
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,893
       With those, we can
       defeat anypony.

10
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,848
What. Just. Happened!

11
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,452
    The Tree of Harmony can't
     really be gone, can it?

12
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,253
          It can't be...

13
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,757
          But it is! You thought
          you'd defeated me,

14
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,392
but you led
me right to

15
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,127
the source of
your power!

16
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,362
Now that it's
destroyed,

17
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,698
nothing can stop me!

18
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,336
       He's right. With
       the Elements gone,

19
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,271
      I don't know how
       we can defeat him.

20
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,608
  Then we'll just have to beat
   him the old-fashioned way!

21
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,863
              Hey!

22
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,366
     Ha! You're no match for me!

23
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,203
       I will finally rule
       the Crystal Empire.

24
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:24,343
 Wait. With you out of the way,
  I will rule all of Equestria!

25
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:25,444
               NO!

26
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:30,415
   Oh, yes. And I think I know
    exactly where I'll start!

27
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,151
     Don't you dare say it!

28
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,454
  Your sweet little home town.

29
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,956
   You leave Ponyville alone!

30
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,158
            Or what?

31
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,362
 Without your Elements, it would
 be so easy to control you.

32
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:49,802
      But there's no point,

33
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:54,306
   my conquering Ponyville is
   already your greatest fear!

34
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,742
                    Ha ha ha ha!

35
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,643
     NO!

36
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,114
         What do we do!?

37
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,850
    I don't know. The Tree of
   Harmony grew the Elements;

38
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,552
      it kept the Everfree
      Forest under control.

39
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,887
       And now it's gone.

40
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,655
        Sombra will take
         over Equestria,

41
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,157
     and it's all my fault.

42
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,993
   I knew I wasn't ready to
   take the Princesses' place,

43
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,496
    but I never thought
     I'd mess up this badly!

44
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,601
       What are you
       looking at me for?

45
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,603
         This is usually when
         you say something funny

46
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,105
            to lift our spirits.

47
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,441
Sorry, nothing about
this is funny to me.

48
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,712
I'm sorry, I'm
trying to be strong,

49
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,981
but I just can't bear to think
about poor Sweetie Belle

50
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,583
under the spell
of that monster.

51
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,752
       Or those sweet
       little Cake twins.

52
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,021
     Or Spike or Starlight.

53
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:47,025
  Or Angel or anypony forced
  to do that monster's bidding!

54
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,328
           What the--

55
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,031
  Twilight, what are you doing?

56
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,266
    We can't just stay here.

57
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,835
 I don't have a plan and I don't
 know what I'm going to do

58
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,104
     once we get out, but
     we can't just sit here

59
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,207
   and let Sombra make slaves
     of every pony we love.

60
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,542
    Let me help. I'm faster.

61
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,979
I like digging!

62
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,918
       I've been known to
      get my hooves dirty.

63
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,019
        Move over, y'all!

64
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,155
    Normally I wouldn't dream
  of digging, but right now...

65
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,290
       Show me the muddy!

66
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,410
                    Apple Bloom!

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,680
                It's me. Look at
                me, sugarcube!

68
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,050
             Twilight, you gotta
             free her! Please!

69
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,061
       I-I-can't. Without
        the Elements,

70
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,797
    my magic isn't strong
    enough to stop Sombra's!

71
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:00,437
             Spike!

72
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,971
      Spike, where are you
       going? Starlight?

73
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,040
 [robotic] We must lay siege to Canterlot.

74
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,909
  No! Snap out of it, you two!

75
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,044
 You're stronger than his magic.

76
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,113
       Rarity: Sweetie
       Belle, please stop!

77
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,015
    I can't get her to stop.
    I can't get her to--

78
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,951
       None of us can. We
       can't reach them.

79
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,730
  He made them bake a black
  licorice fruitcake that says

80
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,865
     "Congratulations to our
    favorite Supreme Emperor,

81
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,201
        King Sombra!" in
         green frosting!

82
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,671
        IT'S THE UGLIEST
      CAKE I'VE EVER SEEN!

83
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,444
       Twilight, this is
      bad. Like really bad.

84
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:49,348
       I've never been so
      sad in my whole life.

85
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,550
   I don't know what to do. I
   don't know how to free them

86
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,152
        and I don't know
       how to stop Sombra!

87
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,388
   Everypony was so sure
    I'd do such a great job!

88
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,523
      Well, this is exactly
      what I was afraid of.

89
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,859
       Could anything else
       possibly go wrong!?

90
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,995
       Well, with the Tree
        of Harmony gone,

91
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,864
     the Everfree Forest
    could grow out of control

92
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,199
     and threaten the town!

93
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,968
                 Darling, that's
                 oddly specific.

94
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,015
      Even if we figure out
      how to defeat Sombra

95
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,984
       and bring everypony
       back to Ponyville,

96
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,319
  if we don't stop the forest,

97
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,588
    there won't be a
   Ponyville to come back to!

98
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,328
              Rainbow: Ahem.

99
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,136
        For our friends.

100
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,704
        For our families.

101
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,272
For our home.

102
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,241
For Equestria!

103
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,144
           All: Equestriaaaa!

104
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,795
       You! Break it down.

105
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:30,048
     They've fled. Celestia
    and Luna are too cowardly

106
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:36,554
     to even stand against
     me. Equestria is MINE!

107
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,108
       Come on, everypony!

108
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,887
  We've been at this for hours,

109
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,956
      but it's just growin'
     back too fast!

110
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,124
     We have to keep trying!

111
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,738
    I know we're supposed to
   be able to handle things

112
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,873
      on our own, but I've
       never been happier

113
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,941
        to see two ponies
        in my whole life!

114
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,245
   [zap] Nopony is meant to
    handle this on their own.

115
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,380
       Starswirl! The Tree
       of Harmony, it's--

116
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,917
  I know. I alerted the
 princesses as soon as I could.

117
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,086
  I felt it, when it happened.

118
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,523
     Like part of my essence
     just ceased to be.

119
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,226
I know what you mean. I'm sorry.

120
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,028
Don't be. I've more
than enough magic in me

121
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,631
to keep the Everfree
Forest under control.

122
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,665
        You can do that?

123
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,134
The Pillars and I planted
the Tree of Harmony.

124
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,870
Who do you think kept
the Forest under control

125
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,272
before it did?

126
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,076
It will take time,

127
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,810
  but with the Princesses'
   help, I can keep it at bay.

128
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,620
  Aw, yeah! Go get 'em, Beardy!

129
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,897
  Sombra's back and he's taken
 control of all of our friends!

130
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,200
      We've left Canterlot
       defenseless!

131
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,937
     Twilight, you must
      go! Defend Equestria

132
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,773
      and we shall
       contain the forest.

133
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,508
     At least now we're back
      to just one problem.

134
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,989
   Aw, everypony's all evil-y.

135
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,191
Sombra's going
to force us

136
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,460
to fight our way
through our friends?

137
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,995
Not if I can help it!

138
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,813
OK. Guess we need a
different plan. Twilight?

139
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,048
   I don't know! I'm not
    prepared to fight against

140
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,884
   the citizens of Equestria.

141
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,987
   I guess that's one more
   thing I'm not ready to do.

142
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,155
    Well, we'd better figure
     out something quick

143
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,658
    because none of them seem
   to have a problem with it.

144
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,304
 Oooh! Sorry about this, Fancy Pants!

145
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,978
   We promise we'll let y'all
   out as soon as we can!

146
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,551
         Will I go here?

147
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,886
            Or here?

148
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,855
        Or here or there!

149
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,824
              Huh?

150
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,171
             Gotcha!

151
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,276
      I don't know how long
      we can hold them off.

152
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,478
    And holding them off
   isn't what we need anyhow.

153
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,080
     We need to get inside.

154
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,882
        But we can't just
        leave them here,

155
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,984
  all possessed and Sombrafied.

156
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,719
    What do we do, Twilight?

157
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,288
       I don't know, but
       we can't stay here.

158
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,427
      I'm sorry we couldn't
      help our friends,

159
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,162
        but I didn't know
        what else to do.

160
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,697
     At least we're inside.

161
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:43,602
   Yeah. All we have to do
   now is defeat King Sombra. [nervous chuckle]

162
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,636
            I-- we--

163
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:51,409
      Oh, my. No Elements?
        No princesses?

164
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,912
      Seems like you're in
       a bit of a pickle.

165
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,448
      Or are you in [snap]
       more of a jam?

166
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,720
        Discord! What are
         you doing here!?

167
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,655
  Well, I was going to hang
  these up all over the castle

168
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,758
  to celebrate your coronation,

169
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,928
      but apparently, it's
      a bit premature.

170
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,464
     I'm so glad to see you!

171
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,999
       We could really use
        some all-powerful

172
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,735
 Lord of Chaos' help right now!

173
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,405
  Moi? Oh, I couldn't possibly.

174
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,445
Aw, poodles!

175
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,451
        Discord, <i>please</i>?

176
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,187
           Ugh. Fine.

177
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:38,489
 Just to be clear, I was really
 rooting for you to do this

178
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,493
     on your own and parlay
     that confidence boost

179
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:45,564
 into being the best Protectors
 of Equestria you can be.

180
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,466
    A little less talking and
     a little more helping!

181
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:57,642
       Oh! Thank you, Discord!

182
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,844
      I don't know what
      we'd do without you.

183
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:13,258
     OK, "King" Sombra. Time
      to give up the crown.

184
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,762
  Here to fight the good fight
   with nothing but your wits?

185
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,764
     Admirable, but foolish.

186
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,132
               Ha!

187
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:28,273
      Well, I guess it's on
     me to be the MVP today.

188
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,677
    I was betting on you, and
     I do hate being wrong.

189
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,245
 Although if you think about it,

190
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:39,718
  I am your friend so maybe you
  win because friendship wins?

191
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,487
 Although Fluttershy should
get most of the credit for that.

192
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,622
       She's my favorite.

193
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,965
         [gasp] Discord!

194
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,509
   Not even the Lord of Chaos
  can stand against me!

195
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,813
  I am truly the most powerful
  creature in Equestria!

196
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,451
            Discord!

197
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:13,919
          We need you!

198
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,254
 Oh! Please wake up. Please wake up.

199
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,759
            [gasp] Discord!

200
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,463
    I'm so glad you're OK. We
   can't beat him without you.

201
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:27,232
        You couldn't beat
       me with him either!

202
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,704
      It would appear that
       you're on your own.

203
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,911
  I have nothing left to give..

204
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,913
  That's it then. We're doomed?

205
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,715
       Of course you are!

206
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,718
  I can't believe it's taken
  you this long to realize it!

207
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,889
    Now, how shall I
   eliminate all this clutter

208
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,524
       in my throne room?

209
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,696
Listen to me. You don't need me.

210
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:59,631
  You don't need the princesses

211
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,134
     and you certainly don't
       need the Elements.

212
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:06,037
      Fluttershy, you will
      always be kind.

213
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,940
       Applejack, you will
        always be honest.

214
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,478
       Rarity, you'll
       always be generous.

215
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,982
      And Rainbow Dash will
       be loyal as can be.

216
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:21,653
    Pinkie will always bring
   laughter wherever she goes

217
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:27,292
      and Twilight, [wheeze] you are
       and always will be

218
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,561
    the embodiment of Magic.

219
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,598
     You lost sight of
     what's in front of you.

220
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,801
     You're here, together,
      willing to give

221
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,738
        everything you've
       got for Equestria.

222
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,676
  Nothing and no pony can ever
   take that away from you

223
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,213
   because that's who you are.

224
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,650
     It's going to take more
    than a sentimental speech

225
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,052
          to save you.

226
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,355
   Discord's right. We've
   proven time and time again

227
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,559
   that the real magic is the
   six of us working together.

228
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:04,095
  With these girls by my
  side, I'm not afraid of you.

229
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,332
 I'm not afraid of what you can
 do or how much power you have!

230
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:08,599
         You should be.

231
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,672
You may knock us down, but we're
 going to get back up again.

232
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,376
           And again.

233
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,447
       And again. As long
       as we're together,

234
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,715
       we will never stop
      trying to defeat you!

235
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,191
        For our friends.

236
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,259
        For our families.

237
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,294
          For our Home.

238
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,996
         For Equestria!

239
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:47,238
   No! This can't be possible!
  Your magic can't defeat mine!

240
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,442
       I destroyed the
      source of your power!

241
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,212
      You can't destroy our
       friendship, Sombra.

242
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,215
  And we keep telling bad guys.

243
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,385
      But y'all just don't
        seem to remember.

244
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,387
      Friendship IS magic!

245
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,897
               Noooooooo!

246
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,951
     Ooh! Do you want more juice?

247
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:37,188
    Only if it's not too much
     trouble, and it's red,

248
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,892
 and it has one of those little
  umbrellas, and two cherries.

249
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:45,831
 No no. Actually make it three.
 And maybe..... some doughnuts?

250
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,300
       I see you've made
       yourselves at home.

251
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,437
    Celestia! Luna! I know
    what you're going to say.

252
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,605
     I should have called on
     you as soon as I knew

253
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,074
      how dangerous it was.

254
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,644
   A good leader knows when to
   ask for help and I didn't.

255
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,981
   And because of me, the Tree
    of Harmony was destroyed.

256
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,650
   Equestria deserves somepony
    much better than me

257
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,618
         as its leader.

258
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,953
          You're right.

259
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:09,821
               Oh!

260
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:14,325
 About one thing. A good leader
   knows when to ask for help.

261
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,362
     But a great leader has
      the courage to admit

262
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,797
          when they've
         made a mistake

263
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,166
        and the strength
        to make it right.

264
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,335
     Today, you've proven to
      me beyond any doubt,

265
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,337
       that you will be a
       great leader.

266
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,739
            Will be?

267
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,675
     Luna and I have decided
      it may have been

268
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,111
     a bit unfair to thrust
      this upon you

269
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,780
   without giving you the
    time you need to prepare.

270
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,251
      Oh, thank goodness! I
      really wasn't ready.

271
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,488
    Not ready!? So Twilight's
    not taking over?

272
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,056
    This was all for nothing?

273
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,291
       I pretended to be
       very hurt and gave

274
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,427
   one of the most convincing
    speeches of-

275
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,029
           PRETENDED?

276
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,499
     Of course. You don't
    think some would-be-king

277
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,135
     could actually hurt the
     Lord of Chaos, do you?

278
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:00,271
   Anyway, as I was saying, I
    pretended to be very hurt

279
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,740
    to convince you that
    you didn't need anything

280
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,976
       but yourself to be
      the incredible leader

281
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,680
     I know you can be! And
     now it's not happening!?

282
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,350
 It will, but when she's ready.

283
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,485
    How can she not be ready!?

284
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:17,989
   What a waste of a perfectly
    wonderful speech!

285
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,725
     Oh! Honestly, I don't know
       why I even bother!

286
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:25,129
     Ah! So he could have ended
     the whole Sombra thing

287
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,631
       whenever he wanted!

288
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,367
 But he didn't because he cares.

289
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,770
     That's Discord for you.

290
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,139
He sure has a weird way
of being supportive.

291
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,708
                 Super odd dude.

292
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,777
          I heard that.

293
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,784
  Also, truth be told, Celestia
    and I had fun today,

294
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,654
   fighting side-by-side with
   Starswirl for our home!

295
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,623
It's been years since we've
 gotten to do what you girls do.

296
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,126
  You all make it look so easy.

297
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,363
      Well, we are kind of
        an awesome team.

298
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,798
         Every adventure
        is heart-pounding

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,267
        but so rewarding!

300
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,804
  I'm up for anything, as long
  as it's with all of you!

301
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,074
      Life certainly hasn't
     been dull since we met.

302
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,276
   Nowhere else I'd rather be.

303
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,278
      We are pretty
      incredible together.

304
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,646
     And we would do
     anything for Equestria.

305
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,349
      I guess I know,
      when the time comes,

306
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,051
   as long as we're
     together, we probably--

307
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,520
              Ahem!

308
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,789
    --we definitely got this.

309
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,432
     Now, I'll say something
      nice about centaurs.

310
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,635
    Tirek, you say something
     nice about changelings.

311
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,304
  And Chrysalis, you say
  something nice about ponies.

312
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,272
                     NEVER!

313
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,246
  Let us hope the three of you
  will be enough for my plans.

314
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,482
        And what of King Sombra?

315
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,318
Did he succeed?

316
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,519
               HA!

317
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,363
  I'd say he gambled and lost.

318
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,465
       But at least he can
       serve as a warning

319
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,568
    to those who doubt
    continuing with my plans.

320
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,972
 Unless any of you have doubts...

321
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,906
             Uh. Not I.

322
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:16,607
               No!

323
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,442
            I'm good.

324
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,678
   Then we shall join
    forces and work together

325
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,481
       to bring Equestria
       to its knees!
