1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,336
Pinkie Pie: OK. All we need is a
   dot of salt, a dab of sugar

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,937
     and a spritz of ginger.

3
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,907
Uh, are those real measurements?

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,775
How do you keep track
without a recipe?

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,111
              Pie baking is more
               art than science.

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,547
                And this will be
                 my masterpiece!

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,083
       It's to celebrate Rainbow
         Dash's seventy-third

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,052
    Wonderbolt training session!

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,888
         Seventy-third?
        That's specific.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,789
             I know!

11
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,625
  The pie is blueberry because
  Wonderbolt outfits are blue.

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,961
      The crust is rainbow,
      for obvious reasons.

13
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,964
  But the most special part is
 the seventy-three super-secret

14
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,767
sweets and spices that represent
     each training session!

15
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,505
 Could you please pass the brown
 sugar, pink sugar, sweet-root,

16
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,073
          apple-jelly,
     berry-mash and a towel?

17
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,114
 You sure are going to a lot of
 trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie.

18
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,650
   Phew! That's because I know
    how much she loves them.

19
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,420
    My pies are her favorite!

20
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:57,889
       It's worth all the
    trouble to see her happy.

21
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,725
   Now I'm going to need some
   cocoa powder, cocoa flakes...

22
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,126
         Ooh! Cocoa bar!

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,162
           Want some?

24
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,664
     Isn't that for the pie?

25
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:08,767
           [laugh] Oh, Twilight!
             That's hilarious!

26
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,437
     You don't mix chocolate
      into a blueberry pie!

27
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,872
     This is my mid-morning,
 pie-making chocolate fuel that

28
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,975
   keeps this pie baking train
    chugging down the tracks!

29
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,415
       Break time's over!

30
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,250
   Now let's finish this pie!

31
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,852
          Chugga-chugga
    chugga-chugga CHOO-CHOO!

32
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,332
Good training,
everypony.

33
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:14,532
Nice work, Crash.

34
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,635
You really added that sparkle
to that pressure-diamond-drop.

35
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,439
            SURPRISE!

36
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,642
       Happy seventy-third
  Wonderbolt training session!

37
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,312
               My seventy-third
               training session?

38
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,513
                That's specific.

39
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,583
      I know! I'm just so
    proud and happy for you

40
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,083
       and I've been counting
       all your training sessions,

41
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,487
and I was going to wait until your
100th, but I got too excited

42
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,922
and I know how
much you love pie,

43
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,059
so HAPPY SEVENTY-THIRD
TRAINING SESSION!

44
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,229
                WHAA? You didn't
                have to do this.

45
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:47,132
I know I didn't have to,
but I really wanted to!

46
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:49,569
Have a bite.

47
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,136
              Whoa! What's that?

48
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,373
                   Huh. Guess it
                   was nothing.

49
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:57,976
          But wow, this pie is
         the best I've ever had!

50
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,013
               Is that.. cinnamon?

51
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,982
I knew you'd love it!

52
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:05,651
Have more. I made the
whole thing for you.

53
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,720
        Really? That's so great!

54
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,990
        But I need to go change.

55
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,459
            And then I have to
           take Tank to the vet.

56
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,562
      His sensitive tortoise
   tummy's been acting up again.

57
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,664
           Do you mind if I take
             this pie with me?

58
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,165
Of course not!

59
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,701
I gotta get back to my shift
at Sugarcube Corner anyway.

60
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,603
Congratulations again!

61
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,038
          Heh, thanks.

62
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,477
      [happy sigh]
    I knew she'd love it.

63
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,218
           Is that...

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,519
           Is that...?

65
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,656
              STOP!

66
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,795
   You didn't see a blueberry
     rainbow crust

67
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,030
  seventy-three ingredient pie

68
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:53,766
    with a slice eaten out of
      it in here, did you?

69
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,435
             Uh, n-no?

70
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,470
  Right. Of course you didn't.

71
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,340
That would be ridiculous because
   I made it for Rainbow Dash

72
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,175
     and she loves my pies.

73
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,611
   She would never throw them
 away like trash, in the trash,

74
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:06,945
    with other trash, right?

75
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,013
             RIGHT?

76
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,248
                   Um, right...?

77
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,320
       Hmm. That pie couldn't have
      been the one I made,

78
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,122
    I must be seeing things.

79
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,190
       I did have a lot of
     chocolate this morning.

80
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,128
      But what if I wasn't
         seeing things?

81
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,063
    What if that was my pie?

82
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,098
     Heh. That would be bananas!

83
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,773
   Unless... Rainbow Dash's been
     replaced by an imposter

84
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,008
      who throws delicious
           pies away!

85
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:43,148
   Or has she been brainwashed
   by a pie-hating evil queen?

86
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,752
     You make a good point.

87
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,288
       Rainbow Dash is too
   stubborn to be brainwashed.

88
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,657
     Plus she hates washing.

89
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:54,627
     Hmmm. There's something
       else going on here.

90
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,697
 Let's look up a few of the more
 recent pies I've made for her.

91
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,567
      The boysenberry pie I
    made for her birthday...

92
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,036
   and her three half-birthday
       lemon meringues...

93
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,471
 and the It's Not Your Birthday
   But Here's A Pie Anyway Day

94
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,540
          custard pie!

95
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:10,877
  She ate all of these, right?

96
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,846
   [gasp] Another pie!?

97
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,648
Thank you so much!

98
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,952
 Whoa, what's that?

99
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:21,453
 [chewing] Guess it was nothing.

100
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,254
Heh heh.

101
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,056
     Awesome!

102
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,458
     Three lemon meringues?

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,459
  Uh.. hey, what's that over there?

104
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,365
         [chews] Oh, never mind. Heh.

105
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,568
Great pies!

106
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,905
    Happy It's Not Your Birthday
     But Here's Pie Anyway Day!

107
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,272
      Thank you!

108
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,907
No way, check that out!

109
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,280
   A-ha! It's not even my birthday!

110
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,750
Oh, sorry, guess
it was nothing.

111
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,851
[slurp] Mm.

112
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,720
But that custard
 was everything!

113
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:01,093
 Have I ever really seen Rainbow
    Dash eat one of my pies?

114
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,896
    And do I always look when
   somepony points behind me?

115
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:05,598
          WHAT'S THERE?

116
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,599
            Heh. Good one.

117
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,401
       But I need answers!

118
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,372
  I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie

119
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,073
        every month she's
        been a Wonderbolt

120
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,277
  and you're telling me you've
     never seen her eat one?

121
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,747
         Er...... Affirmative!

122
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,116
        Or uh, negative.

123
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,419
       Um.. I-I-I mean, she wasn't
        seen eating one.

124
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,788
Hmm... interesting.

125
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,491
Very interesting....

126
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,826
   Are we under investigation?

127
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,062
       As chief detective
        on the pie case,

128
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,431
      I've labeled you all
       ponies-of-interest

129
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,335
      so it's best you tell
     me everything you know.

130
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,303
       Well, we have been
       getting mysterious

131
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,772
     monthly pie donations.

132
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,275
    Would you be able to pick
  these pies out of a line up?

133
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,881
           I hear Rainbow Dash's
            pet tortoise, Tank,

134
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,882
                 has been having
                 tummy troubles.

135
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,284
              When did it start?

136
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,919
        About a week ago.

137
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:04,389
 Poor Tank had all the telltale
    signs of sugar overload:

138
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,991
  jittery shell, sleeplessness,
     reptilian indigestion.

139
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,327
             Hmm...

140
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,462
  and this all happened the day
   after I made Rainbow Dash a

141
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,165
  "thanks-for-lending-me-your-
       jacket" peach pie.

142
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,135
   It seems the pieces of the
 puzzle are plopping into place,

143
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,304
  but the picture isn't pretty.

144
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,107
         [gasp] Note to self: P
        alliteration pie.

145
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,075
   Is that everything, Doctor?

146
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,910
    Well, there's also this.

147
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,547
          Interesting.

148
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,683
  Did you have the lab analyze
     the flavor of that pie?

149
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:36,255
 No, but you know, Ms. Cheerilee
    was in here not long ago.

150
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,091
      The class hamster was
    having similar symptoms.

151
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,760
  [gasp] Perhaps it's a pie pandemic!

152
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:42,828
            Perhaps.

153
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,264
      And I just might know
       pony patient zero!

154
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,200
       Dr. Fauna's right.

155
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,603
   I do always have to remind
      the foals and fillies

156
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,638
   not to share the pies with
       the class hamster.

157
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,408
       Animals just can't
        digest pony food.

158
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,442
Indeed.

159
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,778
But where do these
pies come from?

160
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,546
              Well, they're from
                 Rainbow Dash!

161
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,281
               She drops off her
              "Day-after-Rainbow

162
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,417
           Dash's-half-birthday"
              pie every year.

163
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,353
       Did you say the day
    after her half birthday!?

164
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,122
     Very, very interesting.

165
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,793
   Because I give her a pie on
  her half birthday every year!

166
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,063
      And I have a feeling
       it's the same pie.

167
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,800
  Well, wherever it comes from,
   the students just love it.

168
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,302
I'm so glad.

169
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,272
        At least I can be
        sure somepony is.

170
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,611
  She didn't eat the blueberry,
   she didn't eat the banana,

171
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,013
  she didn't eat the cream and
  she didn't eat the chocolate.

172
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,815
   SHE DIDN'T EAT ANY OF 'EM.

173
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,217
              WHY?

174
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,486
     And don't tell me this
   all just started recently;

175
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,955
  it's been going on for years!

176
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,657
   Cheerilee said so herself.

177
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,961
And if there's one thing I know,
   you can't escape the truth!

178
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,239
 Rainbow Dash doesn't like PIE!

179
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,975
   AND SHE'S BEEN LYING TO ME
    ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME!

180
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,113
           AAAAHHHHH!

181
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,286
           AAAAHHHHH!

182
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,321
           Pinkie Pie?

183
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:17,956
           Pinkie Pie?

184
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,393
              Whoa!

185
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,864
       Oh. Party Planning
          Cave. Right.

186
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,233
             You OK?

187
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,168
Or are you just
screamin' for fun?

188
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,804
               Screaming is fun,
                but I'm not OK!

189
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,173
    I've been making Rainbow
      Dash pies for years,

190
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,441
         but she doesn't
         even like them!

191
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,610
     She's been lying to me!

192
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,979
 But everypony loves your pies!

193
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,582
   They're the greatest thing
      since sliced apples.

194
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:44,352
          Thank you!

195
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:47,153
And I could swear I've seen her
eat one of your pies before.

196
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,588
                Have you REALLY?

197
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,926
      Um, I thought I had;
      that's why I said it?

198
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,062
                   Are you suuure?

199
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,665
Maybe I haven't?

200
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,066
            Exactly!

201
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,801
  Because it's all been a sham.

202
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,937
 Rainbow Dash has been laughing
    at my pies behind my back

203
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,873
  and scheming of a way to get
     rid of them for years!

204
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,982
  Bring forth the worst tasting
    food in all of Equestria!

205
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:25,323
  And now I will destroy Pinkie
   Pie's horrid abominations,

206
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:30,161
    freeing the land of these
    disgusting pies FOREVER!

207
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,463
               Nooooooo!

208
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:38,136
    Good riddance strawberry
  cream and peaches 'o plenty!

209
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,272
      Be gone apple crumble
       and lemon surprise!

210
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,311
        Gone! Gone! GONE!

211
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,917
I really don't think
that's what's happening.

212
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,485
                   I don't think
                    so either.

213
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,922
           I know so.

214
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,024
Well, I've got just the
thing to get your mind off

215
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,292
all this madness.

216
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,093
 We've had a great apple harvest

217
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,130
so I was hoping you could whip
up a few of your delicious pies.

218
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:10,002
        Yes, I will make
       pies, lots of pies!

219
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,671
    I'm going to make Rainbow
       Dash so many pies,

220
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,406
       it'll force her to
        admit the truth,

221
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,376
    or I'll catch her in the
   act of getting rid of them.

222
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,245
 Operation: Pie of Lies is a go.

223
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,545
       Thanks, Applejack.

224
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,082
     I knew I could count on
   you to come up with a plan.

225
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,851
I don't think
that's what I did.

226
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,554
Also...how do you
get out of here?

227
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:32,724
            SURPRISE!

228
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,559
      Ah! What's happening?

229
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,062
    Happy unofficial
wake-your-friends-up day!

230
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,099
          Uh. I've never heard of
       wake-your-friends-up day.

231
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,501
Well, it's unofficial.

232
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,903
       But I made you your
  favorite pie in celebration!

233
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:45,971
             Ta-dah!

234
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,706
      Gifts are the second
     most important part of

235
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:48,740
    wake-your-friends-up day!

236
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,042
              W-What's the first
            most important part?

237
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,578
Accepting the gifts and
enjoying them immediately.

238
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,014
              Uh...

239
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:58,284
 Well, I'm sorry I forgot about
    wake-your-friends-up day.

240
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,986
    Let me make it up to you.

241
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:02,221
              Here!

242
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,490
             Achoo!

243
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:13,899
             Achoo!

244
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,734
    The pie... where'd it go?

245
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,636
        What do you mean
        where did it go?

246
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,739
          Ha ha. Mm mm.

247
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,641
        How!? Where!? When!?

248
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,349
       Congratulations on
       your seventy-fourth

249
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,717
           Wonderbolt
        training session!

250
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:33,785
          Here's a pie.

251
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:34,721
           Now eat it!

252
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:38,824
OK, this is getting
a little out of hoof.

253
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,159
I haven't even
trained yet.

254
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,761
         Well, I wanted
        to pre-celebrate

255
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,063
   because I already know how
     great you're gonna do.

256
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,265
          Eat the pie!

257
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,534
        Pinkie, look out!

258
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,304
 I'm not going to fall for-- AH!

259
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,139
              Whoa!

260
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,047
       Pinkie! Are you OK!?

261
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,649
          [struggling] Get me down!

262
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,018
 Sorry Ma'am but we have to make
     sure you didn't sustain

263
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,488
     any internal injuries.

264
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,857
        But the pie, what
      happened to the pie?

265
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,160
Oh.. The pie was delicious.
You just get better!

266
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,763
             NOOOOO!

267
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,469
Ah! Somepony help me!

268
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,606
Rainbow Dash, thank
goodness you're here!

269
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,842
   I was trying to fix the top
   pie on my pie pyramid

270
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,911
       but the whole thing
        became unstable.

271
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:38,683
And there's only one way to save
  me: you have to eat the pies!

272
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,651
     Don't worry, I got ya!

273
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,222
           Oh, right.

274
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,791
 Or you could save me that way.

275
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,593
You gotta be more
careful, OK?

276
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,263
             Grrrr!

277
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:58,637
          Rainbow Dash!

278
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,506
    I wanted to thank you for
 saving me from the pie pyramid,

279
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,041
         so have a pie.

280
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,142
           Have three!

281
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,310
          Have fifteen!

282
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,313
 I<i> know</i> how much you love them!

283
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,215
           Now eat up!

284
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,249
              Uh...

285
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,218
             Thanks!

286
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,589
         I can't wait to
       eat ALL THESE PIES!

287
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,529
     What? Where did they--
          How did you--

288
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,431
           Delicious!

289
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,366
    You did it again, Pinkie.

290
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,108
  Rainbow Dash, there you are!

291
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,343
   I made a pie for everypony

292
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,245
   and you're the only one who
     hasn't eaten hers yet.

293
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,247
       So here. Your pie.

294
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,849
      For you to eat. Now!

295
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,051
   Are you OK?

296
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,920
     You seem to be staring
        more than usual.

297
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,590
   I just REALLY like to watch
      others enjoy my pies.

298
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,030
       You sure you don't
         have to blink?

299
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,467
        Me? Nope, I'm not
       much of a blinker.

300
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,738
      Don't mind me, go
     ahead and take a bite.

301
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,144
    Well..... do I want to take a
    big bite or a small bite?

302
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,714
       I just don't know.

303
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,516
        Or maybe medium.

304
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:21,252
          No, no, no.
          Definitely NOT medium.

305
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,522
         Just try some!

306
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,146
Ahhh..

307
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:31,862
      Ah...  Do you have any.... milk?

308
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:49,948
Ah, never mind.

309
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,018
Your pies are just
too good to resist.

310
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,319
             What?
              No!

311
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,186
              NO!

312
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,655
           That's it!

313
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,590
        I can't take it!

314
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,825
     Uh. Everything OK, Pinkie?

315
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,628
    No, everything is NOT OK!

316
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,030
        YOU HATE MY PIES!

317
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,935
 What are you
talking about?

318
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,270
           You know exactly what
            I'm talking about!

319
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,438
             I saw what you did.

320
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,673
                Well, I didn't
               SEE what you did,

321
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,575
        but I know that you've
       been fake eating my pies!

322
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,410
    You threw away the pie I
   made for your seventy-third

323
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,012
 Wonderbolt training session and
 I know you SECRETLY somehow got

324
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,581
      rid of all the other
        pies I gave you!

325
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:23,782
            ADMIT IT!

326
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,117
          That's crazy!

327
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,318
    What do you think I did,

328
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,388
      somehow make them all
    disappear into thin air?

329
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,092
            Heh heh.

330
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:38,596
   OK, so maybe I made one of
  them disappear into thin air.

331
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,837
                  HOW COULD YOU?

332
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,709
      What!? I, um, I-I just wanted to
    share these amazing pies

333
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,344
  with the folks of Cloudsdale.

334
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:57,582
  So I uh, I was trying to send
    them up via balloon mail.

335
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,451
        But you just said
      they were delicious.

336
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,253
         Well, obviously
        that's because...

337
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,122
         I have amnesia!

338
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,624
     I've been brainwashed!

339
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,161
It's.... opposite day?

340
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,230
      Your memory's working
     fine, you hate washing

341
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,665
       and I know today's
        not Opposite Day

342
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,567
      because I bake you a
     pie for it every year.

343
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,702
     A pie that you probably
        just throw away.

344
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,003
       Or give to charity.

345
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:22,440
   Or destroy with your laser
   eyes while laughing at me!

346
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,209
           Laser eyes?

347
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,478
        Oh, oh! So you admit it.

348
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,648
What? No! I can explain.

349
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,316
    I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!

350
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,560
   She won't listen to me; she
     won't let me apologize.

351
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,863
        [sigh] I feel terrible.

352
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,231
         Well, you have
       been lying to her.

353
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,067
     To all of us, actually.

354
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,870
  Yeah, is there anything else
    you're lying about

355
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,205
      that we should know?

356
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,106
               No!

357
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,844
   Well, not that I can think
   of off the top of my head.

358
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,780
       Is it MY fault that
       I don't like pies?

359
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,984
      And not just Pinkie's
         pies, all pies.

360
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,486
       I know how much she
        loves making pies

361
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,956
 and if I told her I didn't like
them, it would have crushed her.

362
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,093
          Uh. You kinda
       crushed her anyway.

363
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,197
    Oh- But I- You're right.

364
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,801
I guess I should've just eaten
the pies in the first place.

365
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,336
[gasp] Wait, that's it!

366
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,705
I know how I can
make it up to her!

367
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:35,145
                  Pee-yew! Gummy
                   is that you?

368
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,448
       Huh. What is that?

369
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,185
         Oh, it's<i> you</i>.

370
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,621
        Pinkie Pie, wait.

371
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,591
I know now that I should've been
 honest with you from the start

372
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,827
      because lying to your
        friends is wrong.

373
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,497
 And because getting rid of all
 those pies was a giant hassle.

374
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,032
     I mean, do you have any
       idea how many pies

375
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,667
       you've made for me
         over the years?

376
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,170
  Yes, I know exactly how many.

377
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,340
     I have a very detailed
        pie-ling system.

378
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,308
        Of course you do.

379
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,211
     The point is, I thought
     the hassle was worth it

380
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,948
  just to spare your feelings,
    but I was wrong.

381
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,151
     So to make up for it, I
     made this pie for you.

382
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,955
 Well, I guess I made it for me.

383
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,090
     To eat in front of you.

384
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:23,027
      Point is, I'm eating
    this pie for friendship!

385
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,765
   Wait, that smelly circular
    monstrosity is a pie?

386
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:28,567
              Yeah!

387
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,336
 I know I can't go back and eat
  all the pies you made for me

388
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,504
     in the past, so instead

389
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,940
      I'm going to eat this
     giant one for you now.

390
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,477
          So.. here I go!

391
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:43,949
Ahh......

392
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,983
Wait! I can't watch you do this.

393
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,490
    I mean, is that crust or
     some kind of concrete?

394
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,725
 Yeah, honestly, I have no idea.

395
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,460
       Oh, I can't believe
      you're willing to eat

396
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,062
    this terrible pie for me.

397
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,766
 It's ridiculous and this whole
   thing is overly complicated and...

398
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,870
     [sigh] I think I finally
    understand why you lied.

399
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,805
       Whoa, what's that?

400
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,042
   Huh. Guess it was nothing.

401
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,744
 I'm so glad you enjoy my pies!

402
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,482
 Oh, never mind.

403
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,951
     Great pies!

404
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,719
                      EEEEEE!

405
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,721
     No way, check that out!

406
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,959
      A-ha! It's not even my birthday!

407
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,996
Oh, sorry, guess it was nothing.

408
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,999
Mm. But that custard was everything!

409
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,135
  Seeing you eat my pies makes
    me the happiest pony

410
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,772
      in all of Equestria!

411
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:43,175
        Heh. I know it does.

412
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,745
 You did a lot of ridiculous and
overly complex things to get rid

413
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,516
   of my pies because it made
   you happy to see me happy.

414
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:54,385
  Just like I went to a lot of
   effort to make you the pies

415
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,555
       because it made me
     happy to see you happy.

416
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:58,723
                      Yes!

417
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,092
    And if you're willing to
     go through all of that,

418
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:05,130
 it really shows how much you're
 willing to do for your friends.

419
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:08,366
   Heh. Aw shucks, it was nothing.

420
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,235
       Now get out of that
    thing and give me a hug!

421
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:17,375
Just remember, in the future you
  can always be honest with me.

422
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,710
    Uh. I could've told her that.

423
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,713
              Cool...

424
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:26,884
      How 'bout this: Your
       hugs are too tight. Heh heh.

425
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,152
          Ha ha ha ha!

426
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:28,953
            Ha ha ha!

427
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:30,189
       No they're not.
