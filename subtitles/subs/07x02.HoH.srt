[whoosh]

347
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,508
You are?

348
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,040
[sigh] I'm really...
mad at you.

349
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,764
You lost Twilight's
map table;

350
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,612
you make jokes like
it's no big deal.

351
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:17,616
It's like you
don't even care

352
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,504
you could get me in
a lot of trouble.

353
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,016
If we can't find
that table,

354
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:23,132
Twilight's never going
to trust me again.

355
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:24,548
And the worst part is

356
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,968
you didn't even
say you were sorry!

357
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:32,272
I... I'm sorry. I had no
idea you felt that way.

358
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:34,156
Yeah. I do.

359
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,724
[poof]

360
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,976
But to be fair, I don't know
how you could have known.

361
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:41,788
I did a spell. I
bottled up my anger,

362
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:45,272
but when the bottle broke,
it infected these three.

363
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:50,936
I'm really sorry; I used magic
so I wouldn't use magic.

364
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:53,284
I should have guessed
that would backfire.

365
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:56,824
Oh, that's all right.
It was a slow day.

366
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:00,260
Yeah. I was gonna get
my dentures cleaned

367
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:02,008
before y'all showed up.

368
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,824
Oh, no. My nut cart!

369
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:06,428
[smash]

370
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,380
♪♪

371
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:11,288
Yay! My nut cart!

372
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,232
Hang on; don't you
work at the spa?

373
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:20,076
I'm late for my other job!
What, I wear many hats.

374
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,788
Not gonna lie, hearing you
and those random ponies

375
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:29,840
say all those terrible
things about me wasn't easy.

376
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,400
But I needed to hear it.

377
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,064
Why didn't you just
tell me how you felt?

378
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,420
I didn't want to
lose you as a friend.

379
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:41,028
Pfft. Come on! It'd take a lot
more than that to lose me.

380
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:44,368
Our friendship is stronger
than a few angry words.

381
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,532
And a magical
temper tantrum?

382
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:49,636
Listen, I'd take that
over the boring pony

383
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,336
you were becoming any day.

384
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:56,156
The Starlight I love is
passionate, lively and yeah,

385
00:19:56,212 --> 00:20:00,000
sometimes angry. Those are
my favorite parts of you.

386
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:03,944
That and the fact that you
forgive me every time.

387
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:05,484
[giggle]

388
00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:08,092
I'll forgive you
if you forgive me.

389
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,192
Deal.

390
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:12,036
I remember what I
was thinking about!

391
00:20:13,008 --> 00:20:13,940
[door jingles]

392
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,196
You're kidding me.

393
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
There's more to
it than that.

394
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:21,204
I was thinking about how
glad I am to have met you

395
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:22,772
and I remembered
our first meeting:

396
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,456
here at the Ponyville Spa.

397
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:28,008
And now I just have
to teleport it back.

398
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:29,396
No no no no noooo!

399
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:29,952
[crash]

400
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:38,260
A little to the left.
Now rotate it just a hair.

401
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:39,876
Hey, girls!
How'd it go?

402
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:41,716
[crash]

403
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,628
Nothing.

404
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:43,720
What?

405
00:20:44,424 --> 00:20:46,648
Let's just say I learned
a friendship lesson

406
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:47,532
while you were gone.

407
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:49,124
You've barely graduated

408
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:53,340
and you're already taking
initiative! Oh. So proud.

409
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:57,676
We learned about team building
and problem solving--

410
00:20:58,072 --> 00:20:59,752
--and when not to sing songs!

411
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,776
We certainly had
a good time,

412
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,724
but I really was looking
forward to a spa day.

413
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:09,144
And the Ponyville spa
is still open. Anyone?

414
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:11,132
Twilight: Sounds good to me!
Applejack: I reckon I could use that.
Rainbow Dash: I have a coupon!

415
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,864
We'll meet you there!

416
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,408
Quick. Do you have a spell
that will make the Spa Ponies

417
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:19,232
forget that the map
table was there?

418
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:20,792
Haven't you learned anything

419
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,228
about using magic to
solve your problems?

420
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:28,396
No. If we learn that lesson,
how will we ever have fun?

421
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:33,148
