I'm a level 30 enchanter with

Sir McBiggun, a level 27

himself with the Squizard,

Sir McBiggun would not
besmirch his honor.

I already have the best
name in the universe.

190

something like Captain Wuzz?

the other options, so fine.

We find ourselves
trapped in the dungeon

of the evil Squizard. The
bars are locked tight.

208
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:20,903
The bars exist...

209

...in our imagination.

210
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:29,129

this infernal evening?

Oh ha ha, oh you

Well, you can do
whatever you want.

216
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,094

this game is stupid.

[sigh]

351
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,138
Ahem.

352
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:06,997
We find ourselves in the
dungeon of the evil Squizard.

353
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:10,480
The bars are locked,
and oh who am I kidding?

354
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,324
We should give him
another chance.

355
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:17,369
[Ahem] Captain Wuzz?
Can you hear me?!

356
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:20,983
Oh, you realized
how amazing I am

357
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,967
and that I make you cooler
just by being around me?

358
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:30,207
Uh no, no, actually that's
not what I meant to say.

359
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:35,261
[mumble mumble]

360
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:36,785
What...?

361
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,748
I'm... [mumble....mumble].

362
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:41,920
We can't hear you.

363
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:42,484
Nnope.

364
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,510
I'm trying to say
I'm sorry, all right?

365
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,341
I'm sorry for
ruining your game,

366
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:49,510
and I'm sorry that I thought
I was better than you.

367
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:53,294
Now let's play before this
evening gets any sappier,

368
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,056
shall we?

369
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:58,508
Eeyup. [Whisper]

370
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:01,025
Huh? Yeah, yeah OK!

371
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:03,943
What if we forgot the board
and the pieces for a minute?

372
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:06,757
I mean, the whole
"game coming to life"

373
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,230
was completely terrifying,

374
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,357
but also kinda the
best thing ever.

375
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:13,529
So, uh Big Mac and
I were wondering...

376
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,602
what if you toned it
down just a teensy bit?

377
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:25,934
[chattering]

378
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:26,941
Huh?

379
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:33,392
[war cries]

380
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:35,877
I've got your
back, Captain Wuzz!

381
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:40,644
[clashing metal]

382
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:42,865
[panting]

383
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:47,595
[evil laughter]

384
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,023
Garbunkle, follow my lead!

385
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,557
Bullseye!

386
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,421
Nice one!

387
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,722
It's Guys' Night / aww yeah
/ havin' fun now / aww yeah.

388
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,444
We should just close the
door and let them finish...

389
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,232
whatever this is.

390
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:14,282
No way! Did you see Big Mac's
sword! I totally want in!

391
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,654
Yeah, I don't know
what it is,

392
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,115
but it looks like
super-duper fun!

393
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,298
GUYS' NIGHT!
