142
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,736
   Look, Rainbow Dash, I know
   this is important to you

143
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,738
     and we all want the
     routine to be special,

144
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,675
    but are you sure it needs
    to be this complicated?

145
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,878
      Of course! And I know
      we can pull it off.

146
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,514
    Sorry, Twilight. I
    don't have time to talk.

147
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,717
  We've got a LOT more work
  to do before the coronation.

148
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,590
    Darling, change is an
    integral part of fashion.

149
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,925
     I myself am considering
     opening boutiques

150
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,760
         for non-ponies.

151
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:13,064
  Things must evolve or they
  become <i>stale</i>. For example...

152
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,569
     I was just struck with
     a sudden inspiration

153
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,404
       to change my design
       for your gown

154
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,073
      by including the webs
     of these star spiders.

155
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,409
    They glow for a short
    while after they're spun.

156
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,311
     They won't have much
     time to weave the sash,

157
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,214
   but the effect will be
   dazzling. You see, darling?

158
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,583
     Change can be fabulous
     if you embrace it!

159
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,723
      Starlight is supposed
      to come over soon.

160
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,358
   There's a little something
   we wanted to give you

161
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,359
        before we leave.

162
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,831
     You know what? I think
     you're right, Twilight.

163
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,999
      I SHOULD take my
      comics to Canterlot.

164
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,935
      We can't leave the
      Power Ponies behind.

165
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,470
     I don't think the Power
     Ponies care, Spike.

166
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,105
        Just like all of
        our friends.

167
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,442
      All right, Twilight.
      Are you ready?

168
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,345
  We all wanted to see you off,
 but there's still a lot to do.

169
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,047
               Aren't <i>you</i> coming
               on the train?

170
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,050
  I gotta go with Big Mac so we
  can go over our packing list

171
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,419
      or we won't know who
      gets what deliveries.

172
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,787
              And I'm gonna meet
              the Wonderbolts

173
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,590
          so we can go over the
          routine one last time.

174
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,758
I'm going with Gummy.
He SAID he knows

175
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,160
when the fireworks
display should start,

176
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,496
but does anypony
really believe that!?

177
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,165
   And I still need to pick up
  food for the swans and doves

178
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,068
  who flew ahead to Canterlot.
  If I don't get them fed,

179
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,304
       they'll be too
       pooped to perform.

180
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,006
      Well, I'll be living
       in Canterlot alone..

181
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,041
      Might as well take
      the train alone too...!

182
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,211
          Bye! I guess..

183
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,648
     Oh, you won't be
    traveling alone, darling!

184
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,083
      I'll have just enough
      time on the train

185
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,151
    to weave the star spider
    sash for your gown!

186
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,888
    But we should leave now.
    There's no time to dawdle

187
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,756
    if you want the
    coronation to be perfect!

188
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,024
That's the problem!

189
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,627
  You're all so worried about
  making my coronation perfect,

190
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,330
   that I'm leaving Ponyville
   and none of you even CARE!

191
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,337
    Exactly. You moved away.

192
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,405
     Your friends didn't
     care and that was that.

193
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,542
     Actually, not exactly.

194
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,013
    Of course we care that
    you're moving, Twilight!

195
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,516
       I can't believe
       you think we don't..

196
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,818
      What could possibly
      make you think <i>that</i>!?

197
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,786
   I tried to talk to you all
    about how I was feeling,

198
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,655
   but you seemed more worried
   about what you had to do

199
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,723
       for the coronation!

200
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,358
     It's true. I was there.

201
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,694
   I suppose it gave us
   something else to focus on..

202
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,364
   I knew you were worried
   about everything changin'..

203
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,500
 I guess I thought if I made it
 seem like everything was OK,

204
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,835
          it would be..

205
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,970
      I was just trying to
      make you feel better.

206
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,773
      That way, <i>I</i> wouldn't
      feel so terrible.

207
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,575
Before I moved
to Ponyville,

208
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,343
I didn't really know
what friendship WAS.

209
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,011
        You've all taught
        me so much.

210
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,980
      I can't believe it
      all might be ending!

211
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,417
 But when I imagine the future,

212
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,586
   all I can think about is
   that we won't be together!

213
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,489
  I'm literally moving away
  from you and it's terrifying!

214
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,391
                I'm scared, too.

215
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,558
Me, too!

216
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,060
            Rattled to the core!

217
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,161
             Eeyup.

218
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,597
     I wouldn't say <i>scared</i>..

219
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:05,805
 But.. just because I <i>won't</i> say it
 doesn't mean I don't feel it..

220
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:09,274
      [sobbing] I'm going
      to miss you SO MUCH!

221
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,576
        I just can't stop
        thinking about

222
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,012
       how much things are
       going to change!

223
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,682
       What-what if we
      don't see each other!?

224
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,884
What if we don't
talk as much?

225
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,386
What if we don't
stay friends?

226
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:30,996
 I know it's weird, but knowing
 you're all are as upset as I am

227
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,998
 actually makes me less worried.

228
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,500
    That's nice, but you
    should be more worried...

229
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,502
       about missing the
       train to Canterlot!

230
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,239
 Sorry I'm so late! I actually
 thought I'd missed you-

231
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,574
     Spike: There's no time!

232
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:47,846
      Oh, no. We missed it!

233
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,215
          But maybe...

234
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,751
     OK. We're on the train.

235
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:54,439
        Everything should
         be fine, right?

236
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,056
     I'd worked out exactly
     how much time I needed

237
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,959
    to weave my star spider
    sash, and now I'm behind!

238
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,294
         I hope Big Mac
         can figure out

239
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,262
      who gets what
     deliveries on his own.

240

          Ah... Eeyup?

245
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,853
   I don't have the snacks the
    doves and swans will need

246

       their long flight!

247

  I'd better find the food car.

248

       And I need to meet

      when you didn't show,

251
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:45,804
  they thought you musta meant
  to meet outside of Canterlot.

      Maybe I would if you

311
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,578
     Oh heh, sorry. We're not

     That we aren't friends?

317
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,394
       That's not the
       point of my story.

     It's true my coronation

00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,938
Well, at least the
coronation is over!

320
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,150
       That was something!

321
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:53,752
       I was just about to
       say the same thing.

322
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:57,822
   I know maybe it wasn't the
   coronation you planned,

323
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,458

    Since you're moving away,

327
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,234
    we thought if you missed
    any of us, or Ponyville,

328
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,402
        this might help.

336
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,819
       But I don't want
       to only look back..

337
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,988
    Obviously, the coronation
       wasn't perfect,

338
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,189
    but that doesn't matter.

339
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,358
     It's our relationships
     that really count

340
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,193
  and we have to maintain them.

341
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,328
    But now that we're
   living in different places,

342
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,197
    I'm not exactly sure how..

343
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,000
       I am. I suggest we
       meet once a moon.

344
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,604
   In fact, my first royal
  decree as ruler of Equestria

345
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,972
     is to establish this
     Council of Friendship!

346
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,878
      Celestia: And what a
     wonderful decree it is!

347
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,347
  We always knew that whatever
  adversity you faced, you and

348
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,984
  your friends would find your
  way through it together.

349
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,287
   We know Equestria is in the
   perfect hooves with you

350
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,690
       AND your friends
       looking out for it.

351
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:07,692
     And while we'll always
     be here if you need us,

352
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,728
        it's time for us
        to be on our way.

353
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,696
         You're leaving..?

354
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,532
  We hope you'll come and
   visit us in Silver Shoals.

355
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,668
    But now it's time for
    you to rule on your own.

356
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,238
  You're all MORE than capable.

357
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,407
   Thank you. For everything.

358
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,182
       So, even though
       everything changed,

359
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,984
       and you moved away
       from your friends,

360
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,653
     you didn't grow apart?

361
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,422
     And <i>THIS</i> is the
     Council of Friendship.

362
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,324
       That's what you're
       all doing here?

363
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,027
   Duh. This time every moon!

364
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:47,032
 Heh. What she means is, this is how
 we've been ruling together!

365
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,134
     And how we've continued
      to face every problem

366
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,169
     and threat to Equestria
      over the years.

367
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,539
      But mostly, it's how
      we keep in touch.

368
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,074
  No matter how busy life gets!

369
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,443
      Sometimes friendships
       can be hard,

370
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,078
        and it takes work
        to maintain them,

371
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,681
   but without friends,
   things can be a lot harder.

372
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:04,449
         I never thought
        about friendship

373
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,386
    being something to work
    at.. and I don't mind work.

374
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,854
      I guess if they don't
      have to fade away,

375
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,192
  maybe making friends isn't
  the waste of time I thought!

376
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,394
     But.. I've been so
     focused on my studies,

377
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,363
         I wouldn't know
         where to start.

378
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:19,764
        That's all right,

379
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,833
     because I know exactly
     where to send you.
