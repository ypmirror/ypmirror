1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,237
      I don't know, folks.

2
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:08,674
       She's been in
       there a <i>long</i> time..

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,847
     Do you suppose the
    Terrifying Trunk Escape

4
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,582
      is too much for her?

5
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:20,252
 What if the Great and Powerful
     Trixie can't--

6
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,489
            Escape..?

7
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,360
      But if you're there,
      who's in here!?

8
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,562
      Why, our volunteer of course!

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,134
      Crab-apple surprise!

10
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,736
 You should oughta tell a pony
  before you go a-poofing 'em

11
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,238
        around a stage!

12
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:48,047
        Trixie, that was
        an amazing show!

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,949
  Flurry Heart and I loved it.

14
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,318
I'm so glad we decided to come.

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,653
 You two have a real chemistry.

16
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,355
         The Terrifying
         Trunk Escape

17
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,726
    does require a great and
      powerful assistant.

18
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,496
The way you two worked together,
 it's like you've known each

19
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,731
      other as long as
      Twilight and I have.

20
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,599
       It was pretty fun.

21
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,101
Of course, it was!

22
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,104
  There's nothing better than
   a bond with another pony.

23
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,006
       You can share all
       kinds of things.

24
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,142
     <i> ♪ Sunshine, sunshine,</i>
       <i> ladybugs awake. ♪</i>

25
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,145
    <i> ♪ Clap your hooves and</i>
     <i> do a little shake! ♪</i>

26
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:25,150
I think we'll stick to
the stage magic for now.

27
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,620
          The great and powerful
           Trixie doesn't chant.

28
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:10,395
       As much as I love
       my one-pony show,

29
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,297
      it's always nice to
       come to Ponyville

30
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,500
   and perform with my great
    and powerful assistant.

31
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,470
    Cadance is right! We
     do work well together.

32
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,840
Doing a show with you is almost
as much fun as counseling

33
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,475
students at Twilight's school--

34
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,777
   [gasp] -which I'm supposed
   to be doing right now!

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,713
         See ya later!

36
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,186
                    Excuse me,
                   Ms. Powerful?

37
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,123
    Heh heh! Usually ponies
     just call me Trixie,

38
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,726
but Ms. Powerful
has a nice ring!

39
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,396
  From here to Saddle Arabia,
  I have seen nothing

40
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,299
      that compares with
      your wondrous show.

41
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,335
  Would you consider blessing
   my homeland with it?

42
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:54,073
I<i> was</i> just about to
set out on tour... ugh..

43
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,909
but Saddle Arabia is much
 farther than my usual route--

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,147
            Heh heh.

45
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:05,417
--and uh, my caravan might not
be suited for an extended tour.

46
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,753
        Mine is new and
        quite spacious.

47
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,755
        If it would help
         persuade you,

48
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,424
     I would happily trade
     it for yours.

49
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,360
     Trade it? Heavens no!

50
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,996
  This is more than just some
   great and powerful wagon

51
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,331
      you see before you.

52
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,432
         It is shelter.

53
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,468
     It is transportation.

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,673
It is my only friend in the long
 and lonely nights on the road!

55
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:31,276
 Very well, then I must see as
  many of your performances

56
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,445
     as I can. If I
      cannot convince you

57
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,681
       to bring your tour
       to Saddle Arabia,

58
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,218
     I must be prepared to
    relate its magnificence

59
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,286
    to your many fans there.

60
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,655
      Many fans, you say?

61
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:48,226
    Well, I suppose I could
    consider the trip.

62
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:49,561
                  Wonderful!

63
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,797
          I look forward to
         seeing you on the road.

64
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,566
   And if you change your
    mind about the caravans,

65
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,101
     my offer remains open.

66
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,271
             Hmmm..

67
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,640
     It's just so far away!

68
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,043
   Of course, I love visiting
    new and exciting places,

69
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,814
    I am a<i> traveling</i>
      magician after all.

70
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,416
Hmm. Sounds like
your mind's made up.

71
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,669
           Not quite.

72
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,721
  The road is a lonely place,
  and this trip even more so.

73
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:21,727
I was hoping I might convince my
great and powerful assistant

74
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,095
         to come along.

75
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,396
            Really?

76
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,465
                   Of course!

77
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,933
  You're not just my assistant
   and my counselor,

78
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,568
     you're also my friend,

79
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,903
  and what's better
 than a road trip with friends?

80
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:32,938
   Nothing!

81
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,241
This will be the best
magical road trip ever!

82
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,281
I should probably get somepony
to cover my student counseling

83
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,582
    duties while we're gone..

84
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,955
   Trixie, are you all right?

85
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,358
  One caravan for two all set!

86
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,559
    Oh, you brought luggage.

87
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,263
Heh. I mean, of course
you brought luggage!

88
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,216
                  You bet I did.

89
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:02,768
 Everything two ponies need for
 the road trip of their lives!

90
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,705
Three one-thousand piece
puzzles, one copy of Dragon Pit,

91
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,907
     the best board game in
     the history of ponies,

92
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,645
my famous collection of campfire
spices and an inflatable raft.

93
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,713
    Did I forget something?

94
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,715
     I can pop back to the
      castle and grab it.

95
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,884
Oh, no. It isn't that...

96
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,288
      Yeah... Maybe we
      don't need the raft.

97
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,858
                 Ah! We just
                 needed a little

98
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,462
              great and powerful
             reorganization!

99
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:31,863
             Now... everything...

100
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,332
        Fits... Just...

101
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:34,900
             Fine!

102
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,236
     Ugh. Who am I kidding?

103
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,339
 My wagon is too small for us.

104
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,908
    I understand if you're
    having second thoughts.

105
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,309
        Second thoughts?

106
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,844
        Are you kidding?

107
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,014
       This wagon isn't
       small, it's.... cozy.

108
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,717
      And there's no such
      thing as too cozy!

109
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,852
        Well all right, then!

110
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,321
       I guess it's time
       to hit the road!

111
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,658
      I'll-- start us off...

112
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,368
    OK, maybe there is such
     a thing as too cozy.

113
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,509
          You're sure you
           wouldn't rather ride?

114
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,146
                  I'm sure.

115
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,549
  And you're not backing out?

116
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,251
The two of us sleeping in that
"cozy" caravan could get tricky.

117
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,653
     Trixie, there's plenty
     of high-quality inns

118
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,755
     to stay at on the way.

119
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,257
     Don't worry about it.

120
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,158
  I am<i> not</i> backing out of the
  greatest and most powerful

121
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,529
  road trip bonding experience
  two ponies could ever have!

122
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:41,199
Well, when you put it like that,
I'm actually kind of excited!

123
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,767
                 Me too. Ah!

124
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,936
    Thank goodness we're not
    Twilight or the others.

125
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,805
      They'd probably sing
        a song about it.

Wait, what did he say?

140
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,300

168
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:51,695
 I've learned the hard way that
 life on the road requires very

169
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,367
    specific supplies and we
    only have so many bits,

170
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,403
       so we'll have to

Heh. Sorry about wasting

00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,712
         Falafel Bonding, right?

174
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,182
            Besides, we still
              have enough for...

175
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,851
             haycakes and juice.

176

         we go there?

00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,024
         Oh, no no no.

178
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,126
        I always buy my
        haycakes here.

179
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,130
So, we're just going to wait
in line for hours...

180
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,033
uh.. which is totally cool!

181
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,535
Waiting In Line Bonding, right?

182
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:34,072
   After our falafel purchase,

183
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,541
     we weren't able to get
     everything on my list,

184
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,077
     but we are definitely
      set for breakfast.

185
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,346
And I'm sure we'll find
out that waiting in that

186
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,348
super long line
was worth it.

187
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,352
  A few hiccups always happen;
 we'll be back on the road

188
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,621
     to friendship after a
     good night's sleep.

189
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,289
                 We're all full!

190
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,426
I-I'm sure we'll find something.

191
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,461
             Nope.

192
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:57,963
             Sorry.

193
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,530
           All full.

194
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,502
   Ah, the Glowpaz Festival.

195
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,937
     Somnambula is no doubt
      filled to the brim.

196
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,774
 Luckily, travelers such as
  ourselves have our caravans.

197
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,494
                Heh heh.

198
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,845
   You said there'd be
   plenty of places to stay.

199
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,416
     "Don't even worry
      about it," you said.

200
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,618
     You might have thought
     to make a reservation.

201
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,188
Um... I've been with you
singing and standing in line.

202
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,723
When would I have done that?

203
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,060
 I don't know, but I'm starting
to think you aren't as great

204
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,397
     and powerful an
    assistant as I thought.

205
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,434
So, you just brought me
along to do your legwork!?

206
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,604
   [sigh] No. Of course not.

207
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,839
           I'm sorry.

208
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,540
      I'm just frustrated!

209
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,912
I was really looking forward to
a relaxing night in a nice room.

210
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:51,683
[sigh] Me too, but since there's
literally no room at the inns,

211
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,786
I guess it's lucky
we've got the wagon.

212
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,355
Sleeping In Tight
Quarters Bonding...

213
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,391
            Yaaaay.

214
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,599
  Is there something I can do

215
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,702
      to make things more
      <i>comfortable</i> for you?

216
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,138
You could get rid of this junk.

217
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,844
Yes, well, before we throw away
the magical items it's taken me

218
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:23,648
   years to collect, we could
    try switching hammocks.

219
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,449
         Fine!

220
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:34,351
          Ah!

221
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,262
        Starlight?

222
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,496
                 Starlight!

223
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,198
       I think there's a
      wild animal outside!

224
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,902
           Starlight!?

225
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,238
           STARLIGHT!

226
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,673
            Wha...? Huh?

227
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,507
             WHAT?

228
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,675
           I'm sorry.

229
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,777
    Your snoring is a bit...

230
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,212
              Loud? Heh heh.

231
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,680
        Yeah. I do that.

232
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,749
   I had my village convinced
   we were being attacked

233
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,250
     by bears every night. Heh.

234
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:04,556
          [ahem] But we probably need a
           better solution here.

235
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,662
   [sleepily] Ladies and gentleponies!

236
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:16,068
     The Great and Powerful
       Trixie will now...

237
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,836
           Seriously!?

238
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:19,978
         Prepare to be
          amazed....!

239
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,212
                     <i>Sleep </i>well?

240
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,013
           Sure did.

241
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,085
Is uh, that the last
of the hay cakes?

242
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,922
Oh. yeah. Sorry.

243
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:38,957
           It's fine.

244
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,493
I don't suppose
there's.. more juice?

245
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,798
                 [glug glug] Ah!

246
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,801
              I guess we'll have
                to re-supply.

247
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,671
What a glorious
morning!

248
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,476
   I can't tell you how much
   I am looking forward

249
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,345
       to the first show
         of your tour.

250
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,416
  Is he going to be following
   us for the whole time?

251
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,218
                  I do not know.

252
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,690
She's been in there a long time...

253
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,593
 Do you suppose the Terrifying
 Trunk Escape is too much for a

254
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:19,664
pony who drinks all the JUICE
and talks nonstop in her sleep!?

255
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,733
 What if the Great and <i>Powerful</i>
    Trixie can't--

256
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:27,939
   <i>Sleep</i> because her roommate
   snores like an Ursa Major?

257
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,143
But if you're there,
who's in here?

258
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,818
        There's not much
         room in here.

259
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,420
At least you don't have to
sleep in it with another PONY!

260
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,127
This show was much
better in Ponyville..

261
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,432
              Oh! Would <i>you</i> like
               the last carrot?

262
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:58,303
      I know how fond you are of
      eating the last of things.

263
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,272
    Oh, no. It might
    make me thirsty

264
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,942
     and we don't have
    anything to drink, so...

265
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:11,049
    The good news is I'm so
    exhausted I could sleep

266
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,818
       through a stampede
         of WILD boars,

267
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,486
        which you'll be
       delighted to know

268
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,089
    is only slightly louder
    than your snoring.

269
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,058
Well,<i> I'm</i> looking forward
to rehearsing the act

270
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,112
with you all night.

271
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:27,065
 So diligent of you to go over
 it and over it in your sleep.

272
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,867
    Practice makes perfect.

273
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,435
Not today, it didn't.

274
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:34,172
            Well, I'm sorry
            you're so miserable!

275
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,442
Really!? Because if you wanted to
make things more comfortable,

276
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,377
you could always
pare down a bit!

277
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,350
     Well, since you're <i>so</i>
     concerned about space,

278
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,185
      you can have it all!

279
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,088
I'll sleep under the stars where
 at least the wild animals

280
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,257
   will be QUIETER THAN YOU!

281
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,131
I do not mean to interrupt, but
 it seems there is trouble

282
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,433
   on the road to friendship.

283
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,402
     Ha ha ha ha. <i>Ya think?</i>

284
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,178
       WHERE'S MY WAGON!?

285
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,415
I traded it to that pony
from Saddle Arabia for his!

286
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,951
He even threw in
a pair of robes!

287
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,819
       ♪ [horror sting] ♪

288
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,858
                    YOU WHAT?

289
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,095
I traded the old, worn-out wagon
that was too small for us

290
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,499
  for this nice, new, spacious
  one that we can both enjoy.

291
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:38,203
   BUT [spluttering] WHO SAID
   YOU COULD DO THAT?

292
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,204
     Nopony. I just did it.

293
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,708
       Ah! Now we both have
       plenty of room

294
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,177
    and you didn't even have
    to give anything away.

295
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,747
         <i> Au contraire!</i>

296
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,883
   I DID give something away!

297
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,786
I gave away my wagon,
and my best friend.

298
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,924
Oh, I'm sorry!

299
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,226
I didn't realize you
were better friends

300
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,996
with that beat-up old wagon
than you are with <i>me</i>.

301
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,766
  Well, it's easy when the
   wagon is a better friend.

302
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,402
      <i> It</i> would have NEVER
      traded<i> you</i> away!

303
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,871
       That's ridiculous.

304
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,939
           Oh, it<i> is</i> ridiculous.

305
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,809
             In fact, this whole
             tour is ridiculous.

306
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:21,045
I don't even know why I
invited you in the first place!

307
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,282
Well! Maybe I should
just head home!

308
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,551
                I think that's a
                 very good idea.

309
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,455
And you can take this horrible,
 giant caravan WITH YOU!

310
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,389
         Fine!

311
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,256
                    Good!

312
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,611
    Goodness! Ms. Powerful.

313
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,547
         But where is
        your assistant?

314
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,249
   I had hoped providing you
  with a more comfortable

315
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,219
   means of conveyance would
   allow you to once more

316
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,622
  dazzle the crowds with
   mystifying feats of magic!

317
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,725
    Normally, that sort of
    flattery would suffice,

318
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:12,029
 but today we must discuss your
dishonest and unfair procurement

319
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,398
          of my wagon!

320
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,200
    I desired your wagon and
   provided one of equal

321
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,169
   or better value in return.

322
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,272
  It seems like a perfectly
  honest and fair trade to me.

323
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:25,076
   Unfortunately, it is
    more nuanced than that!

324
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,346
    I'm sure it is, but I
     am eager to set out.

325
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,714
      If you'll excuse me.

326
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,926
I am willing to wait
as long as you are.

327
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,095
Hah! We'll just see about that!

328
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,974
You know, even if I was
willing to reverse the trade,

329
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,776
you don't have my caravan
to offer in return.

330
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,745
                  Ooh! Details!

331
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,730
       You all seemed...

332
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,566
   a lot less threatening
   when there were two of us!

333
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,169
              Ah!

334
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:28,973
      This place is awful!

335
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,741
  How did I not see it before?

336
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,016
Hey! It's one of those
traveling ponies!

337
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,585
        Your song really
       inspired us!

338
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:44,022
 We decided we need to head off
 on the road to friendship too.

339
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,257
It sure beats the
road to deliveries!

340
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,093
    Yep. Sometimes traveling
     together is hard.

341
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,262
You reminded us you
can also make it fun!

342
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,597
         Thanks again!

343
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:53,332
           Whoo hoo!

344
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,871
     Steaming hot beverage?

345
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,640
         Thank you, no.

346
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,645
    What are you two doing?

347
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,080
Taking a stand!

348
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,948
By lying down!

349
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,819
      Not that you care,
      wagon trader-awayer!

350
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,288
      I'm afraid I'm still
       not interested,

351
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,325
    despite your assistant's
     convenient appearance.

352
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,561
Trixie, I came
back to apologize.

353
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,197
I should never have
traded away the wagon.

354
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,798
It wasn't mine to trade!

355
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,400
It belongs to my friend.

356
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,270
       Hmmm. If you truly
        were friends,

357
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:36,474
  I suppose I'd be honor-bound
   to reverse the trade.

358
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,542
        OK. Fine, we're friends.

359
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,978
              Best friends who
              share a deep bond,

360
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,712
        but weren't prepared for
        the emotional challenges

361
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,448
      of traveling. Happy?

362
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,483
    I am still unconvinced.

363
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,352
    Perhaps you could
     <i>prove</i> your friendship.

364
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,687
                    How!?

365
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,656
 Er... we could do our
friendship chant.

366
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,961
                      Oh, right...

367
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,064
           Our world famous
          "Chant of Friendship"!

368
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,834
That we do all the time because
 we're such great friends.

369
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:09,340
 [making it up as they go]
<i> Mmmagic, tri--mmagic.</i>

370
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:17,714
     <i> Poo-uff of sma-oke,</i>
  <i> Wondu-wave your hoof-ooves</i>

371
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:22,152
        <i> and tal-ell a</i>
      <i> lo-ittle jawww-oke!</i>

372
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:22,953
             Ha ha!

373
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,562
That was the <i>worst</i> friendship
chant I have ever heard

374
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,765
and you two were clearly
making it up as you went.

375
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,868
But! Only true friends
would be willing

376
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,304
to act so ridiculous
for one another.

377
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,006
             So you'll give back
            the wagon?

378
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,676
   Though, I'd suggest
   heading back to Ponyville.

379
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,815
   I'm not sure Saddle
   Arabia is ready for..... this.

380
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,683
    That's fair.

381
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,457
     I'm sorry your Saddle
    Arabian tour was ruined.

382
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,860
Honestly, I don't think I could
have stood one more second

383
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:03,946
          on the road.

384
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:06,931
 At a certain point, I don't
even like traveling with myself.

385
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,403
It is a lot harder
than I thought.

386
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,705
Still, I'm glad we tried.

387
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,641
Mostly so we know
not to do it again.

388
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:19,744
     I think it's made our
      friendship greater

389
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,946
  and more powerful than ever!

390
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,883
   You know, there's actually
   plenty of room in here

391
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,652
      for a one-pony nap.

392
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,687
       Is the show over?
