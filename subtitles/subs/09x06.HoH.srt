00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,100
           to do both.

420
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,235
                Hey there.
                Glad I found you

421
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,703
       because I have a
       confession to make.

422
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,438
  I... know it's hard to imagine,

423
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,308
       but I'm not really
        all that sporty.

424
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,244
    [gasp] No...!

425
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,878
 I'm sorry I was trying so hard
   to convince you otherwise.

426
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,913
      I just really wanted
       us to get along,

427
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,184
    but I guess it backfired...

428
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,853
         Do you think we
        could start over?

429
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,221
    Maybe we could watch some
   of the tournament together and..

430
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,191
      you could teach
      me some sports stuff?

431
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:01,132
               ♪♪

432
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,334
     OK, that's their goal.

433
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,503
           I'll try to remember
           that if I ever decide

434
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:09,107
         to play buckball again,
         but I probably won't.

435
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,741
             Oh, look. Pinkie
             Pie's going to flip

436
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,577
           and triple bounce the
           ball into the goal.

437
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:16,524
         [cheers]

438
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,748
How did you know that!?

439
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,983
                It's right here.

440
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,785
             Pinkie flips and
             triple bounce-bucks

441
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,754
      over 83% of her shots
      from the northwest section

442
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,324
      of the field when the wind
      is blowing from the east.

443
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:29,360
Huh. I guess this book's
kind of cool after all.

444
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,597
Look, Sky, I know
you're thinking

445
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,267
of calling it quits between
us, and after today,

446
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,535
I don't blame you,

447
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,704
but Wind and I just
made a connection!

448
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,173
     Calling it quits? What
     are you talking about?

449
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,675
You.. said you wanted
to rethink things.

450
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,944
        Yeah, things like
       having your friend

451
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,979
        help you pretend
       to be a sports pony

452
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,481
     so Wind would like you.

453
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:55,254
Wha..? [stuttering] Oh! I didn't.. What?

454
00:20:56,656 --> 00:21:00,925
                        Wha..? Me? Nah!

455
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,294
        Mom, look what
       Quibble showed me!

456
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,963
  When Fluttershy flies higher
   than the other Pegasus,

457
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:10,234
    Pinkie scores 92% of the
   time! And it just happened.

458
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,002
   Wow! You'd better watch out

459
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,704
       or you're gonna
      start to like books.

460
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,840
I guess that wouldn't be so bad.

461
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,710
         Huh. Looks like you
         didn't need sportiness,

462
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,445
 famous ponies, or lavish gifts

463
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,014
  to bond with Wind after all.

464
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,549
    Technically, he still
   needed to buy her the book,

465
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,917
         but that's it.

466
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:32,923
           [laughter]
