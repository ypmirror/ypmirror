1
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,571
     Twilight: This happened
       while we were gone?

2
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:08,240
  Applejack: Friendship quests
      beyond Equestria?

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,075
         Twilight: We're
      gonna open a school!

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,779
   Neighsay: We expect you to
     do things by the book.

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,048
    Twilight: We have a huge
         responsibility,

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,584
      and I need you all to
      do this by the book.

7
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,721
      These ponies are the
      heroes of Equestria?

8
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:24,423
  Gallus: This is just a quick
   mental health break!

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,525
      Neighsay: The school
       is under attack!

10
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,427
             Those are students!?

11
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,531
          I am shutting
        this school DOWN.

12
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,565
            Oh!

13
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:16,141
                   Twilight?

14
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,576
                 You feeling OK?

15
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:29,689
    Look on the bright side!

16
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,092
     Sure the EEA closed
     your Friendship School,

17
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,194
       but now you've got
     time to do other stuff!

18
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,728
  It's like being on vacation!

19
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,496
                 Whoa!

20
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,398
       A failure vacation!

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,734
     I'm supposed to be the
     Princess of Friendship.

22
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:44,503
 And all I did was make enemies
    with Equestria's allies,

23
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,772
        upset my friends,
      and get my school...

24
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,108
          unaccredited!

25
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,576
    THERE IS NO BRIGHT SIDE!

26
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,284
       OK then. I'm gonna
          need backup.

27
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,485
   Operation Cheer Up is a go!

28
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,990
              Come on, Twilight!

29
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,826
         You can't sit around in
        the boring dark all day!

30
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,228
            Exactly!

31
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,497
 What you need is a double dose
  of Granny Smith's apple mash.

32
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,704
       Whenever I'm sad, a
      hug from Angel Bunny

33
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,606
         always makes me
          feel better.

34
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,216
                        Oh!

35
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,885
     Uh. Maybe it's just me.

36
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:37,222
  I find that nothing brightens
  my mood like a new ensemble!

37
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,126
     [sigh] Thanks, Rarity.

38
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,295
      It's a great dress...

39
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:46,165
   [sobbing] for somepony who
   knows how to run a school.

40
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,603
You didn't tell me
this was a pity party!

41
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,339
I would've brought ice cream!

42
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,775
I appreciate you trying
to make me feel better.

43
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:58,743
 But not everything can
be fixed with dresses and cupcakes.

44
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,912
                 WHAT!

45
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,315
      I just need some time
     to be alone and think.

46
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,124
               Oh!

47
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:14,426
I wondered how
long you'd take

48
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,629
to get tired of
pillow fort pouting.

49
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,331
            Everypony's already
           tried to cheer me up.

50
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,532
                  It won't work.

51
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,235
I'm not gonna
cheer you up.

52
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,204
I'm gonna tell you
what you did wrong.

53
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,438
                    What!?

54
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,707
You gave up too easily.

55
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,177
Hey, you made me a
guidance counselor.

56
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,579
That means tough love.

57
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:34,780
             Neighsay was right.

58
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,847
            I failed.

59
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,717
   The school WAS a disaster.

60
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,185
So was I when
you met me!

61
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,621
But you showed me that
when you know in your heart

62
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,057
something is right,
you stand up for it.

63
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,592
You did that for me.

64
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,160
Why not for this?

65
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,564
   I can't go against the EEA!

66
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,867
   They're in charge of all of
    the schools in Equestria.

67
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,936
   And you're in charge of all
  the Friendship in Equestria.

68
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,738
         Why should you
        let somepony else

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,473
          stop you from
         doing your job?

70
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:02,941
But the EEA rule book--

71
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,508
             [splash]
           Doesn't matter.

72
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,713
You can write
your own rules!

73
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,881
Because you're doing
something new.

74
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,583
Something important.

75
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,819
                   You're right!

76
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,654
WHY we're doing this
is way more important

77
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,256
than HOW we're
doing this.

78
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,024
And we ARE
doing this!

79
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,660
                 Now that's the
                Twilight I know.

80
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:22,694
                 How can I help?

81
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,129
 You already have.

82
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:27,867
  [door opens] Guess what?

83
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,036
    The School of Friendship
      is back in business!

84
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,671
                     WHAT?

85
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,439
      But why?

86
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,373
                 Oh no!

87
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,440
Bad idea.

88
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,743
         Do we still get
            to guess?

89
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,013
    No offense, Twilight, but
     teaching at that school

90
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,015
   was the most boring,
   horrible, awful thing ever.

91
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,118
        Uh. Pretty sure she's gonna
          take offense to that.

92
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,253
 No, Rainbow Dash
     is right.

93
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,255
I owe you all an apology.

94
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,292
       I was so focused on
    doing things the EEA way,

95
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,860
       I didn't listen to
        any of you.

96
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,663
 I'm sorry. I
promise this time,

97
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,765
we'll run the school
like friends should.

98
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,832
     Together.

99
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:05,304
So we'd be allowed to
teach however we want to?

100
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,072
                   No more scary
                   pop quizzes?

101
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,408
        Confetti cannons
       for every creature?

102
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,882
   Whatever you need to teach
    the elements of harmony.

103
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,750
          Yippppeeeeee!

104
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,157
    Well, in that case, we're
   behind you 100%, Twilight!

105
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,427
Spike: Ahem, just
two small problems.

106
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,195
The school is still
unaccredited...

107
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,332
        And we don't have
          any students.

108
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,534
        I'll take care of
         the first part,

109
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,636
         if you five can
       round up our class.

110
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,704
                        Totally!

111
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,073
           Uh... how?

112
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,176
  Roundin' up the pony students
 ain't gonna be an issue but...

113
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:45,877
       The creatures from
       the other kingdoms

114
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,247
          seemed pretty
         upset with us.

115
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,015
Pfft. Nonsense!

116
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:53,318
I'm certain we can win them
over with our charm and style!

117
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:00,626
               Cupcake gram for
              Prince Rutherford!

118
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,561
       Why Pink Pony here?

119
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,363
       Yaks mad at ponies.

120
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,666
          Beeee-cause you don't
         have to be mad anymore!

121
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,269
  We're reopening Twilight
 Sparkle's School of Friendship

122
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,104
    and it's gonna be super-
      ooper-dooper

123
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,505
       better than before!

124
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,441
    We're ever so sorry about
      the misunderstanding.

125
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,777
        All creatures are
       of course welcome!

126
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,079
    We would be really happy
    if you sent your student

127
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,514
         back to class.

128
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,049
         It won't be the
        same without 'em!

129
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,218
We're open and ready
to start teaching...

130
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,519
                 ...right now!

131
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,389
                So? What are you
                  waiting for?

132
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,023
                Get your student
                and let's go!

133
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,993
Not happening.

134
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:36,895
      Aw, do you need me to
      do the whole apology

135
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,531
  and explanation thing again?

136
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,899
               OK.

137
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,302
Listen, missy.

138
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,537
       It's not happening
          because--

139
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,939
      YOUR STUDENT IS GONE!

140
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,541
              WHAT!

141
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,215
           Prince Rutherford: WHERE YONA!

142
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,617
     This all Ponies' fault!

143
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,952
             You're pretty quick
               to blame them.

144
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,521
                    What are you
                    hiding, Yak?

145
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:06,892
       Uh, can we just focus on
      finding our lost students?

146
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,794
                   Nice try!

147
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:12,431
       You grubs are probably
    hiding the whole lot of 'em!

148
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,934
    Please, everycreature, if
      you can just explain

149
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,069
        what happened...

150
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,872
   The students left us notes
    before they disappeared.

151
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,542
  When the school closed, they
   didn't want to say goodbye

152
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:24,643
         to each other.

153
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:28,113
       They claim they ran
     away to stay together.

154
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,015
       I can't believe it!

155
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,950
   They did learn friendship!

156
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,987
             Sorry.

157
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,956
The students couldn't have
done this by themselves.

158
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:41,326
SOME creature is hiding them!

159
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,695
If the niece of our
queen is not found soon,

160
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,632
I promise there
will be retribution!

161
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,701
     Yeah? Well, my dragons
     will burn every kingdom

162
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,571
     until we find which of
     you is hiding Smolder.

163
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,973
  Tell it to the Griffon Army.

164
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,809
       Yaks fight griffons
        and dragons!

165
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,711
         The Changeling
       Empire can't afford

166
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,380
   an international incident.

167
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,949
   If any creature blames the
     Changelings for this--

168
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,018
What are you up
to, shape-shifter?

169
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,853
            But we're friends...

170
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,155
Find the students
quickly, Twilight.

171
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:13,024
Or I fear our world
will be at war.

172
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,496
       Twilight: OK. Let's
      review what we know.

173
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,165
        Smolder, Ocellus,
       Silverstream, Yona,

174
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,300
      and Gallus
      disappeared together.

175
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,071
       That's all we know.

176
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,540
      They're probably just
      off hidin' somewhere.

177
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,843
Unless they used some kind
of spell to disappear.

178
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,980
    Ooh! Or went undercover!

179
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,717
    Maybe they were attacked
     by a ferocious shrimp!

180
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,852
    Nopony EVER expects that.

181
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,854
[gasp] Shrimps can attack?

182
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:46,024
               Nope. That's why
              nopony expects it!

183
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,796
              Whoa!

184
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,635
                    Hi, Sandbar!

185
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,637
         Are you having a party?

186
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,942
No! I'm just, uh...
really hungry.

187
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,947
We need to think
like our students.

188
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,116
   If someone told us we would
   never see each other again,

189
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,118
        what would we do?

190
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,886
      Go someplace we
       could all hang out

191
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,855
        and eat lots and
        lots of cupcakes!

192
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,126
              What..?

193
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,596
    Sandbar was friends with
  all of the missing students.

194
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,299
         And he just got
       plenty of cupcakes.

195
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,901
Huh... He was at the
farm this morning,

196
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,171
picking up a
wagonload of apples.

197
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:35,006
    And I saw him in a shop
  buying pillows and blankets!

198
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,909
      [gasp] He must be
      taking all that stuff

199
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,044
     to the other students!

200
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,512
We gotta follow him!

201
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:53,959
    Heh. This place is way cooler
     than I thought it'd be.

202
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,033
       Even<i> I'm</i> impressed.

203
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,668
        What's it called
         again, Ocellus?

204
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,504
        The Castle of the
          Two Sisters.

205
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,123
   I remembered it from class:

206
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:09,941
 Princess Twilight's History of
   Pre-Equestrian Friendships.

207
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,677
         Huh. Who knew?

208
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,146
       School was actually
       good for something!

209
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,748
  Yona not really like school.

210
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,151
   But Yona like new friends.

211
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,254
   Smolder...Like...Breathing.

212
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,588
      Silverstream: Hey, you
       guys!

213
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,789
   Sandbar is back!

214
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,498
    Cupcakes are best cakes!

215
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,166
              Agh!

216
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,274
Huh. Thanks for the
assist, Gallus.

217
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,976
 Pff. I was saving the cupcakes.

218
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,649
       Pillows, how nice!

219
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,485
     The castle is going to
     be so much more comfy.

220
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,020
            And fun!

221
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,621
          Pillow fight!

222
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,965
     Silverstream: YOU GUYS!

223
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,099
         I just found...

224
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,767
             STAIRS!

225
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,405
   And ... we care because...

226
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,674
       Stairs are awesome!

227
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,309
     We don't have anything
      like 'em underwater.

228
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,177
        Cause you know...

229
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,111
      No way to climb 'em.

230
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,547
             Ohhhh.

231
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,751
   This place has everything!

232
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,787
     If only my family back
      home could see it!

233
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,093
  I wish the other Changelings
  could meet you all.

234
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,395
   You're not nearly as
   strange as the stories say.

235
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,230
    Gee, thanks.

236
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,199
      But yeah, hanging out
      with other creatures

237
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,735
     is actually...not bad.

238
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,777
       Uh, MOST other creatures.

239
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,579
             What is THAT thing?

240
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,682
[sigh] Am I the ONLY one who
didn't sleep through

241
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,952
Professor Fluttershy's Critters
of Comfort and Conflict Class?

242
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,454
              It's a puckwudgie!

243
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,455
        Maybe I can make
        friends with it!

244
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,401
         Oops.

245
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,069
        Yak plan better.

246
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,437
             YAAAA!

247
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,666
         Think, Ocellus!

248
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,734
    Did Professor Fluttershy
     say anything about

249
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,437
     how to beat Puckwudgies
     in her lecture?

250
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,173
  Ah! I'm sorry, I can't remember.

251
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,142
I'm gonna go ahead and
guess it's not pillows,

252
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,744
apples...... or cupcakes.

253
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,481
 Wouldn't class have been about
 how to make friends with them?

254
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:05,784
        Uh, guys? They're
      getting really close...

255
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,819
        Yona not scared.

256
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,554
       Yona have friends.

257
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,835
   Is that Professor Egghead?

258
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,109
            Aw, yeah!

259
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,789
      Oh! Don't hurt them!

260
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,492
 Just ask them to leave nicely.

261
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,805
            Not bad!

262
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,273
            For pony...

263
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,843
      Wow. They're amazing.

264
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,379
   I had no idea our teachers
    were actually cool.

265
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,715
  I've been trying to tell you!

266
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,651
Did you see that!?

267
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,285
Rainbow Dash was like zooooom!

268
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,453
        And then whoooaa!

269
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,188
  The Puckwudgies went flying!

270
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,990
 And then the birds came and...

271
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,725
                   Yeah. We all
                  just lived it.

272
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:21,627
               But you're right.

273
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:25,630
      That was pretty amazing...
       even by dragon standards.

274
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,434
   Is everycreature all right?

275
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,673
You're lucky we
got here in time.

276
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,075
     You know, this probably
     isn't the safest place

277
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,377
         for a campout.

278
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,846
   Does that mean you're going
  to send us back to our homes?

279
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,583
Not exactly.

280
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,384
We have another
option in mind.

281
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,588
        We're listening.

282
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,790
    It's pretty clear you've
    already started learning

283
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,658
       friendship without
         your teachers.

284
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,194
      But we'd like to show
        you even more...

285
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,095
   if you come back to school?

286
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,467
      Not much of a choice.

287
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,637
To be honest, we felt
exactly the same way

288
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,273
when Twilight told us she
was reopening the school.

289
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,376
   But this time, we guarantee
     it shall be different.

290
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,212
         Oh, yeah. With
        class run my way,

291
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,215
    it'll be TWO HUNDRED and
     twenty percent cooler.

292
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,052
      And without the EEA,
    it'll be much friendlier.

293
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,321
      Plus all your nations
        won't go to war

294
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,522
    if you come back with us!

295
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:25,623
             Bonus!

296
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,893
         Wait, what's happening?

297
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,168
            Celestia: Twilight!

298
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,538
        I was so relieved
       to get your letter.

299
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,940
       As was Queen Novo.

300
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:45,009
   Oh, we're just glad you're
    all right, Silverstream.

301
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,713
     Don't expect a welcome
      party from me, sonny.

302
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,715
     It's time you got home.

303
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,384
I'm not leaving.

304
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,753
                     WHAT!?

305
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,054
None of us are.

306
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,189
Sorry, Thorax.

307
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,625
       Yak not understand.

308
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:01,960
         This pony joke?

309
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,262
         No. We're going
         back to school.

310
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,564
                 How? You can't
                even get inside.

311
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,671
   School is back in session.

312
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,049
    Who dared remove my seal?

313
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,985
     I did, Chancellor Neighsay.

314
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,387
       And I respectfully
     ask you to step aside,

315
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,356
   or classes will start late.

316
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,192
Classes won't start at all!

317
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,227
The EEA has spoken.

318
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,829
And NONE SHALL PASS!

319
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,901
   Yak pass if Yak say! HMPH!

320
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,005
  This is for the greater good.

321
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,140
  The school was disorganized!

322
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,042
    The teachers unqualified!

323
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:55,179
     And those dangerous and
    unpredictable "students"

324
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,015
  put ponies' lives in danger!

325
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,922
  Grr! I'll show you unpredictable.

326
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,760
                Hold on, please!

327
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:12,463
  I'm sure Princess Twilight
  Sparkle has a good explanation

328
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,165
                for all of this.

329
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,466
    I do.

330
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,168
It's true that my
School of Friendship

331
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,937
is EEA unaccredited.

332
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,372
   Look! She said it without
     doing the eye thing!

333
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,843
Then it is not a school!

334
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,111
         It's not an EEA school.

335
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,747
       It's a friendship school.

336
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,849
       With its own rules.

337
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,383
         I should know.

338
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,152
        I wrote the book.

339
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,257
   These students reminded me
      that every friendship

340
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,258
           is special.

341
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,261
     So the way we teach it
    has to be just as unique.

342
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,864
      My school is going to
     do things differently.

343
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,699
Allowing all of
these creatures

344
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,635
to attend your school...

345
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,605
changing the rules for them!
   It simply won't work!

346
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,308
   I seem to recall something
     about Earth Ponies,

347
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,913
  Unicorns and Pegasi doing
  something similar, don't you?

348
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,048
   I promise you, Chancellor,

349
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,751
       my school will help
       protect Equestria.

350
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,787
         Or destroy it.

351
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:17,662
   Hmph. How's this school gonna be
  any different from last time?

00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,431
     If you promise to stop
   singing, Smolder can stay!

387
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,099
             Wahoo!

388
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,104
    Ah.. If dragon stay, yak stay.

389
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,974
I know you will make the
Changelings proud, Ocellus.

390
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,776
                You belong here.

391
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:49,680
    Now can you show me those
   stair-things you mentioned?

392
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,915
   Aw, yeah! [giggle]

393
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,219
                     What?

394
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,654
       You belong at home.

395
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,224
       You think I care if
      you've made friends?

396
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,659
Please, Grandpa
Gruff?

397
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,898
   Wha- All right! Stop doing that!

398
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,772
   Guess I make a pretty good
    Guidance Counselor, huh?

399
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:18,376
Yes! Writing a rule book
was the most fun ever!

400
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,312
I can't wait to start working
on the new lesson plans!

401
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,481
                           Ahem.

402
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,616
With some help
from my friends.
