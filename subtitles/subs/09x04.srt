1
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:07,706
     Twilight! Look at the
      scroll I just got!

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,076
                [gasp] Do you know what
                  this means?

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,478
 Uh huh!

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,049
  Uh, I don't. What's so
  exciting about a toy crown?

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:20,185
   Oh-ho-ho, this is no toy crown.

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,755
    It's the hard-won helm
    of the Sibling Supreme!

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,957
              When Shining Armor
              and I were small,

8
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,126
                we competed over
                EVERYTHING!

9
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,541
    To keep it friendly, our
   parents gave us gold stars

10
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,376
      every time we did
       something special.

11
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,447
           Sharing...

12
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,084
     Getting good grades...

13
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,888
         Even telling a
       really funny joke!

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,190
  And at the end of each week,
     we'd add up the stars.

15
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,761
      The sibling with the
    most would win the crown

16
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,363
     of the Sibling Supreme

17
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,398
      <i>and</i> bragging rights
        till next time!

18
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,436
Guess that explains
your love of charts.

19
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,071
And so much else...

20
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,907
     I always wanted to be
    Sibling Supreme one day.

21
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,676
  Meet me at Celestia's Castle

22
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,580
   to decide who deserves the
    crown once and for all.

23
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,014
         Both: Race ya there!

24
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,651
               Guess I'll...
               watch the school?

25
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,167
       You're wearing it!?

26
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,136
Look, I know you've
always held a grudge

27
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,304
        because I left
        home with this.

28
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,140
   Grudge? Pff. What grudge?

29
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,908
Just because you've
had it for <i>way</i> longer

30
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,876
than you should have,

31
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,778
and I never got a
chance to win it back...

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,281
   With the return of Sombra,
    Princess Luna and I

33
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,251
 felt it was time to reinforce
    the castle's defenses.

34
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,887
<i>I</i> said we could
do it ourselves,

35
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,724
but some ponies
are a bit stubborn.

36
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:42,828
 So I asked our old Captain of
 the Guard to handle the job.

37
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,532
         I've taken the security
         here to a whole new level.

38
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,368
The only thing I need now
is somepony to test it.

39
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,338
         [gasp] You want me to break
         into Celestia's castle?

40
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,975
If you can get past my
defenses, steal the crown,

41
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,444
     and get out, you'll be
      Sibling Supreme.

42
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,512
                      Forever.

43
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,349
       [dreamy] Forever!

44
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,719
BUT, if you fail,
I keep the crown.

45
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,589
             DEAL! Wait! Are you
             sure this counts?

46
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,824
            Mom and Dad aren't
            giving us any stars...

47
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,826
   Celestia: I will represent
      their authority.

48
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,229
    And thank you, Twilight.
     Your help will reveal

49
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,130
      if there are any
     holes in our security.

50
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,400
               And there aren't.

51
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,769
       I've designed a
     multi-tiered, impenetrable,

52
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,004
                triple-backed-up
                line of defense.

53
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,074
    <i> The castle is</i>
     <i> surrounded by shards</i>

54
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,376
  <i> of Queen Chrysalis' throne.</i>

55
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,446
   <i> Thanks to Starswirl, its</i>
   <i> anti-magic powers are now</i>

56
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,350
<i> tuned to stop anycreature from</i>
 <i> using a spell to get inside.</i>

57
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,652
   <i> You can't fly in either.</i>

58
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,123
     <i> Giant fans keep any</i>
     <i> creature from flying</i>

59
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,690
   <i> too close to the castle.</i>

60
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,763
   <i> Plus the entrances to the</i>
   <i> tunnels below the castle</i>

61
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:55,101
 <i> have been sealed. So there's</i>
  <i> no underground access.</i>

62
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,303
    <i> And even if you could</i>
   <i> get in, which you can't,</i>

63
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,072
       <i> I've doubled the</i>
      <i> ranks of security.</i>

64
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,575
     <i> Ponies protect every</i>
      <i> hallway and door,</i>

65
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,911
   <i> which can only be opened</i>
   <i> with Royal Guard medals.</i>

66
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,215
 Even if you brought an army...

67
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:14,153
    the throne room is the
   safest spot in Equestria.

68
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,288
        I rigged a floor
        trap to activate

69
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,289
    at the slightest touch.

70
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,061
  But say you avoid the floor...

71
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,229
         Still no luck.

72
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,065
     Because I've employed
     Nature's alarm system.

73
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,138
             Geese?

74
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,775
       You can hear their honks
       all the way in Ponyville.

75
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,445
                 Plus they bite.

76
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,320
So that's what we're up against.

77
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,390
      Huh. That's a barrel and
      a half of obstacles,

78
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,193
plus a bushel and a peck
of impenetrability.

79
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,629
    And all this is to win
   some fillyhood competition

80
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,198
       with your brother?

81
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,935
      It's more than that!
     OK, it's exactly that.

82
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,170
      ...And to protect
       Celestia's castle!

83
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,740
    If it means that much to
    you, Twilight, we're in.

84
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:09,908
I was already in!

85
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,277
C'mon, who doesn't want
to hang with geese!?

86
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,880
                 Of course we'll
                 help. But how?

87
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,816
  Shining Armor may have come
  up with some great security,

88
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,919
     but he'll never guess
       Twilight's plan.

89
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,587
    We play to our strengths

90
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,989
     and defeat all of the
      security measures.

91
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,091
      That way, if one of
      us fails, the others

92
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,160
     will still have a shot
     at getting the crown.

93
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,463
 Pinkie, you'll distract the
 guards with a surprise party.

94
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,499
     Yes sir, Twilight sir!

95
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,568
  Applejack, you'll buck your
  way into the sealed tunnels.

96
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,272
  Rainbow Dash, if anypony can
  outfly those wind turbines,

97
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,173
           it's you.

98
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,642
       Rarity, you'll sew
       us guard costumes

99
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,410
 so we can sneak past security.

100
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,546
  Then Fluttershy will disable
  the throne room alarm

101
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,880
     by charming the geese.

102
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,753
It's from Shining Armor.

103
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:58,323
 Dear Twily, Hope your
idea isn't just...[muttering]

104
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,692
Tunnels! He guessed
your whole plan!

105
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:01,860
                   WHAT!?

106
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,095
Pinkie party, Rarity costumes...

107
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,832
   Signed, the future Sibling
   Supreme? Oh, come on!

108
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,269
   Rarity: Twilight, darling.

109
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,105
    Nopony knows you better
    than your own brother.

110
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,607
       So you're saying
       I should give up?

111
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,343
        I'm <i>saying</i> your
       brother will win.

112
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,112
    No matter how
    brilliant your plan is,

113
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,681
      no matter how many
      variations you try,

114
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,649
      it will be something
      your brother expects

115
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,120
and he'll always win. Unless...

116
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,756
       When the perfect
      chance comes along,

117
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,826
   you do something he can't
   expect. Then, you'll win.

118
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,629
You've been practicing
that speech, haven't you?

119
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,365
   A little bit. It felt like
    I rushed. Did I rush it?

120
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,566
Absolutely not.

121
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,168
                         Oh! No!

122
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,770
     Yeah, it was fastish.

123
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,173
 We have to do the opposite of
  what Shining Armor expects.

124
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,677
   Therefore, Twilight cannot
     mastermind the plan...

125
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,512
           BUT I CAN!

126
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,248
That's...definitely
unexpected.

127
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:04,956
Uh.. how is YOU making
a break-in plan

128
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,292
the opposite of
Twilight doing it?

129
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:11,330
          Because.. my plan is for
          each of us to devise

130
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,598
              our own unexpected
              part of it!

131
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,366
        Allow me to demonstrate.

132
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,777
    We're looking for a
     pony with information.

133
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,349
        We got questions, and
        you're gonna serve us up

134
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,184
                   some answers,
                   juice jockey.

135
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,952
Where is the secret
entrance to the passages

136
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,687
under Canterlot Castle?

137
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,457
 Shining Armor sealed them all.
  There is no secret entrance.

138
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,492
There's always a
secret entrance!

139
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,595
            So make like a glass
            of OJ and spill!

140
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,098
Ooh! Ooh! I know what I can do!

141
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,935
You're gonna need a lookout, so
 I can be your eye in the sky!

142
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,437
    Too low, silly, up here!

143
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,915
   Oh, Pinkie! That tickles!

144
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,788
             What..!?

145
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,725
  How about somethin' a little
  more down to earth. Like...

146
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,495
  I distract the guard ponies
  with a farewell performance

147
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,130
  by my alter ego, famous
  country western super-star,

148
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,532
          Apple Chord!

149
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,502
       I didn't know you
       had an alter-ego.

150
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,137
  And why would she be giving
   a farewell performance?

151
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,307
    Well, it's a long story.

152
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:32,944
       Back on the farm,

153
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,714
    playin' music was about
    makin' her family smile.

154
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,786
   Word of her talent spread,

155
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:44,289
   and soon Apple Chord
    was playin' real shows.

156
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,560
    The more she played, the
    bigger those shows got.

157
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,235
     But she missed playin'
      for her family.

158
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,840
So one day, she gave it all up.

159
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,149
    Seeing her family smile
    was all she ever wanted

160
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,284
        from her music.

161
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,620
  Of course, Apple Chord could
  come out of retirement

162
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,558
      for a farewell
     concert this one time...

163
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,960
       Wait. Did you just
        make all that up

164
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,962
  or did that actually happen?

165
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,397
             Um...

166
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,400
Doesn't matter. It's
perfect! Fluttershy? Spike?

167
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,702
      I guess the opposite
      of what I'm good at

168
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,605
   is [gasp] being in small spaces....

169
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,174
        I always wanted
       to be a super spy...

170
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,909
      Is that the opposite
      of anything?

171
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,215
   Special Agent Fluttershy,
    target detected below.

172
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,152
It's almost too easy.

173
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,976
 Huh. I guess I'm the only one left
 that still needs a plan.

174
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,481
  Oh, no, darling, that IS the
  plan. You shall do nothing!

175
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,485
Shining Armor definitely
won't expect that.

176
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,906
 Applejack? What are you doing?

177
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:47,045
  Applejack? Heh, heh, who's
  that? My name's Apple Chord

178
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,514
    and I've got a couple
    of songs to play for ya.

179
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,318
 Clap your hooves if you know
'em. And a one and a two and a..

180
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,995
  The Wonderbolts did a flyby,

181
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,031
      and the only way
     past those giant fans

182
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,233
      and into the castle
      ducts is here.

183
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,535
       But there's no
       room for mistakes!

184
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,504
Pinkie: Just like
space travel!

185
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:18,243
 Uh, Pinkie, we're not actually
  going INTO space, right?

186
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,945
No, silly! I'm
dropping you two off

187
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,380
as soon as we're
close to the fans.

188
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,850
Then I'M going
into space!

189
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,757
You're up to
something, Twily...

190
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,560
       Nope. Just looking
        at the flowers.

191
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,196
         [sniff] Ahhh.

192
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,231
             Right.....

193
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,672
      Ooh! Maybe Rarity's
     plan WILL work!

194
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:51,042
 Canterlot, we have a problem!

195
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,647
               I know that one's
               a crowd favorite.

196
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,648
              What's say we play
              it one more time?

197
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,084
 And a one, and a two and a --

198
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,557
 A distraction's a distraction.

199
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,000
                 Where's Spike
                 and Fluttershy?

200
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,569
                Did they make it
                into the castle?

201
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:22,373
They jumped out right before
the balloon went TBBBTHHHH.

202
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,076
But that's all I could see
without being in space.

203
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,145
Where I didn't get to go.

204
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,882
 Let's hope Rarity and Rainbow
   Dash had better luck.

205
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,488
      What's this? CLOSED!?

206
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,390
     Heh. The Seedy Juice Joint
     is always closed

207
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:39,591
       around this time.

208
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,193
           Then how are we meant to shake
           down Ne'er Do Wells

209
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,562
                for information!?

210
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,530
      What sort of
    information do you need?

211
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,866
             Um, the location to
             a secret entrance

212
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,135
           to the passages under
           Canterlot Castle?

213
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:51,569
You mean that one?

214
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,273
     Yes. Thank you.
      That will do nicely.

215
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,682
Zephyr Breeze!?

216
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:09,354
     Oh, ho ho ho, darling; this
     couldn't be more perfect...

217
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,556
            How is this perfect!?

218
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,758
          He's the most annoying
          pony in Equestria,

219
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,527
               and he's totally
               obsessed with me,

220
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,763
         and we have to come up
         with a way to distract-

221
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,400
    Oh, no! No way! Uh, uh!

222
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,275
Wha-? Rainbow! I knew
you'd come running

223
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,776
when you heard I
got this job.

224
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,579
The mares love a pony
in uniform, am I right?

225
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,847
                  Not really...

226
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,254
        I mean, uh... totally!

227
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,423
       Why don't you.. step
         into the light

228
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,928
     so I can see how
   [groan] <i>handsome</i> you look in it?

229
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,542
  I told the Sarge that gold
  kinda clashes with my aura,

230
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,844
    but apparently, they
     aren't big on "input".

231
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,380
    Still, I totally manage
    to rock the look,

232
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,115
        don't you think?

233
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,419
        Yep. You're real
        guard material...

234
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,055
I'm part of the castle team
now, so I'm basically...

235
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,323
Whoa, we got a swooner!

236
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,126
It's good you're
finally being honest

237
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,762
with your feelings
for me, Rainbows.

238
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,130
                [gag] Yech!

239
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,131
The truth is such a gift.

240
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,301
Like, I had to follow my bliss
to see guarding is my calling.

241
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,871
 Like look at me go. I'm going
to walk over here and I go woo!

242
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,072
   Over there! And I go yeah!

243
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,058
   And sometimes I just stand
  like this and look real cool

244
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,143
       and I go down the
       hallway going...

245
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,867
   Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

246
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:48,987
             Phew.

247
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,590
     We'll have to glide to
    the throne. No flapping.

248
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,574
  Sister! <i>Another</i> false alarm

249
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,942
       from Shining
      Armor's guard geese!

250
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:15,980
  We should have heard by now.

251
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,515
Something must have gone wrong!

252
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,283
     Pinkie: Probably
      several somethings.

253
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,155
  No lookout, no distraction,

254
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,090
       and no word from
       the ponies inside!

255
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,059
     I'm starting to think
     this whole operation

256
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,794
     might be a giant flop.

257
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:38,838
            Oh, no!

258
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,056
                Gee, Fluttershy,

259
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,873
            I thought your whole
            "small spaces" thing

260
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,909
           was just part of the
          plan to be unexpected.

261
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,545
   Once I got trapped in the
   Castle of the Two Sisters,

262
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,714
      and Angel Bunny and
       I were separated.

263
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,917
Now whenever I'm in a tiny room,
it's all I can think about!

264
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,154
I was so worried he felt
alone and forgotten.

265
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,356
                    I know what
                    that's like...

266
00:15:58,758 --> 00:15:59,958
What do you mean?

267
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,961
    I was always excited to
    be a part of Twilight's

268
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,064
and Shining Armor's rivalry,
like I was their little brother,

269
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,733
    but they never really
    thought of me that way.

270
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,337
I know they both have a special
 place in their heart for you,

271
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,740
      but sibling dynamics
      are hard. Trust me.

272
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,675
   Right. Zephyr Breeze.

273
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,944
     Honestly, he could
      learn a lot from you

274
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,279
         about being a
        little brother.

275
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,417
   I am sick of being lost
 in these slimy corridors too,

276
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,886
  but you shouldn't pull every
  lever you come across!

277
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,521
    Half of them are traps!

278
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,091
    And the other half might
     open a secret passage

279
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,225
         to the castle!

280
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,260
              IT'S NOT
            WORTH THE RISK!

281
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,194
                   Oh, hello, Spike.

282
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,397
    Even if we did find our
     way back to the castle,

283
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,198
             we'd still have all
             of those guards--

284
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,767
              SPIKE? FLUTTERSHY!

285
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,437
             W-What are you guys
             doing down here?

286
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,739
        We er.. kind of fell
       through the floor.

287
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,642
               I don't think our
               plan is working.

288
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,443
If we've both
hit dead ends,

289
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:56,080
perhaps we should return to
the outside and revaluate.

290
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,984
              Ech!

291
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,389
            Psssst!

292
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,361
What are you all doing out here?

293
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:14,666
 In retrospect, our plan might
 have been too unexpected.

294
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:19,337
[gasp] Every part of it failed? Oh,
now I'll never get the crown!

295
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,274
Maybe we should go back to
 doing things the Twilight way.

296
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,410
      You mean, the
     totally expected way?

297
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,162
   It may not be a surprise,

298
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,413
  but you have a pretty good
  record for planning things.

299
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,686
    Then I guess it's worth
     a try. Thanks, Spike.

300
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,687
                 What are little
                 brothers for?

301
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,457
OK. You all know
what to do!

302
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,344
      At least one part of
      our unexpected plan

303
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,412
      worked unexpectedly.

304
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,128
To be fair, it was never made
specifically clear to me

305
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,965
what "guarding" actually
means. So this is on you.

306
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,704
     I'm strong, Twilight,
     but not even I

307
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,573
  can buck through solid rock.

308
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,075
That's why I brought
a specialist.

309
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,592
  [deep voice] Next shift. You're on break.

310
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,843
        You've been
        glaring so hard!

311
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,512
  Who wants a feather massage?

312
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,817
    We mapped this out when
    we got lost down here.

313
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,654
  The lever to the secret
 hallway entrance should be...

314
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:17,455
             Here.

315
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,130
  I can't believe this worked!

316
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:28,067
  I guess sometimes the best
  plan is the one you expect.

317
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,070
  All I have to do now is fly
  over and take the crown,

318
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,672
      and I'll be Sibling
       Supreme forever!

319
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,907
                   Not exactly.

320
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,878
          Oh, come on!

321
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,747
Gotta admit, it was
unexpected for you to do

322
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,950
everything exactly how
I thought you would.

323
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,086
      But you should know
     by now there's no way

324
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:51,055
        to beat the true
        SIBLING SUPREME!

325
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,891
     I am sorry, Twilight,
     but it looks as though

326
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,928
      Shining Armor has
      truly won the crown.

327
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,796
Spike: That's the thing about looks...

328
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,266
   ...they can be deceiving!

329
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:02,767
                    Spike!?

330
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,036
How in Equestria
did you do it!?

331
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,405
    Come on. You two don't
    think you have the only

332
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:10,642
     sibling rivalry. I had
      an inside pony help.

333
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,346
    It wasn't hard to miss
  there was some disagreement

334
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,415
 on the whole "security" thing.

335
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,151
     Luna: I said we could
       do it ourselves,

336
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,354
      but some ponies are
      a bit more stubborn...

337
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,957
      <i> So, while Shining</i>
     <i> Armor went on and on</i>

338
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,159
    <i> about all his improved</i>
    <i> security measures,</i>

339
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,228
   <i> Luna and I struck a deal.</i>

340
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,430
     <i> She put Zephyr in</i>
    <i> charge of the catacombs</i>

341
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,832
   <i> and helped keep Celestia</i>
  <i> out of the castle hallways.</i>

342
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:38,402
   <i> Once Luna was on board, I</i>
   <i> just had to do my part...</i>

343
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,938
   <i> ...and make sure we</i>
   <i> stuck to Twilight's plan,</i>

344
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,674
 <i> so we'd all get to the throne</i>
  <i> room at the same time.</i>

345
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,843
     <i> I knew Shining Armor</i>
     <i> would let it play out</i>

346
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,612
        <i> until the last</i>
       <i> possible second.</i>

347
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,314
   <i> Then, while everyone was</i>
  <i> distracted by his gloating,</i>

348
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:54,151
    <i> all Luna had to do was</i>
  <i> float the crown.. over to me.</i>

349
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,189
      Ahem.

350
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:02,727
I er.. apologize for not listening
to your concerns, sister.

351
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,462
It seems we need
to make adjustments

352
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:08,198
to account for threats <i>inside</i>
the castle as well as out.

353
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,667
If you agree..?

354
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,470
               If you think it's
               worth discussing...

355
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:17,475
     So... if Twilight and
    Shining Armor failed...

356
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:18,943
      who gets the crown?

357
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:24,915
The TRUE Sibling Supreme. Spike.

358
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:25,783
              Huh?

359
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,086
              The little brother...
              we've always had!
