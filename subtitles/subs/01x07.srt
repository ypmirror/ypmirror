1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,893
Not too fast now, Angel bunny.

2
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:16,099
You don't wanna get a tummy ache.

3
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:23,379
You really should eat more
than that, don't you think?

4
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:26,427
It's not playtime yet.

5
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:30,813
I know you wanna run, but...

6
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:32,731
...just three more bites.

7
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,117
Two more bites?

8
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:36,552
One more bite?

9
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,507
Pretty please.

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,154
Oh... goodness.

11
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:44,478
Are you okay?

12
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:48,121
Are you coughing because there's
a carrot stuck in your throat?

13
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:50,771
Because you need some water?

14
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:57,574
Because of that giant cloud
of scary black smoke?

15
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:01,416
I'll take that as a yes.

16
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,871
Help! Help!

17
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,378
Please? Help?

18
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:48,329
There's... there's a horrible cloud of smoke.

19
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,033
It's headed this way and...

20
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,367
Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me.

21
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:58,018
Future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder.

22
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,868
246... 247...

23
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,366
This calls for a celebration!

24
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:03,790
Oh... No, Pinkie Pie.

25
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,832
This is no time for celebration.
This is a time for panic. For...

26
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,901
I'm gonna need balloons!

27
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:12,202
One for everypony in Ponyville.

28
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:13,850
There's... there's smoke.

29
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:16,380
And... and where there's
smoke, there's fire. And...

30
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:17,218
Let's see...

31
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,453
-That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
-...254, 255...

32
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:22,514
No, wait.

33
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:23,695
7!

34
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:26,392
Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.

35
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,860
We're all gonna have to start over.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,633
In a new village. Because ours is gonna be...

37
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,353
Hey Rainbow Dash! Wait up!

38
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:37,439
Oh, please. This is an emergency.
I need everypony to...

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,539
Listen up!

40
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:42,030
Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.

41
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:45,297
That's what I've been trying to...

42
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,526
But don't worry.

43
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:51,180
I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia
informing me that it is not coming from a fire.

44
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,027
Oh, thank goodness.

45
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,375
It's coming from a dragon.

46
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,818
A... d-d-d-dragon...?

47
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:05,028
What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled
is a full-grown dragon doin' here in Equestria?

48
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:06,007
Sleeping.

49
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:09,925
According to Princess Celestia,
he's taking a nap.

50
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,651
His snoring is what's causing all the smoke.

51
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:16,134
He should really see a doctor.
That doesn't sound healthy at all.

52
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:19,286
Well, at least he's not snoring fire.

53
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,470
What are we meant to do about it?

54
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:23,220
I'll tell you what we're meant to do.

55
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:25,223
Give 'im a boot. Take that!

56
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:27,851
And that!

57
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:33,287
We need to encourage him
to take a nap somewhere else.

58
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:37,072
Princess Celestia has given us
this mission and we must not fail.

59
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:40,772
If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke
for the next one hundred years.

60
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,949
Huh. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.

61
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,893
All right, everypony.
I need you to gather supplies quickly.

62
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,671
We've got a long journey ahead of us.

63
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:50,623
Let's meet back here in less than an hour.

64
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:54,514
Okay, girls! You heard her.
The fate of Equestria is in our hoofs.

65
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,551
Do we have what it takes?

66
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,601
We can do it!

67
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,668
Um... Actually...

68
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:24,949
Oh... I mean...

69
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,986
Much better! Onward!

70
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:43,886
Let's go!

71
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,570
Um... let's not?

72
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:51,929
All right, girls. Listen up.

73
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,654
I'm mapping out the fastest route...

74
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:57,305
...but we've all got to keep a good pace if we
expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.

75
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,286
M-m-mountain?

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,855
The dragon is in that cave at the very top.

77
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:03,254
Look pretty cold up there.

78
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:07,242
You bet it is. The higher you go,
the chillier it gets.

79
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:09,019
Good thing I've brought my scarf.

80
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,970
Ooo... Pretty.

81
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,826
Oh, yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy.

82
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,548
Um... excuse me. Twilight?

83
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:28,740
-I know you're busy, but...
-Uh-huh.

84
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:30,575
Oh, we could go this way.

85
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:33,048
-But if I could just have a second...
-Uh-huh.

86
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,018
Now, we wanna avoid that.

87
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:38,318
So, um... I was thinking that...

88
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,427
Um... maybe I should just stay here at Ponyville.

89
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:45,039
-Uh-huh.
-Oh! Good.

90
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:46,688
I'll stay here and...

91
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,323
Wait! You have to come.

92
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:51,107
Your way with wild animals
will surely come in handy.

93
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,026
I don't think I...

94
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:55,156
Oh, and don't worry about your
little friends in the meadow.

95
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:56,937
Spike's got it covered while you're gone.

96
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:58,214
You can count on me.

97
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,842
Hey! Hey! Wait!

98
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:05,443
I don't know I think he's up to the task. Maybe...

99
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:08,028
But... but...

100
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,671
Are you sure you want
Fluttershy to come along?

101
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,053
I mean, that pony is afraid of her own shadow.

102
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:16,187
She's just gonna slow us down.

103
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:17,746
Oh, she's just a little nervous.

104
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:20,250
Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine.

105
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,423
All right, girls!

106
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:29,939
Move out!

107
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:31,808
But... but...

108
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,573
Wow... What was that?

109
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:45,534
That is what it sound like
when a dragon snores.

110
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,383
It's... it's so...

111
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:49,484
...high.

112
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,669
Well, it IS a mountain.

113
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,127
I'm gonna fly up there and check it out!

114
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,276
Hold on now. I think
we should all go up together.

115
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,867
Safety in numbers and all.

116
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:02,312
Oh, all right.

117
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,610
I hear the only thing that sparkles
more than the dragon's scales...

118
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:10,273
...are the jewels they use to build their nests.

119
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:14,871
If I play my cards right, I might be
able to convince him to part with a few.

120
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,962
Welcome to my cave, Rarity?
Care for a diamond?

121
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:26,472
Girls! This is no laughing matter!

122
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:29,607
Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures.

123
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,627
What do you think the dragon will be like?

124
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:34,343
Fluttershy?

125
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:36,962
Hey! What are you waiting for?

126
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,570
An invitation?

127
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,610
Ooo! I think I have one in my bag!

128
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,275
It... it's so... so...

129
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,740
...steep.

130
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,608
Well, it IS a cliff.

131
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,707
You could just... oh, I don't know, fly up here?

132
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:55,230
Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it.
Flap those wings.

133
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:57,202
O... okay.

134
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,530
We don't have time for this.

135
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:16,136
What are you doing?

136
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:18,976
I'll need this if I'm gonna take her
around the mountain another way.

137
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,752
Uh... Around the mountain?!

138
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:24,268
That's gonna take them forever.

139
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:33,182
Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety split.

140
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,385
WOOHOO! I win again!

141
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,012
Ugh... That's thirty-five games in a row.

142
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:43,660
Best of seventy-one?

143
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:49,269
We... made... it...

144
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,330
Told you it was gonna take them forever.

145
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:08,031
Your turn, Fluttershy.

146
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,143
But it's so wide.

147
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:14,416
Come on, Fluttershy.
We should be much farther along by now.

148
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,754
You could just leap on over.

149
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:17,875
I...

150
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:21,331
I don't know.

151
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:25,351
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's just a hop, skip and a jump.

152
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:26,687
See?

153
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:29,225
<i>It's not very far
just move your little rump</i>

154
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:32,025
<i>You can make it if you try
with a hop, skip and jump</i>

155
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:33,319
We don't have time for this.

156
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,862
<i>A hop, skip and jump
just move your little rump</i>

157
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,771
<i>A hop, skip and jump
A hop, skip and jump</i>

158
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:39,215
<i>Ahopskipandjump
Ahopskipandjump</i>

159
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:40,184
<i>Ahopskipandjump!</i>

160
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,871
Okay. Here I go.

161
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:44,587
A hop...

162
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:47,021
-That's it!
-You're almost there.

163
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:47,961
...skip...

164
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:49,837
Just don't look down.

165
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,082
I guess I forgot to jump.

166
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:10,742
Let's keep it down.

167
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,538
According to my map, we're
entering an avalanche zone.

168
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:16,168
The smallest peep could
cause a huge rockslide.

169
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,276
An... an ava... ava...

170
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:21,115
Shhh!

171
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,390
AVALA...

172
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:09,302
Oh no! Help!

173
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:17,280
Everypony okay?

174
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:19,418
Thanks to you I am.

175
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,422
Let's do it again!

176
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:29,628
This is why a girl always
packs extra accessories.

177
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,949
Oh, please tell me I brought
a tiara that goes with this.

178
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:40,179
I think we've got bigger problems than making
sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.

179
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,094
Sorry.

180
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:45,712
Oh, no big whoop, sugar cube.

181
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:47,824
Yeah! We'll just have to...

182
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,755
...climb over.

183
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,607
My apologies.

184
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,430
Not *your* fault.

185
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:20,007
Still think it was a good idea
to bring Fluttershy along?

186
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:22,004
We're about to find out.

187
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:24,474
We're here.

188
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,594
Rainbow Dash, you'll use
your wings to clear the smoke.

189
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,759
Rarity and Pinkie Pie...

190
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,610
...you create a diversion to distract
the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.

191
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:47,741
Applejack, you're ready with
the apples in case he decides to attack.

192
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:52,710
But it shouldn't come to that...

193
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:55,463
...because Fluttershy will do what
she needs to do to wake him up...

194
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:59,474
...and between the two of us, we should be able
to get him to understand why he needs to go.

195
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:00,952
Is everypony ready?

196
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:06,680
Okay then. We're going in.

197
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:12,781
So, what is the best way to wake up
a sleeping dragon without upsetting him?

198
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:14,245
Fluttershy?

199
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:16,629
Oh, come on.

200
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,637
Come on!

201
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,970
We have to do this.

202
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,812
Now!

203
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:27,432
Every... second longer that dragon...
sleeps is another...

204
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:32,640
...acre of Equestria that is covered in... smoke.

205
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:37,663
I... I... I can't go in the cave.

206
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:42,370
Oh great. She's scared of caves now too.

207
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:45,427
I'm not scared of caves. I'm scared of...

208
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,378
What's that, sugar cube?

209
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,468
I'm scared of d...

210
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:51,227
What?

211
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,445
I'm scared of dragons!

212
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:06,605
But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful
talent dealing with all kinds of animals.

213
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,421
Yes, because they're not dragons.

214
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:14,448
Oh, come on! We've seen you walk right up
to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.

215
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:17,422
Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.

216
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:20,223
Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.

217
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:24,483
Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic,
terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing...

218
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:27,793
...sharp-scale-having, horn-wearing,
smoke-snoring, could-eat-a-pony-in-one-bite...

219
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:30,543
...totally all grown up dragon.

220
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,504
But if you're so afraid of dragons...

221
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:40,534
...why didn't you say something
before we came all the way up here?

222
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:42,599
I was afraid to.

223
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:46,249
All of us are scared of that dragon.

224
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:47,693
I'm not.

225
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:50,897
Almost all of us are scared of that dragon.

226
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,896
But we've got a job to do.

227
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:55,958
So get in there with Twilight and
show her what you're made of.

228
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:58,282
I... I...

229
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,727
I just...

230
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:02,341
...can't.

231
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:04,399
Oh, Fluttershy.

232
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,622
I'm going in.

233
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:11,718
He probably just doesn't
realize what he's doing.

234
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:13,198
Right?

235
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,917
Mister dragon.

236
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,274
Excuse me.

237
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,038
Mister dragon.

238
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,819
Oh, good. You're awake.

239
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,148
Please allow me to introduce myself.

240
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,583
My name is Twilight...

241
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:52,474
...Sparkle and my friends and I are
residents here in Equestria...

242
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:55,217
...Ponyville to be exact.

243
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:58,700
We come here to ask that you find
another spot to take your nap.

244
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,114
It' just that you seem to be
doing an awful lot of snoring...

245
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:05,044
...and every time you do, you
send out a terrible cloud of smoke...

246
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:11,269
Equestria simply can't survive
a hundred years in a dark haze.

247
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,770
You understand, don't you?

248
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,620
So you'll find another place to sleep?

249
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:36,257
So much for... persuading him.

250
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:38,668
Now what?

251
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,862
Obviously, this situation just
calls for a little "pony charm".

252
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,752
Allow me, girls.

253
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,827
I'm so sorry to interru-hupt...

254
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:55,679
...but I couldn't possibly head back home without
mentioning what handsome scales you have.

255
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,662
And those scales have to be hidden away
in some silly cave for a hundred years?

256
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:08,779
Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing
and be out there. Showing them off.

257
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,633
Obviously, I would be more than happy to
keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.

258
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,142
I was this close to getting that diamond.

259
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,723
You mean... getting rid of that dragon?

260
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,178
Oh... yeah. Sure.

261
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,485
What in tarnation...?

262
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,969
Darling, you look ridiculous.

263
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,295
Exactly!

264
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,679
Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way
to get someone on your side.

265
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:39,014
Hi!

266
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,805
Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh.
Or sharing.

267
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,353
Alright, that's it.

268
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,992
We've tried persuasion, charm...

269
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,181
...whatever it is Pinkie Pie does...

270
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:55,418
It's time to stop wasting time!

271
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:56,819
I'm going in.

272
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,307
Rainbow! No!

273
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,277
GET OUT!

274
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:08,956
Sorry.

275
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:39,592
How dare you?

276
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:42,902
HOW DARE YOU?!

277
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,202
Listen here, mister!

278
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:48,745
Just because you're big
doesn't mean you get to be a bully.

279
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:52,797
You may have huge teeth and sharp scales
and snore-smoke and breathe fire...

280
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,937
...but you do not, I repeat, YOU DO NOT...

281
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:59,073
HURT. MY. FRIENDS!

282
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,372
You got that?

283
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,086
Well?

284
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,411
BUT THAT RAINBOW ONE KICKED ME.

285
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:13,785
And I am very sorry about that.

286
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,629
But you're bigger than she is
and you should know better.

287
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,926
You should also know better
than to take a nap...

288
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:23,364
...where your snoring can become
a health hazard to other creatures.

289
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:24,987
BUT I...

290
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:27,276
Don't you "but I" me, mister.

291
00:19:27,277 --> 00:19:29,925
Now what do you have to say for yourself?

292
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,040
I said...

293
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,841
What do you have to say for yourself?!

294
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,576
There, there. No need to cry.

295
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:50,074
You're not a bad dragon.
You've just made a bad decision.

296
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:55,131
Now go pack your things. You'll just need
to find a new place to sleep. That's all.

297
00:19:57,534 --> 00:20:00,188
You did it! I knew you could do it!

298
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,231
I said, come back here!

299
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:22,985
How does Fluttershy put up
with you furry little things?

300
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:23,967
Spike.

301
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:25,692
Take a letter.

302
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:28,594
With pleasure.

303
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:30,164
"Dear Princess Celestia."

304
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:33,450
"I am happy to report that the dragon
has departed our fair country..."

305
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,846
"...and that it was my good friend Fluttershy,
who convinced him to go."

306
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,212
"This adventure has taught me to
never lose faith in your friends."

307
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:42,726
"They can be an amazing source of strength..."

308
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:45,664
"...and can help you overcome
even your greatest fears."

309
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:48,926
"Always your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle."

310
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:51,492
Twilight! You gotta come see this!

311
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:54,767
She's just five away from a new pony record.

312
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:57,254
247... 248...

313
00:20:57,954 --> 00:20:59,043
DRAGON!

314
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:07,160
Why are you laughing?!
That awful dragon is back!

315
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:12,089
Pinkie Pie, you scared me.

316
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:16,653
I mean... uh, you broke my concentration.

317
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:22,910
It's okay, Rainbow Dash.
Not everypony can be as brave as me.

318
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:33,798
