1
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,070
    Order, order everypony!

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,738
        I hereby call to
       order this meeting

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,840
 of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club!

4
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:13,745
    First order of business:

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,481
    Let's celebrate the one
    and only Rainbow Dash!

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,949
    Yay! She's amazing. Now
    if there's nothing else,

7
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,718
 that concludes this meeting of
 the Rainbow Dash Fan Club.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,986
   Thank you all for coming.
    Any questions?

9
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:24,023
              Huh?

10
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:25,857
       Meeting adjourned!

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,465
   I'd like to call to order
   the first ever meeting

12
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,802
    of the newest and
     most exciting club...

13
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:39,972
  of which I am the president,
  founding, and only member...

14
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,974
     The Washouts Fan Club!

15
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,018
    Oh, hey Scootaloo, I was
     just in the neighbor--

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,487
        Oh, what's this?

17
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,090
Did I interrupt your
fan club meeting?

18
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,960
        Hey! What are
        you doing here?

19
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,296
I could ask you
the same question!

20
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:41,267
   Oh uh, you know... stuff.

21
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,269
   Definitely not starting a
   new fan club or anything...

22
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,338
HA! It's no use
pretending.

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,840
I heard everything
when I was outside eavesdropping

24
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,776
like I do for
every meeting!

25
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,544
        You eavesdrop on
         every meeting?

26
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,079
        That's... weird.

27
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,816
Well, sure it sounds weird
when you say it out loud.

28
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,285
And I probably shouldn't because
eavesdropping is wrong,

29
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,286
          but still...

30
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,689
Why are you starting
a new fan club?

31
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:07,392
   I just think maybe it's
   time for me to explore...

32
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,994
        other fan clubs.

33
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,502
   What is a "The Washouts?"

34
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:21,473
Only the newest and greatest and
ONLY stunt troupe in Equestria!

35
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,841
         Stunt troupe?

36
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,076
     How can I explain it?
     Like the Wonderbolts,

37
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,847
     just TWENTY BAJILLION
     PERCENT COOLER.

38
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,049
       Twenty bajillion!?

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,119
  They do all sorts of extreme
stunts that focus on daredevilry

40
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,254
     and sheer guts, rather
    than boring old

41
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,123
   flight-and-formation junk.

42
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,560
       Boring old flight
      and formation junk!?

43
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,662
Are you just repeating
everything I say?

44
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,497
     Only because my brain
    feels like it's strapped

45
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,432
    to one of those rockets
    about to explode.

46
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,634
So you do
 get it!

47
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,902
Aren't they awesome?

48
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,942
      Can you believe she
      actually said that?

49
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:01,446
 Pfft. Well, yeah, eavesdropping on
 every meeting is kinda weird.

50
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,784
 I mean she basically said that
  the Wonderbolts aren't cool!

51
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,288
 And.. and it kinda sounded like she
didn't think I was cool either.

52
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,824
              But pah! We all
              know that's crazy.

53
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,926
     I mean, I'm definitely
      not worried

54
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,362
      about her looking up
       to somepony else.

55
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,563
             Heh. Nope.

56
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,364
              Not.

57
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,132
              At.

58
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,200
              ALL.

59
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,435
Well, I'd understand
if you were.

60
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,104
It'd be like if Apple Bloom
started lovin' bananas

61
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,172
more than apples!

62
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,874
Hahaha!

63
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,909
Y'all tell me if that
ever happens, you hear?

64
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,046
  But what could the Washouts
  possibly have that I don't?

65
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,381
         Why don't you find out?

66
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:41,419
    They're doing a show in
    Ponyville this weekend!?

67
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:48,827
Wow... they do look pretty
amazing...ly unamazing. Heh.

68
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,930
Trying so hard to look
amazing, is what I mean.

69
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,099
            NICE SAVE, TWILIGHT!

70
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,545
[groan] I knew we should have
lined up last night.

71
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,120
I'm sorry for making us late.
Who would have guessed

72
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,956
X-TREME CHOCOLATE AIR SHOW
CUPCAKES would take an...

73
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,558
x-tremely long time to bake?

74
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,967
      Look at this! It's a
      total Wonderbolts rip-off!

75
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,836
   What do you mean? The show
    hasn't even started yet!

76
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,972
     Yeah, but look at what
       we're sitting on.

                   <i>Hello!</i>

00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,877
            The Wonderbolts
             have bleachers too.

79
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,988
         We practically invented
          sitting on bleachers.

80
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,048
                          Ugh!

81
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,453
   And look at that! Popcorn
   and cotton candy? RIP-OFF!

82
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,991
             Huh!? Yeah!

                    WHOO HOO!

103
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,218
          I told you!

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,455
             I mean... [ahem] it
            was pretty cool.

105
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,724
      Who are these guys..?

106
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,566
       I can't just go up
       and TALK to them!

107
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,301
   You can if you're with me.

108
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,671
 After all, one of the reasons
there's a Rainbow Dash fan club

109
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,741
      is because I'm
       fearless. Observe.

110
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,680
   Hey!

111
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,351
Uh... so...

112
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,353
as a fellow aerobatic
professional,

113
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,689
I really enjoyed
your show.

114
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,026
 Heh, actually, you might
  recognize me since I'm a...

00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,962
 "pause for dramatic effect..."

116
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,864
         A Wonderbolt.

117
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,935
                Join the club!

118
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,839
         OK....?

119
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,476
   No, I mean literally join
   the club. We're called

120
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,778
   "The Washouts" because we
  all used to be Wonderbolts

121
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,948
     just like you... until
     we "washed out."

122
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,950
            No way!

123
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,384
                   Yep. Ah.

124
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,719
     Name's Rolling Thunder.

125
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,088
  I got booted out of
  Wonderbolt Academy cause of

126
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,058
   "flagrant disregard for
    hazardous weather." Psh.

127
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,360
 If doin' barrel rolls through
 nine-hundred million volts

128
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,729
   of electricity in a raging
   thunderstorm is wrong,

129
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,598
 then I don't want to be right.

130
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,968
Cool!

131
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,403
   Heh. This here's Short Fuse...

132
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,737
       Ah. Nice to meet you.

               a crazy idea like
               the Washouts.

146
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,950
               Or should I say
               "lack of brains."

147
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,053
You two really know each other?

148
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:46,692
  OH MY GOSH THIS IS SO COOL!

149
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,694
Your friend got me kicked
out of the Wonderbolts.

150
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,232
  Oh. That's, uh... less cool.

151
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,936
   And it was the best thing
   that ever happened to me!

152
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,404
Great to see you,
"Wing Pony!"

153
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,673
I heard you're a
full-fledged Bolt now!

154
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,642
Yeah, well,
I'm still--

155
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,543
           Mad at me?

156
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,745
       Look, was it wrong
       of me to endanger

157
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,747
       the lives of your
       friends? Yeah.

158
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,983
But hey, now I only
endanger these knuckleheads!

159
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,454
   Don't call me <i>knucklehead</i>.

160
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,826
 Come on, you know you miss me.

161
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:24,329
   Me and her? We blew
   everypony out of the sky.

162
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,964
            Really!?

163
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,802
Actually yeah, really. All that
 wind was totally dangerous.

164
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,203
     But we had fun, right?

165
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,673
       Two fastest times
       on the Dizzitron.

166
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:38,410
 If I remember correctly, I had
  you beat by half a second.

167
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:42,714
Only because when I went, I
cranked up the dizziness factor!

168
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,417
Well, I'm glad it
all worked out.

169
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,587
Your show was
pretty dynamite.

170
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,155
          Wanna know the secret?

171
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,924
    We basically ignore
   everything the Wonderbolts

172
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,826
  ever taught us about safety.

173
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,230
Well, we do have safety
rules for a reason.

174
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,783
                 Don't listen to
                 her, kid.

175
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:03,935
All their "rules" were just ways
of keeping their little club

176
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,838
  exclusive so they could
  feel good about themselves.

177
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,907
     It's not about making
     anypony feel bad,

178
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,109
       it's about finding
        the best flyers.

179
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,678
     The best of the best.

180
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,948
   I started the Washouts
   because I believe anypony

181
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,817
  can be the best of the best.

182
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:21,820
          You know...

183
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,390
    Rolling Thunder is gonna
      be out for a while...

184
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,492
         Ah! During the finale, I
         caught the ol' hind leg

185
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,830
  in the Crushinator Jaws of
  Smash-a-lot, patent pending.

186
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,966
      There's a spot on the team
      if you want to join up.

187
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,605
I appreciate the offer, but
I'm already a Wonderbolt.

188
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,374
    I'll do it! Can I do it?

189
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,710
Lemme think: no?

190
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,212
            I wasn't asking <i>you</i>.

191
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,414
                Aw, you're cute.

192
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,616
  But technically, you haven't
  "washed out" of the Bolts,

193
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,852
  which is kinda... our thing.

194
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,555
And also... "No!"

195
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,057
Oh! What if I joined and
dropped out super-quick?

196
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,992
       That's it! You're
        coming with me!

197
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,262
      Where are we going?

198
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,964
  To hear what the actual
  Wonderbolts think about you

199
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,901
     joining just to drop
     out for the Washouts.

200
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,003
   Say "hi" to Spitfire for me!

201
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,846
                   Ever seen two
                   simultaneous

202
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,483
            inverse displacement
            rolls before?

203
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,352
Pfft. Woulda been alot
cooler through the

204
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,220
Crushinator Jaws of
Smash-a-lot, patent pending.

205
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,790
                    You... What!?

206
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,526
See, this is what I
was telling you about!

207
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:35,964
                  I got this.

208
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,798
    You know what happens
   when something goes <i>wrong</i>

209
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,167
      with the Crushinator
      Jaws of Smash-a-lot?

210
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,668
            "...Patent pending?"

211
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,505
     You end up in a
  full-body-wing-and-hoof cast

212
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,374
   drinkin' through a straw!

213
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,376
  But with enough practice...

214
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,295
                    Practice!?

215
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:55,613
       Well, la-dee-<i> doodle</i> -da!

216
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,782
Let me give you a
different scenario.

217
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,217
You're probably
saying to yourself,

218
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,219
"I'm young, I'm strong.

219
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,756
I'm gonna go out there
and "stunt" some "tricks"

220
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,425
with my new friend,
Lightning Dust.

221
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,595
Well, I'm here to tell
you if you play that game,

222
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:14,299
you're gonna find out it's
pretty hard to "stunt tricks"

223
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:19,705
  in a FULL-BODY-WING-AND-HOOF
 CAST DRINKIN' THROUGH A STRAW!

224
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,406
                 I think she
                 gets the point-

225
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,174
       I'M NOT FINISHED!

226
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,611
     Listen, I get it, kid.
     I used to be like you.

227
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,781
     Tellin' myself: "I'm
     gonna touch the sky!"

228
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,716
I don't--

229
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,785
     Well,
     WHOOP-DEE-DOODLE-DOO!

230
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,421
      You think you got it
      made in the shade?

231
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,024
     Well, things are gonna
     be pretty shady indeed

232
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,193
  when you can't go out in the
    sun cause you're in

233
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:47,365
 a FULL-BODY-WING-AND-HOOF
 CAST DRINKIN' THROUGH A STRAW!

234
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,569
    DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

235
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,873
                     Excellent.
                     Have a hat.

236
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,113
Er, sorry. That was a
little... intense.

237
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,149
    I just want to make
    sure you don't get hurt.

238
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,751
    That way you can
    follow in my hoofsteps.

239
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,954
   Everypony's dream, right?

240
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,756
               More like "follow
               your wing-flaps."

241
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,824
Same difference.

242
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,361
Thanks, "super-
talented flyer,"

243
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,030
for clearing up
what <i>I</i> should do!

244
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,900
Clearing things up is
one of my specialties.

245
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,736
Now come on, let's go rip up
all your Washout posters

246
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,472
into tiny pieces and
throw 'em off a cliff.

247
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,678
   I just thought of a great
    way to raise awareness

248
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,849
  for your original fan club.
  You know, the one about me.

249
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,018
    How about a silent
    auction where every item

250
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,653
       is just a picture
        of yours truly?

251
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,655
 Haha, nahhh, I'm just kidding.

252
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,424
     That makes me seem too
    egotistical, doesn't it?

253
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,359
        OH OH! But maybe
       if they're framed,

254
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,995
   it's like, "Wow, she's so
   humble", you think?

255
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:53,765
         Scootaloo...?

256
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,134
           Er. Scootaloo?

257
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,170
    Anypony seen Scootaloo?

258
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,241
     My fault, my fault--
     sorry, I... Twilight!

259
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,345
    Sorry, I was just, um...

260
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,982
Please tell me you got that
stuff so you could rip it up

261
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,284
and throw it off a cliff.

262
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,485
  They were doing an autograph
  session before practice..

263
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,922
Seriously? Ugh.

264
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,758
You haven't seen
Scoot, have you?

265
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,426
                 Actually...

266
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,797
              I can't believe
            Scootaloo ditched me

267
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,498
         to watch them "practice"!

268
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,868
           Why can't she see how
           dangerous they are?

269
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,603
That's kind of
the whole draw.

270
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,671
It's exciting.

271
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,038
        But it's like the harder
        I try to convince Scoot

272
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,809
          they're dangerous, the
          more she likes them!

273
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,912
You can't control her
actions, only yours.

274
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:44,082
 Teach her what's safe and what
 isn't, like a good role model,

275
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,317
then hope she makes
the right decisions.

276
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,953
          But what if she
           chooses them over me?

277
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,422
           She's gonna get hurt.

278
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,057
I think I know somepony
else who might get hurt

279
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,192
if that happens.

280
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,128
      Maybe you're right.

281
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,529
    But this isn't about me.

282
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,665
 I'm just worried about Scoot.

283
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,572
Wow, you're really working
hard on this new stunt.

284
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:13,411
 WHAT KIND OF SORRY EXCUSE FOR
 A TOMATO SANDWICH IS THIS?

285
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,551
Sorry Dash, autograph
session's over.

286
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,921
Unless you want to buy
Short Fuse's limited-edition

287
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,489
half-eaten
tomato sandwich.

288
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:28,694
        I'M NOT SIGNING
       THAT ABOMINATION!

289
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,196
            You haven't seen
            Scootaloo, have you?

290
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:35,500
Oh! Isn't she that pony
that used to respect you?

291
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,704
     I'd appreciate you
     helping me find her...

292
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,707
 so I can apologize for trying
 to make her quit liking you.

293
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:47,712
  [mean laugh] Oh, I'm pretty
   sure she still likes us.

294
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,490
       Lightning Dust, I
      know we go way back,

295
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,692
        but I can't let
         her do this!

296
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,395
     I don't need <i>you</i>
      standing up for me.

297
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:08,633
Obviously you do, because you
can't see how dangerous this is.

298
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,235
      Do you not remember
      what Spitfire said?

299
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,971
       Ugh, lemme guess,

300
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,040
   "You'll be in a
  full-body-wing-and-hoof cast

301
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,777
   drinkin' through a straw!"

302
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,945
     That doesn't even
      sound like Spitfire.

303
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,981
                   That's it,
                  we're leaving!

304
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,651
Just because I
look up to you

305
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,820
doesn't mean I
have to BE you!

306
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,590
 But based on your definition
 of what makes somepony great,

307
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,160
I have bad news: I'll NEVER
be the "best of the best",

308
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:40,632
or a Wonderbolt
because I. CAN'T. FLY.

309
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,234
Is that what you wanted to hear?

310
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,404
But not being able
to fly doesn't mean

311
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,406
I can't do
something awesome,

312
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,043
like strapping my scooter to a
multi-stage liquid-fuel rocket

313
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,178
and jumping twenty
two wagons lined up

314
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,147
in front of a
roaring crowd!

315
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,182
   That was awfully specific.

316
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,186
That's cause it's what she'll
be doing in the show tonight.

317
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,489
Half-off for Princesses!
Bring your friends.

318
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,593
Scootaloo, are you sure that's
what you really want to do?

319
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,261
          Absolutely.

320
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,932
And there's <i>nothing</i>
you can do to stop me!

321
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,000
            You're right. You're
            your own foal

322
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,203
            and you have to make
            your own decisions.

323
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,139
Good. Because I already have.

324
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,376
                             Oh.

325
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,048
      I'm sorry for making
      us late again.

326
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,049
     Who would have guessed

327
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,017
   Scootaloo's Super-
    Difficult-Stunt-Special

328
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,220
   Cupcakes would have been
  so super-difficult to bake?

329
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,196
    Whoo wee, looks like all
     of Ponyville's here...

330
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,364
    except for Rainbow Dash.

331
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,799
      [Announcer]<i> And here to</i>
     <i> introduce the most</i>
    <i> dangerous stunt</i>

332
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,672
  <i> we've ever performed, it's</i>
   <i> your fearless captain...</i>

333
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:58,576
   <i> La La La Lightning Dust!</i>

334
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:08,119
  In just a moment, the newest
  member of the Washouts

335
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:12,857
  will be ROCKET-SLEDDING down
 that hill, up that ramp,

336
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:17,862
and over all twenty-two wagons,
 to land on the other side...

337
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,298
        in one piece...

338
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,466
       ..heh ...if she's lucky.

339
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:26,570
    Put your hooves together
    for HALF-PINT DYNAMITE!

340
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,675
           Whoo yeah!

341
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,099
        Lightning Dust?

342
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,150
 I have to tell you, I actually
started Equestria's first

343
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,520
      Washouts Fan Club...
       as far as I know.

344
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,923
So this is a real honor, ma'am.
Umm, do we call you ma'am?

345
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,227
  You land this jump, you can
  call me whatever you want.

346
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,933
      Wow, that sure is...

347
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,035
        Dangerous? Nahh.

348
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,669
     Well, maybe a little.

349
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,939
 Has anypony tested it before?

350
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,907
    Where's the fun in that?

351
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,314
         There's MORE?

352
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,949
     You're not thinking of
     backing out, are you?

353
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,487
  No! I'm just thinking about
   drinking through straws.

354
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,657
Are you the president
of my fan club, or not?

355
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,209
    Of course, it's just...

356
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,160
   You wouldn't want to get
   impeached for dishonoring

357
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,329
     my wishes, would you?

358
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,465
      I-- Is that a thing?

359
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,968
          Light it up!

360
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,276
     OK, now I am thinking
    about backing out!

361
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,443
                       Too late!

362
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,362
  I know I was supposed to let
  you make your own decisions,

363
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,598
   but that doesn't mean I
  can't swoop in and save you

364
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,866
       from time to time.

365
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,170
        If I'd known you
        were gonna bail,

366
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,173
       I would have done
       the trick myself!

367
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,741
Great! So you won't
mind how that rope's

368
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,110
about to coil around your hoof!

369
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,614
        Rivals for LIFE!

370
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,518
Wouldn't have it any other way.

371
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,120
I'm sorry for joining
the Washouts...

372
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,490
Lightning Dust wasn't
who I thought she was.

373
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,893
She didn't care about me being
scared or putting me in danger.

374
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:32,296
She only wanted a good show,
even if it meant I got hurt.

375
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,200
That's not the kind of
pony I wanna look up to.

376
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,502
          I'm the one who should
          be apologizing...

377
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,039
  for not acting like somepony
  who deserves a fan club.

378
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,774
          I've been lucky enough
          to have somepony

379
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,476
                  who thinks I'm
                  the coolest,

380
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,912
      but there's nothing cool
      about making you feel like

381
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,448
               you'll never be
               as awesome as me.

382
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,885
        I think we should cancel
        the Washouts Fan Club,

383
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,990
 because I know a fan club that
 could use some new members.

384
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,958
   The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!

385
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,198
       Welcome to the
       first ever meeting

386
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,134
     of the newest fan club
       for the awesomest,

387
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:14,038
  previously under-appreciated
   pony in Ponyville...

388
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,740
    with founding member and
     president Rainbow Dash

389
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:20,678
      presiding, it's the...
      Scootaloo Fan Club!

390
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,484
       You know, Rainbow
        Dash was right.

391
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:29,387
   Eavesdropping on your own
  fan club isn't weird at all.
