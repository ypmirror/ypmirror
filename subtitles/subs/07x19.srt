1
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,279
         Hmph. Looks like I'm
        not the only one

2
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:16,048
       who left Mare's Day
       to the last minute.

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,951
      There's just so many!

4
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,252
        How can I choose?

5
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:28,494
     Now hang on, everypony.
     We'll help all of you.

6
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:29,495
              HOW?

7
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,798
   Rarity: What I would do...

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,567
    ... is pick flowers that
       accentuate my mane.

9
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,603
         It makes for a
     captivating color story

10
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,872
    when you present them to
   whomever they're intended.

11
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,245
           That's it!

12
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,223
     Color consultations was
      a great idea, Rarity.

13
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,760
  Now, what can we do for you?

14
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,228
      Oh, darling, I need a
      dozen lavender pieces

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,563
    for Photo Finish's shoot

16
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,665
      on the Most Beautiful
       Manes in Equestria.

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,871
     I know you're swamped,
    but it's for Vanity Mare.

18
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,206
       She's going to take
      pictures of my mane,

19
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,275
      so color coordination
           is a must.

20
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,645
    Anything for you, Rarity.

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,051
   Have you a single big one?

22
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,153
        If the wind came
       from one direction,

23
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,690
         it would really
      intensify the effect.

24
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,692
         I don't. But I
       could make you one.

25
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,095
     It's not like I've got
      anything else to do.

26
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,302
       Hmm. I do enjoy the
        wind-swept look,

27
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:47,406
 but other ponies might need to
   see it before they feel it.

28
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,425
  My mane will be flowing over
    the chaise in the tableau

29
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:10,296
    I have in mind, but I was
   hoping to choose the color.

30
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,966
       Could you make one
        in a pale yellow?

31
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:17,236
     I need something across
   the color wheel from.. this. Heheh.

32
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,571
       Oooh. If these came
      in different colors,

33
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,841
   I'd buy one for every room.

34
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,377
   Hmm. Sales have been down...

35
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,279
       More colors it is!

36
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,254
             Pinkie?

37
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,723
       I need to put Photo
     Finish in a good mood.

38
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,826
  And nothing creates a better
    mood than your confect--

39
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,728
       Am I interrupting?

40
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,796
    We were just celebrating
         the anniversary

41
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,932
  of the twins' first sneezes!

47
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:55,400
 Ah! Pinkie, I can't have Photo
 Finish shoot my mane like this!

48
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,936
      And this party string
         won't come off!

49
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,472
     Oh, that's because it's
     not just party string;

50
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,308
        it's Super Sticky
       Celebration String!

51
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,708
   Grrrr.

52
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,414
 Sorry. I guess my sneeziversary
 was a little too sneezibratory.

53
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,585
     It'll be fine, Pinkie.

54
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,555
  I'll find a way to clean this
  up before the shoot tomorrow.

55
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,026
       Actually, you might
    consider doing the same.

56
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,738
   If only we had some kind of
  super sudsy mane conditioning

57
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,576
  shampoo for you and a magical
 cleaning remover potion for me.

58
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,746
 Oh! That's it!

59
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,848
We'll pay
a visit to Zecora!

60
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,916
She's a wonder with a cauldron.

61
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,385
I'm sure she can mix
a fix for both of us.

62
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,454
                     Huh?

63
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,923
  That's good because it would
 take forever to yank all those

64
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,026
  baked goods out of this Super
   Sticky Celebration String.

65
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,799
I.. think you may still
have some baking to do.

66
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,940
 I do wish Zecora lived in town.

67
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,509
 One shouldn't have to brave the
   darkest part of the forest

68
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,711
          for shampoo.

69
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,811
     Do you think
     Photo Finish

70
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,814
  would want to take a
   picture of my mane?

71
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,051
     Well.. mmm... I'm not sure that your
      style is quite right

72
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,787
for this particular photo essay.

73
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,822
      Photo Finish traveled
    everywhere in her search

74
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,824
          for the most
       beautiful of manes.

75
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,561
Even Yakyakistan?

76
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,663
        Well, Yaks don't
       have manes, per se

77
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,432
 and I'm not sure their style is
 quite what she's looking for either.

78
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,538
     Though, at this moment,
        neither is mine!

79
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,072
          Don't worry!

80
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,575
Zecora will absotively
be able to help!

81
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,745
     I'm sure you're right.

82
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,347
      Listen, spooky eyes!

83
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,714
          Why don't you take a picture!?
            It will last longer!

84
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,418
    On second thought, don't!

85
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,120
       Getting my picture
       taken in this state

86
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,222
  is what I'm trying to avoid!

87
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,926
  Rarity: Are you certain that's safe?

88
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,762
        <i> Zecora: I'm sure</i>
       <i> they seem strange,</i>

89
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,297
    <i> but my methods are mine.</i>

90
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,867
   <i> After all, I've been doing</i>
  <i> this for quite a long time.</i>

91
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:15,874
    I'll have those cupcakes
     cleaned off in no time!

92
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,343
You really should bake new ones.

93
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,411
              Nah!

94
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,348
   <i> For your mane, of course,</i>
       <i> just soap will do,</i>

95
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,851
 <i> so use my super sudsy shampoo.</i>

96
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,753
                  Ohhh! What a relief!

97
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,588
        I can't tell you
        how worried I was

98
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,690
    that my mane wouldn't be
      ready for the shoot.

99
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,194
        Ha ha ha ha! Oh!

100
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,696
<i>You were right to be concerned.</i>

101
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,332
<i>Manes are tricky I have learned.</i>

102
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,034
               Ohh.. pfft. Tell me about it.

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,071
<i>Cleaning is simple</i>
<i>but a magical fix,</i>

104
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:49,440
<i>could cause any number</i>
<i>of troublesome tics.</i>

105
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,509
             Really?

106
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,843
              Oooh.

107
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,247
<i>There are tales I could tell to</i>
  <i> make your hair stand on end,</i>

108
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,750
    <i> horrifying, terrifying,</i>
     <i> attempts to mane mend.</i>

109
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,353
  Well, I do enjoy a good yarn,

110
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,289
  but I'm not sure I could take
   any more mane fright today.

111
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:08,059
Well, I LOVE a
good scary story! Heh heh.

112
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,963
  <i> There's the contagious frizz</i>

              Gee, Zecora, I can
                 take a hint.

126
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,105
     <i> With just a few drops,</i>
    <i> any mess you'll improve,</i>

127
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,142
      <i> if you focus on that</i>
   <i> which you want to remove.</i>

128
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,245
It won't be hard to focus on the
Super Sticky Celebration String.

129
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,248
       It's kinda the only
       thing you can see.

130
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,218
      Zecora said it would
     only take a few drops,

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,456
   but I figured we should all
     chip in...just in case.

132
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,925
     Remember to only focus
      on the party string.

133
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,328
  We don't want to accidentally
      remove anything else.

134
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,168
          Ooooh! Sudsy!

135
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,473
 Ah! A relaxing shower really gives
     you the chance to focus

136
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,508
on the fabulousity of your mane.

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,342
             Ha ha!

138
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,582
   Not the most pleasant scent
    but it gets the job done.

139
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:50,461
   My mane feels lighter alr--
     --AIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!

140
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,004
  It's important that you know
 that I am not pointing hooves b--

141
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,439
      <i> I don't understand.</i>

142
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,040
      <i> Is that you, Rarity?</i>

143
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,676
     <i> Why would you think to</i>
    <i> point your hooves at me?</i>

144
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,278
   Let's just say I understand
        why your shampoo

145
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,980
      hasn't made a splash
       in the marketplace.

146
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,285
        Oh... Goodness, Zecora.

147
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,021
       You could at least
   pretend it isn't that bad.

148
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,890
     <i> I'm sorry my dear, but</i>
    <i> there's nothing to say.</i>

149
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,626
    <i> You just took the wrong</i>
  <i> potion from here yesterday.</i>

150
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,128
     Oh! Thank goodness!

151
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,496
  I thought maybe your shampoo
    had triggered early onset

152
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,632
     mare pattern baldness.

153
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,868
     <i> No, this lack of hair</i>
      <i> was put into motion</i>

154
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,339
   <i> when you mistakenly washed</i>
      <i> with remover potion.</i>

155
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,442
         What a relief!

156
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,145
 Well, if you could just whip up
   a cure, I'll be on my way.

157
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,247
      So much to do before
       the shoot tomorrow.

158
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,051
     <i> As I mentioned before,</i>
      <i> there's no easy fix.</i>

159
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,988
    <i> Mane mending magic's the</i>
      <i> trickiest of tricks.</i>

160
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,822
             Ooo. Sorry?

161
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,358
     <i> I doubt that your mane</i>
      <i> has left us forever,</i>

162
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,028
  <i> there's a chance we can fix</i>
 <i> it, I think, if we're clever.</i>

163
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,563
           Wa-wa-wait..

164
00:09:58,665 --> 00:09:59,931
        There's- there's a chance!?

165
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,131
           You THINK!?

166
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,469
     <i> I need to focus if I'm</i>
      <i> to work any faster,</i>

167
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,839
      <i> one wrong ingredient</i>
     <i> spells utter disaster.</i>

168
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,409
      <i> You should go finish</i>
      <i> your list of to-dos.</i>

169
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:14,045
   <i> Keep your mind off all of</i>
    <i> these mane-losing blues.</i>

170
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,888
 Oooh. There's nothing to worry about.

171
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,392
 Zecora will have a cure before
  I've even finished my to dos.

172
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:30,395
 But I don't know if I can even
 show my face looking like this.

173
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,274
     I'm sorry, miss, but I
      can't match your mane

174
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,776
       if I can't see it.

175
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,311
        What about mine?

176
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,047
Marigold, I should think.

177
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,982
     I'm sorry, but I
     believe it was my turn

178
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,117
       and I-I-I just need
          to pick up--

179
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,786
                   Perfect!

180
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,755
             Now me!

181
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,895
 It's wonderful how this display
  shows that your fans provide

182
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,097
  just the right amount of air.

183
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,433
  Well, I owe it all to Rarity.

184
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,469
         Oh, so kind of
           you to say!

185
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,371
        I-- Kindness has
     nothing to do with it.

186
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,874
   Rarity always knows how to
 make something look its best.

187
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,043
Probably because she
looks so good herself.

188
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,279
That ain't something us
non-fabulous folk here

189
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,247
can understand...

190
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,549
          Ah! Non-fabulous!?

191
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:36,127
    I appreciate everypony's
interest in our new sofa colors,

192
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,564
         but the yellow
       one is spoken for.

193
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:42,199
     Oh thank you, Davenport.
    Um, perhaps I can pick it up

194
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,233
     once everypony leav-

195
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,869
       I'll give you twice
        whatever the pony

196
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,471
      who wants to buy the
      yellow one is paying!

197
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,705
THREE TIMES!

198
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,140
            But, but, I--

199
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,074
              SOLD!

200
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,085
       I can't believe how
  differently ponies treat you

201
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,154
     when you can't command
        their attention.

202
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,923
Are you sure that's
what happened?

203
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,358
     Wait. You can't command
        ponies' attention

204
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,094
       because your mane's
           messed up?

205
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,596
           MESSED UP?

206
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,499
         Does THIS look
       "messed up" to YOU!?

207
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,105
   Honestly, how hard is it to
    pretend it's not so bad?

208
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,373
              Hard.

209
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,309
  If today is any indication of
    how ponies will treat me

210
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,913
from now on, I can't simply wait
  to see if my mane grows back.

211
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,383
       I'm sorry, Rarity.

212
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,419
      I'm sure nopony means
     to make you feel worse

213
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,620
      than you already do.

214
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,856
      Didn't you say Zecora
     was working on a cure?

215
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,226
  Yes, well, even if everypony
    isn't utterly indifferent

216
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,494
     to my presence, Zecora
        might not be able

217
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,031
     to fix THIS in time for
           the shoot!

218
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,533
    Can't you do a spell that
     restores some semblance

219
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:49,835
           of my mane!?

220
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,940
    The thing is, it's pretty
     much like Zecora said.

221
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,809
        Fixing manes with
           magic is--

222
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,477
         Tricky! I know!

223
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,478
          I don't care!

224
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,779
      Make with the tricks!

225
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:03,614
              Huh?

226
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,549
               Oh.

227
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,303
         Rarity: This won't do..

228
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,539
     I need an actual mane!

229
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,641
But it has to come
from somewhere.

230
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,677
      Huh. You can't just make
       a mane with magic,

231
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,646
        the results could
         be disastrous.

232
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,814
More disastrous than this!?

233
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:53,932
Ohh.. I don't think there's
anything else we can try.

234
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,969
   But we- But Zecora said there
      was still a chance...

   <i> I've searched for so long.</i>

236
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,342

       <i> was totally wrong.</i>

237
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,711
Zecora, you found a cure?

238
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:07,946
That's amazing!

239
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,816
  Oh! You mean I'll get my fabulous
mane back in time for the shoot?

240
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,618
             Oh. No.

Uh-uh.

246
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,004
I think we can both say
that's not a good option.

247
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,214
 I have always believed that the
  right outfit can make up for

248

        any other areas
        that are lacking,

249
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,618
      but I will need your
        honest opinions.

A-ha...!

251

255
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,799

 Maybe....

Well, if any of you have an idea

265
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,330
        How is milking a

         That's just it.

It looks like we hired
a new milk maid.

268

   This is pretty close to my
       color as a youngun.

269
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,010
       Just a little down

                     Heh heh...huh.

273
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,626
         This'll do the
      trick, just you wait.

274
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:09,801
    [gasp] You know, this is really
        quite fetching--

275
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,869
                 Yes! Nailed it!

276
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,274
      --just not portable.

277
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:24,315
             There.

278
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,220
       Oh, let's face it.

279
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,189
     I'll just have to call
    Photo Finish and cancel.

280
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,929
   I think we all know how
   bad Rarity's been feeling,

281
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,199
but I never thought she'd cancel
  her shoot with Photo Finish.

282
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,201
You saw her mane, right?

283
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:44,969
But it's Rarity.

284
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,206
If anypony can turn lemons
into lemonade, it's her.

285
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,609
   I guess it's harder for her
 when she feels like the lemon.

286
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,378
        Well, she's not a
     lemon. She's our friend

287
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,280
        and right now she
       needs our support.

288
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,052
        Rarity: Come in.

289
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:05,523
Would you mind closing the door?

290
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,592
      I'm more comfortable
          in the dark.

291
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,731
     OK, Rarity, you've done
   just about enough sulkin'.

292
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,866
     Having a fabulous mane
      is a wonderful thing,

293
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,535
  but it ain't the only thing.

294
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,403
     Yeah!

295
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,172
    And we're here to remind
    you how awesome you are,

296
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,041
        mane or no mane!

297
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,810
         [sigh] It's lovely of
           you to say,

298
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,980
     but it's hard to argue
     with cold. Hard. Facts.

299
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,650
      What facts are those?

300
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:35,353
 That without my mane, I simply
    can't shine as I once did

301
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:39,358
  and ponies treat me like the
sad, invisible pony I've become.

302
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,727
Rarity, you're not invisible.

303
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,195
You're our friend.

304
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,631
A friend who started
a fashion empire.

305
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,766
A friend who made us
all feel beautiful

306
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,635
    in her lovely creations.

307
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,371
       A friend who stuck
      by us no matter what.

308
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:57,207
  A friend so generous that she
  once chopped off her own tail

309
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,810
     to help a sea serpent!

310
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,713
 I know you lost some confidence
    when you lost your mane,

311
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,049
      but unlike your hair,
     confidence is something

312
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,817
   you can get back right now.

313
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,021
         Goodness, you're right!

314
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,191
        The only pony behaving
       differently today was me!

315
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,994
         Besides, one doesn't
      shine from the outside in.

316
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,700
 Um, Rarity, what are you doing?

317
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:26,538
     I'm preparing to shine
      from the inside out.

318
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,573
  Awesome!

319
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,278
       It's my own fault.

320
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,081
 I shouldn't have bought flowers
     without asking Spoiled

321
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,449
         what she likes.

322
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,285
 Well, we don't have much left.

323
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,853
       What does she like?

324
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,789
           Um, purple?

325
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,524
   Rarity: I have a solution.

326
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,697
 Rarity, that mane is-- Amazing!

327
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:57,035
Thank you, although I'm afraid I
missed my chance at Vanity Mare.

328
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:01,606
 Which means I have quite a few
 lavender arrangements to spare.

329
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,508
Uh... Is lavender purple?

330
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,417
       Hm. The wind-swept look
      is very last season.

331
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,053
        Perhaps you could
      set this up outside?

332
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,088
        It's sure to draw
      in the hoof traffic?

333
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,868
Photo shoot or no, you
can always use a chaise.

334
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,705
   Well, Rarity, if you wanted
  to shine from the inside out,

335
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,042
   I think this afternoon, you
   became the brightest filly

336
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,410
          in Equestria.

337
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,913
Oh, pshaw, Applejack, I'm simply
   making up for all the time

338
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,483
        I wasted feeling
        sorry for myself.

339
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:49,887
  I don't know why you were so
 upset, your mane looks awesome!

340
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,690
  I'm just glad that I have all
    of you to remind me that

341
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,660
   even if I accidentally use
     magical remover potion

342
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,362
     on my mane, I can look
       good on the outside

343
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,831
     as long as I feel good
         on the inside.

344
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,035
How did you end up using remover
potion on your head anyway?

345
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,838
             [gasp] Pinkie!

346
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,607
      If I had the remover
     potion this whole time,

347
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,742
        that means Pinkie
         must have the--

348
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,479
        WHHHEEEEEEEEE!!! [giggling]

349
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,080
            Shampoo.

350
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,348
Shampoo?

351
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,151
Wow, that explains why our manes
   are all so bouncy and soft.

352
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,626
   Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the
  rest of that remover potion.

353
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:29,595
             Great!

354
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,598
Hey! Is there something
different about you?

355
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,065
New hoof polish?

356
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,136
         So you're sure?

357
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,970
        You're sure it's
        fully recovered.

358
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,106
 Yes, Rarity, it's been months.

359
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,074
      Your mane looks fine.

360
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,146
          Ooooh, look!

361
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,849
It's the Most Beautiful Manes In
 Equestria issue of Vanity Mare.

362
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,284
You should read it.

363
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,787
         Oh, honestly, Pinkie,
       after all I went through,

364
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,824
    I'm not sure it even matters
     what mane graces the pag--

365
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:00,992
READ IT!

366
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,596
    But.. I canceled the shoot.

367
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,666
      We had a little talk
       with Photo Finish.

368
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,902
And explained just how beautiful
      we thought you were -

369
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,772
                 inside and out.

370
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,107
     While you were shining
      from the inside out,

371
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,944
        Photo Finish took
         a few pictures.

372
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,648
    I don't know what to say.

373
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,350
Luckily, you don't
have to say anything.

374
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,053
Your style speaks for itself.
