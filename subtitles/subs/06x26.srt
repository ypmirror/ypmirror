1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,065
<i> It's the ponies</i>
<i> from my old village.</i>

2
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,130
Oh! It's only a dream.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,780
With my past, I should never
be in charge of anything.

4
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:19,145
THEY'VE TAKEN MY SISTER AND I!
IT'S WORSE THAN LAST TIME!

5
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:21,335
Chrysalis and the
Changelings are back.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,740
They've ponynapped all of
the most powerful ponies

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,780
in Equestria.

8
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:28,100
This is Thorax. He's
a reformed Changeling.

9
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:29,900
They took Fluttershy?

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,510
I think I have a pretty good
idea where she might be.

12
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:23,720
Oh, this is so strange.
We're here and that's there

13
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:27,200
and I clearly meant for us
to be there and not here.

14
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,565
Oh, I can probably
explain that.

15
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:31,915
Oh well, if at first
you don't succeed.

16
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:35,200
Maybe we should come
up with a plan first?

17
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:36,655
A what?

18
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:39,390
You know, figuring out the
best way to do something

19
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,845
before you actually do it?

20
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,600
Oh, that's adorable.

21
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,635
But, you see, unlike
you I can do anything.

22
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:48,625
Actually...

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,385
That's all very nice, but
really a waste of time.

24
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,835
We have me.

25
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:55,265
And what else could
we possibly need?

26
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:59,640
A draconequis with magic AND
half a brain might help.

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,445
Why are you here
again?

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,605
I mean, it's not like you're
going to stop the Changelings

29
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,590
by pulling a rabbit
out of the hat.

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,365
At least my magic
can do something.

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,245
The thing about
magic here is...

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,950
Like this!

33
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,175
For Fluttershy!

34
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:17,100
Eeyah!

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,960
I've been trying to tell you.

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,850
Nothing other than
Changeling magic works here!

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,395
Chrysalis' throne is carved
from an ancient dark stone

38
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:33,200
that soaks up outside magic
the same way Changelings

39
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,295
soak up love. It's how
she keeps the hive safe.

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,325
So... What kind of
plan were you thinking?

41
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:50,710
Without magic I have no idea.
But nopony else is coming,

42
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:52,970
so somepony better
come up with something.

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,550
Anypony?

44
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,235
<i> Anything?</i>

45
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,035
Hmmm.

46
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:03,770
This throne. If we get into
the hive and destroy it,

47
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,170
can we get our magic back?

48
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:06,020
Uh-huh.

49
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,785
Well, that's a terrible plan.

50
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,540
How are we even supposed
to get to the hive?

51
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,460
We walk?

52
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,010
I haven't walked that
far in millennia.

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,550
Ugh.

54
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,580
Ugh. I don't know how any
of you manage not being able

55
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,990
to disappear and reappear
whenever you want.

56
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:34,630
Well, I for one definitely miss
you being able to disappear.

57
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:36,695
Give Discord a break.

58
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,495
None of us knew we weren't
going to be able to use magic.

59
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:40,640
I did.

60
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:43,650
If we get separated, it might
make sense to have a way

61
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,745
to make sure we are
who we say we are.

62
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,125
Ooo. Like a secret code.
How about if I say "We are"

63
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:56,405
you say "Doomed?" Or you say
"Rescue" and I say "I'm--

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,540
How about if we say "Klutzy"
and you say "Draconequis?"

65
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,490
Klutzy draconequis.
Works for me.

66
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,280
I'll definitely
remember it.

67
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,600
<i>OK. I am definitely</i>
<i>glad you came.</i>

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,285
I don't think we'd be able
to find our way without you.

69
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,945
You definitely wouldn't.

70
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:30,365
Um... Where's the way out?

71
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:33,920
It's a Changeling Hive. It
shifts and changes like we do

72
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:36,155
and we're the only ones
who can navigate it.

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,360
It's total chaos to
non-Changelings.

74
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,280
Well, it's decent chaos. I don't
know if I'd call it total.

75
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,325
Are we sure that
I'll get my magic back

76
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,875
when we destroy
this throne-thingy?

77
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,790
If Thorax is
right, then yes.

78
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,110
Well, that's reassuring.

79
00:04:56,465 --> 00:04:58,320
And how are we supposed
to destroy the throne

80
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,335
when we find it?

81
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,740
I... don't know.

82
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,650
That's reassuring.

83
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,435
I don't suppose you brought
any throne-destroying tools

84
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,340
along with these
useless side show props?

85
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:15,795
Asks the "lord of chaos"
who can't go for a walk

86
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,725
without whining non-stop.

87
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:20,225
Yes, but when the
throne is destroyed,

88
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:23,395
I'LL be able to rip the
very fabric of reality

89
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,260
to save our friends
while YOU'LL still be

90
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,510
a self-absorbed,
below-average illusionist.

91
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:33,640
SELF-ABSORBED?! Why you--

92
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,935
CUT! IT! OUT!

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm just barely
keeping it together

94
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,695
and it would be WONDERFUL if you
two could actually try to help

95
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,720
instead of bickering like foals.

96
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,240
OK.

97
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:47,535
How can we help?

98
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:50,655
Don't ask me! I couldn't
even handle giving advice

99
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,755
at the Sunset Festival
and I HAD magic then!

100
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,030
And the three of us
are as good as useless.

101
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,530
At least Thorax knows
where we're going.

102
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,395
<i>Um... guys?</i>

103
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,290
I think we're lost.

104
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:04,290
<i> Aww, great!</i>

105
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:06,710
We might as well just
sit here and wait

106
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:09,620
for the Changelings to
soak up all of our love

107
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:12,565
or whatever gross thing
it is that they do.

108
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,170
How often do you
all get hungry?

109
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,205
Actually, I haven't
been since I met Spike.

110
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,580
And Changelings
are always hungry.

111
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,460
We can never get
enough love.

112
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,495
Well, that's just super.

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,490
But you aren't
hungry at all now?

114
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,470
Once I made a few friends,
I guess I just sort of...

115
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,085
forgot about the
whole feeding thing.

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,600
Is that about the same
time your wings changed?

117
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,390
I guess so.

118
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:44,410
While I would love to
sit around chit-chatting

119
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:46,625
about feeding and
not feeding.

120
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,245
I have a FLUTTERSHY to save!

121
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,040
Can you please lower your voice?

122
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,945
You're going to get
us all captured!

123
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,270
Oh! You keep saying
that, but I haven't seen

124
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:05,405
an actual Changeling since
we got into this hive.

125
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,295
What's that!?

126
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,495
A CHANGELING PATROL!

127
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:23,935
This seems like one of those
moments where we need a plan.

128
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,515
What kind of plan?

129
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,680
We have no magic

130
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:29,325
and it's not like my illusions
are going to save us.

131
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,610
Do you have any of
your smoke bombs?

132
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,985
Are you kidding?

133
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,685
Looking for somepony?

134
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,815
Is that the best
you've got? Hahaha!

135
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:58,035
Not exactly Great and
Powerful, but effective.

136
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,285
Mh, I'll take it.

137
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,800
Klutzy...

138
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,475
Draconequis.

139
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:09,740
I really think we
need a new code word.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,655
That was a pretty
good plan.

141
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:13,990
But we still don't
know where we're going.

142
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,480
<i> Actually, we might.</i>

143
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:18,070
Two of the Changelings
didn't go with the rest.

144
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,910
Oh! With an intruder
in the hive,

145
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,895
they went to
protect the Queen.

146
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:24,830
Good thinking,
Starlight!

147
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,705
Now what?

148
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,935
We go in.

149
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,525
Even if I wanted to, there's
no way past the guards.

150
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:49,190
We'll be spotted for sure.

151
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,940
We need some kind
of distraction.

152
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,055
I'm fresh out of
smoke bombs.

153
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,440
Normally I'm the most
distracting thing

154
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,895
I can think of, but
without magic...

155
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:01,920
You shouldn't
underestimate yourself.

156
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:12,030
Hello, Changelings and
Changelettes, believe me;

157
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,525
I was just as surprised
as you are that I'm here.

158
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:17,520
When I heard that I'd be playing
for a bunch of Changelings,

159
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:21,955
I was beside myself. Then I
realized it was just one of you.

160
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,460
But seriously, this
isn't the toughest crowd

161
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:27,635
I've ever been in front of,

162
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,515
but it's definitely
the easiest to bug.

163
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,175
To bug...

164
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,800
Is this thing on?

165
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,485
Well, if you think that
you can do any better,

166
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,105
be my guest!

167
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,915
It is absolutely ridiculous
that that worked.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,180
It is certainly a pleasure
to have such dedicated fans.

169
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:58,970
I'll have to come back
with some new material

170
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:00,945
after I rescue Fluttershy.

171
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,025
<i> Please... Help...</i>

172
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,040
Fluttershy!

173
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,825
Discord! I'm stuck!

174
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,280
You certainly are.

175
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,035
And I should probably
help you get free, but...

176
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:16,725
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

177
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,190
But what?

178
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:21,685
But you are obviously
not Fluttershy.

179
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,015
Oh.

180
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,915
I mean, I'm separated
from the group

181
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,995
and just happen to come across
the one pony I care most about?

182
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,585
I can smell this
set-up a mile away.

183
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,770
No. You're right.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,255
There's no way you
should trust me.

185
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:43,355
Just go find the
others. I understand.

186
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,240
Oh, come on.

187
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,540
We're probably
all Changelings.

188
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:55,615
You shouldn't
rescue any of us.

189
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,485
Unless you think maybe one of us
might be the real Fluttershy.

190
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:05,065
That certainly would be a nasty
Changeling trick, wouldn't it?

191
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:06,980
I'm the real one.

192
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm the real one.

193
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:11,830
I'm the real
Fluttershy.

194
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,935
We can't wait for Discord.
Between seeing him and Trixie,

195
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,640
the castle will be
crawling with guards soon.

196
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,085
But if we do manage to
destroy Chrysalis' throne,

197
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,045
we'll need him.

198
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,995
He could take on the
entire Changeling army

199
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,635
by sneezing if he
wanted to.

200
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,375
He's probably already
been captured.

201
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,930
Hello? Fellow rescuers?

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,275
We can't stay here. We've
got to find the throne!

203
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,985
Oooh! I heard some
of the Changelings

204
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:47,395
who were chasing me say
that they know where it is.

205
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,305
Klutzy...

206
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:55,540
Hmmmm? Oh, yeah haha. I can
be klutzy. Now, follow me!

207
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,950
You know that's
not Discord, right?

208
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,440
Obviously.

209
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:04,680
This way! We're
almost there!

210
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,680
I know this trick. If
he says to go left,

211
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,470
we should definitely go right.

212
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:11,885
He's leading us to a
swarm waiting to attack.

213
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,510
OK, I'll handle it.

214
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,140
You two just get ready to
run into the other tunnel.

215
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,725
Wait, what!? Trixie
you can't.

216
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,670
I won't know what to do.
We've already lost Discord.

217
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,005
I can't lose you too.
Without magic I--

218
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,315
Starlight, you got us this
far with just my illusions

219
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,565
and Discord's
annoying personality.

220
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:35,575
You don't need magic to
figure out what to do next.

221
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,905
I know you're afraid
to be in charge,

222
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,660
but you're really good at it.
Listen to your best friend.

223
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:48,450
Hey, Discord? Wanna see the new
trick I've been working on?

224
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:52,820
I call it, "The
Changeling Catcher!"

225
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:55,195
Run!

226
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:49,115
One little pony
all by herself.

227
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:56,335
Oh, how will I ever
prevent this daring rescue?

228
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:13,265
Well, well, well. The Princess
of Friendship's sole pupil.

229
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:16,895
Honestly, I didn't think
you were worth replacing

230
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,460
with one of my drones.

231
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,715
You won't get away with this!

232
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,960
I already have. Nopony
is coming to save you.

233
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,945
Your little squad was it,
and now there's just you.

234
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:33,890
Thorax is still out there.

235
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,430
Don't mention that traitor's
name in my Kingdom!

236
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,160
He was a fool to leave and
even more a fool to return.

237
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,565
When I find him he'll
learn just what happens

238
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,830
to those who betray the hive.

239
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,095
And it seems I don't
have far to look, do I.

240
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:56,520
Thorax!

241
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,055
Very clever. And clearly Thorax
revealed to you the secret

242
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,670
of my throne. I can't
have powerful ponies

243
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,640
using their
abilities against me.

244
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:18,080
Even with your
rather embarrassing

245
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:20,920
little rescue attempt,
everything has gone

246
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:23,270
according to MY plan.

247
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:26,405
What plan? Why did
you do all this?

248
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,410
So I could feed, of course!

249
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:32,375
By replacing the most beloved
figures in Equestria,

250
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:36,040
my drones will be able to store
all the love meant for them

251
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:38,590
and return it here... to me.

252
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:43,225
Everypony will do as I
command and my subjects

253
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:50,130
and I will feed on their love
for generations!

254
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,600
What if you
didn't have to?

255
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,715
Ridiculous!

256
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,285
The hunger of Changelings
can never be satisfied.

257
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,645
Exactly. Thorax left the
hive and made a friend.

258
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,320
He shared love and now
he doesn't need to feed!

259
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,530
You don't have to live your
lives starving all the time!

260
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,835
You know nothing
of the Changelings

261
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,890
or what it takes
to be their Queen!

262
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,155
I decide what is best for my
subjects, not some mewling grub!

263
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,875
I know what it's like to lead
by fear and intimidation.

264
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:29,510
And I know
what it's like

265
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:32,015
to want everypony
to do what you say.

266
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:36,125
But I was wrong. A real leader
doesn't force her subjects

267
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,910
to deny who they are.

268
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,505
She celebrates what
makes them unique...

269
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,295
...and listens when one of
them finds a better way.

270
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:46,515
The only thing
Thorax has found...

271
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,125
...is what happens to those who
turn their back on the hive!

272
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,855
No! Stop!

273
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:57,485
Just as soon as I drain every
last ounce of love from him

274
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:00,875
and show my subjects
what a real leader is.

275
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:05,655
I can feel the love
inside me slipping away.

276
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,225
I can't hold onto
it much longer.

277
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,185
Then don't!

278
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,875
Sharing love is what made
you different to begin with.

279
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:15,260
You should share
yours with Chrysalis.

280
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,100
Give her all of it.

281
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:41,020
This is what happens
when you give love freely

282
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,630
instead of taking it.

283
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,135
Fluttershy?

284
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,165
It's, um, good to see you too.

285
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,740
Starlight?

286
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,695
What happened?

287
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,825
We defeated the Changelings
with no magic at all;

288
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,455
they found a new leader...

289
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,215
and they're all
kinda good now.

290
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:41,090
Well done, Starlight Glimmer.

291
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,930
It seems as though you've
learned a great deal

292
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:44,245
since we last spoke.

293
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:56,170
When Twilight and her
friends defeated me,

294
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,245
I chose to run away and seek
revenge. You don't have to.

295
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:03,215
You can be the leader
your subjects deserve.

296
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:13,275
There is no revenge you
could ever conceive of

297
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:15,850
that will come close to
what I will exact upon you

298
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,555
one day, Starlight Glimmer!

299
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,755
Thorax, as the new leader
of the Changelings,

300
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,925
I look forward to discussing how
we can improve our relationship

301
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,945
in the future.

302
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,590
However, for the moment,
perhaps it is best

303
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,460
that we leave the Changeling
Kingdom to the Changelings.

304
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:45,415
Splendid idea!
Now who's ready

305
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,245
for some celebratory
tea at Fluttershy's?

306
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,045
Oh. Um. Everypony?

307
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:55,355
Actually, now that you
can snap your claws

308
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,455
and send us absolutely
anywhere again,

309
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,730
I think I have a
better option.

310
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,270
Uh.. Hey Starlight.
What are you doing here?

311
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,450
You left in such
a hurry before,

312
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,840
we kinda thought you
didn't want to come.

313
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:15,005
Yeah. I guess after the way I
used my magic on all of you,

314
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,405
I wasn't sure I was somepony
who should even be in charge

315
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:20,645
of a baking contest. I was
afraid I might go back

316
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,950
to being the pony I
used to be. But...

317
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,935
...I realized that sometimes
you don't have a choice.

318
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:32,090
You have to step up. And I
HAVE changed. I can handle it.

319
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:34,855
Whether than means saving
Equestria OR helping friends

320
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:38,370
with a sunset festival.
Speaking of which...

321
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:42,370
...I know the festival is almost
over, but I kinda invited

322
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:44,745
a few of my
friends to join.

323
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,690
Hope that's OK.

324
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:51,885
Are you kidding? Of course!

325
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:55,100
Great. Now, where's
that baking contest?

326
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,350
This pony needs a cupcake!

327
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,830
So I'm able to rip the very
fabric of reality again.

328
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,920
Yeah, yeah and I'm
still a self-absorbed,

329
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,200
below-average
illusionist. Right?

330
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,400
Actually, I was going to say
a COUPLE of those illusions

331
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,610
were slightly above average.

332
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,330
If you ever need a little chaos
in your act, let me know.

333
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,865
Ha! When pigs fly!

334
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,965
Your wish is my command!

335
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:30,585
Whoa-whoaaaa!

336
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,905
Somepony is really gonna have to
catch us up on what we missed.
