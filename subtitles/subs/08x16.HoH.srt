   I wish I had known it too.

421
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,836
 Thanks for returning our bits,

422
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,106
  but how are we going to
  learn about friendship now?

423
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,943
     [disappointed murmurs]

424
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:49,380
   Well, I can refer you to a
 fairly reputable establishment

425
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,349
   just outside of Ponyville.

426
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:55,453
 I'm quite certain the headmare
 would consider letting you in.

427
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:56,788
      [giggled agreement]

428
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,890
            [cheers]

429
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,759
     "Of course, if I ever
     go to a school again,

430
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:05,696
   I'll make sure it's yours.
   In friendship, Starswirl."

431
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,865
    I still don't understand
    how Flim and Flam

432
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,701
     could have gotten
      a copy of your book.

433
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,870
   Uh. I finished straightening
     up in the library.

434
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,406
    Professor Rarity, I just
     wanted to make sure

435
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,408
       you're definitely
        keeping these.

436
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,010
    But of course, darling.

437
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,411
 If there's one thing I learned
 at Friendship University,

438
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,748
   it is not to give up when
   you know what's right

439
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,485
 and I know teaching friendship
 through sewing is right!

440
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,421
 I just need to figure out how...
