00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,102
                  Of course.

282
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,553
     So when you pony-napped
    Twilight and the others,

283
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,855
       you cocooned them.

284
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,358
       Yes. Until that sow
        Starlight Glimmer

285
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,396
  freed them, corrupted my
  subjects, and stole my hive!

286
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,598
  Those ponies have weaknesses.

287
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,167
  I used that turncoat Discord.

288
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,569
      Tricked him into
     helping me capture his

289
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,705
      so called "friends".

290
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:45,276
  Ah. Discord was really something
  until friendship ruined him.

291
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,678
       You should've seen
       Twilight's face

292
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,515
    when her friends appeared
      in bubbles around me.

293
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,349
         She was all...

294
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,558
She's SO stressed
out all the time!

295
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,327
             When I posed as her
             former foal-sitter,

296
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,696
               I thought she was
               going to implode!

297
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,234
        I wish I could
       have seen her face

298
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,471
    when I nearly erased all
    the magic from Equestria...

299
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:17,375
    ALL magic was a little
   excessive, don't you think?

300
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,609
               Meh. I think big.

301
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,079
      Besides, it would've
      been worth it

302
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,916
  just to see Twilight and
   her friends bow down to ME.

303
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:28,686
      Indeed, it would. Who
      wouldn't love to see

304
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:32,490
   those prissy ponies realize
   they've lost everything!

305
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,260
  I'm a pathetic pony princess!

306
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:40,665
    I made a detailed list of
   all the ways I'm a failure!

307
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,737
 You know, working with you two

308
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,074
   may not be the worst thing.

309
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:52,143
Mm. Perhaps... as long as it results

310
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,813
    in the complete
   destruction of our enemies.

311
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,548
        I wouldn't have
        it any other way.

312
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,450
      Do the "pathetic
      princess" thing again!

313
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,202
             I'm OK!

314
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:26,911
               ♪♪

315
00:17:28,748 --> 00:18:01,623
♪♪

316
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,951
           [zap] Wah!

317
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,789
        [zap] Uh!

318
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,558
Can you absorb it
and make it go away?

319
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,695
     I can only absorb magic
      from living beings.

320
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,763
Like her..?

321
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,698
            Betrayal!

322
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,201
     Not betrayal. Teamwork.

323
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,269
  If Tirek absorbs your energy,

324
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,638
   he might be strong
    enough to break through.

325
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,073
            And then..?

326
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,109
Then... he
gives it back.

327
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,543
                   I do?

328
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,412
     Mhm!

329
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,880
  How do I know you won't
   take my magic and leave me?

330
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,218
                    Would we do
                    that to you?

331
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,353
                  OK. Normally
                  yes, we would.

332
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,389
                I'll give you
                your magic back...

333
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,325
      Do it.

334
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,804
        So. Much. Power!

335
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,541
       Welcome back, baby!

336
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,178
   It's not big enough for me!

337
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,714
Maybe not you.

338
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,984
      Keep it open or I'll
       be trapped forever!

339
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,220
Would that be so terrible?

340
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:23,494
 Can't... hold.... much longer!

341
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,464
             HURRY!

342
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,036
             Ta-da!

343
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,071
            My magic...

344
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,315
    I... wasn't sure you were
     going to give it back.

345
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,618
   Neither was I. But working
    together seemed...

346
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,555
      smarter than to
       continue fighting.

347
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,391
When we helped each other,
it felt better somehow.

348
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:57,328
  I haven't felt like this
  since before I lost my hive.

349
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,630
     Having others who will
     be there for you...

350
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,666
          is pleasing.

351
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:07,171
    All of these years...
    taking power from ponies.

352
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,907
     When you use your
      power to help others...

353
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,443
        Yes.... it feels....

354
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,144
     NO!

355
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:14,979
                Whoa!

356
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,217
     The magic of <i>friendship</i>
     is like a disease.

357
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,953
    An infection that spreads
     to those around you!

358
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,322
         I watched it
         infect my hive.

359
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,390
    I will NOT let it get ME!

360
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,258
   Same!

361
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,459
                  Obviously.

362
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,996
     But... Grogar said we
     have to work together.

363
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,432
     Grogar is too powerful.

364
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,901
        Something must be
        done about that...

365
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,105
     Let Grogar think we're
     his loyal servants.

366
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:45,043
     In the meantime, we'll
      hatch our own plan.

367
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:48,579
Ooo. I love a good
backstabbing!

368
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,414
After that, we can go back

369
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,883
to trying to..
destroy each other.

370
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,453
      In the meantime, what
       do we do with this?

371
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,258
       You failed to
       retrieve the BELL?

372
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,427
                We're sorry,
                Almighty Grogar.

373
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,997
       We worked together
       as you asked!

374
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,599
We just aren't as
powerful as you!

375
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,806
           Obviously!

376
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,108
            At least you finally
            did as you were told

377
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,609
            and worked together.

378
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:20,979
   Of course!

379
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,847
      Whatever you command.

380
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,849
Forget about
that old bell.

381
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,719
You were right!

382
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,888
We're SO much more powerful
when we work as a team...
