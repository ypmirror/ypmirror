430
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,388
       or you'll be stuck
       here forever,

431
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,292
because we're out of magic keys
and nopony can open the door?

432
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,627
              Ohh, dear. I hadn't
              thought of that.

433
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,697
       We're just as
       trapped as Tirek?

434
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,499
        Ha ha ha ha ha.

435
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,867
          What a pity.

436
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,635
         Well, for you.

437
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,971
     Sweet revenge for me.

438
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,610
 It seems my little protégé's
 plan worked after all.

439
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:40,911
           [all gasp]

440
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,446
     Which little protégé?

441
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,782
Oh, we've never met.

442
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:45,883
We're pen pals.

443
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:50,655
Each letter had so many
questions about draining magic.

444
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,023
          And you answered them!?

445
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,525
Well, I was bored.

446
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,362
So I simply pointed my pen
pal in the right direction.

447
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,497
             [thud]

448
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,933
     Can't you just tell us
      your pen pal's name?

449
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,704
      I mean, since we're
      stuck here anyway...

450
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,539
          Oh, why not.

451
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,242
   The irony is too perfect.

452
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,245
         Her name is...

453
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,714
           Cozy Glow!

454
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,516
     I could've sworn I saw
     her come down this way

455
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,050
   when she left her office.

456
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,089
             [gasp]

457
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,229
     Enjoying yourself
      in there, Starlight?

458
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:35,966
 I'm sorry I had to push you
 in, but what else could I do?

459
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:40,138
       You were going to
       ruin all my plans.

460
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,840
             [gasp]

461
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,975
You might get some company soon,

462
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,912
   if I can't make that
  annoying Neighsay BACK OFF.

463
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,151
  All this magic needs time to
   drain from Equestria

464
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,087
     before my vortex sucks
      it to another realm!

465
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,422
            [giggle]

466
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,192
    Three days can sure
    seem like forever, huh?

467
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,829
      You know, you ponies
       got it all wrong.

468
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,031
    Friendship isn't <i>magic.</i>

469
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,166
      Friendship is POWER!

470
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,437
     With Twilight and her
     lackies out of my way,

471
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,308
       all of Equestria
       will bow to me...

472
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,445
       The future EMPRESS
       OF FRIENDSHIP!

473
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:29,818
    [evil laugh building to
      shrieking laughter]
