281
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,844
         What? No way!

282
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:33,945
     Why would I say that?

283
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,880
        You already live
         in Ponyville.

284
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,116
    Staying here over
     break is no big deal.

285
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,921
School of Friendship good place
 for pony to have pony holiday.

286
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,657
I'd still rather spend it
with my family at home.

287
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,325
      Oh! That reminds me!

288
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,228
     I have the BEST
      holiday story ever!

289
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,232
    It's called "The Day My
     Hearth's Warming Doll

00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,701
  Almost Fell into the Fire!"

295
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,080
        <i> But THIS year...</i>

296
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,317
    <i> I put my doll too close</i>
    <i> to the edge and it FELL!</i>

00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,187
           [slowly] NOOOOOOO!

298
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,192
                         And!?

299
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,761
     My doll hit the floor.

300
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,130
       BUT! It could have
       gone in the fire!

301
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,666
That's a great story.

302
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,168
And you told it
 really well.

303
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,138
    Yeah. It was a Hearth's
     Warming miracle!

       [door opens]

305
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,739
                Next!

306
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,375
Smolder, come with me.

307
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,610
Yona, Twilight's
waiting for you.

             [slam]

309
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,516
         The last two.

310
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,720
   So if neither one of them
    confesses, that means...

311
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,422
    We're never going home!

312
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,595
     We'll be here forever!

313
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,397
Beyond forever.

314
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,701
But I can't miss the Three
Days of Freedom Celebration!

315
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,037
    How long does that last?

316
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,974
It used to be only ONE day, but
 now to commemorate our escape

317
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:14,279
from the Storm King,
we're adding two more
days of awesome!

318
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,214
              See!

319
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,182
        There's a book?

320
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,385
  Mm hm! Queen Novo had these
 made for the Mt. Aris

        What are those?

340
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,448
       Your aunt's and
       uncle's children?

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,184
 You know, part of your family.

342
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,587
             Heh. Oh, you're teasing
              us again, right?

343
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,759
     I'm guessing neither
     one of you confessed.

Headmare Twilight
 say wait here.

346
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,899
  Maybe they're changing their
  minds about sending us home.

347
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:41,933
Why would they?

348
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,035
Face it. We're stuck here.

349
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,238
 But, but, I
HAVE to go home!

350
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,141
My mom makes the
best kelp fritters.

351
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,944
       How can you be so
        cool about this?

352
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,746
We're mad.

353
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,181
We just show it
differently.

354
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,316
           More like you don't
               show it at all.

355

What pony getting at?

356
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,388
       Maybe it wasn't
      just one prankster.

357
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,323
        Maybe there were
         three of you!

358
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,860
 And you're trying to hide
 your guilt by not being upset!

359
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,196
            It does make sense..

         Guys, stop it.

361
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,535
   Or maybe whoever did it is
  only pretending to be upset.

362
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,703
        To throw us off.

      That's not what the
      holidays are about.

   No matter what you call
  them, or how you celebrate.

372
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,601
        Do you know how
       lucky you all are?

373
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,971
    With your stories about
     sharing, and kindness,

       with everycreature

     But... Griffons do
     that too, don't they?

377
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,414
Some holiday
about a moon?

378
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:05,016
           [sigh] Blue Moon Festival.

379
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,052
The one time of year
when Griffons are nice to each other.

380
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,521
  Well, as nice as we can be.

00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,700
    Well, at least you get
    to be with your family!

385
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,602
             No...

386
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,870
 Because I don't have a family.

00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,944
             Why would you ruin
              things for us?

401
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,979
       I didn't plan to!

402
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,647
      I just figured if I
      made a mess,

403
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,816
    our teachers would make
    us stay to clean up.

404
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,118
        We'd be together
        a little longer.

00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,554
  Well. It worked, didn't it?

406
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,122
Better than I thought.

407
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,891
When Headmare Twilight
threatened to cancel

408
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,328
 winter break, that
meant I would get to
be with all of you,

409
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,363
  through the entire holiday!

410
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,065
  That's why I didn't confess.

411
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,934
       So why are you
      admitting this now?

412
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,772
I hated seeing all you fighting
 and blaming each other.

413
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,708
  That's the opposite of what
  ALL your holidays mean.

414
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,643
  Except maybe yours, Smolder.

00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:43,448

  the happiness of your homes

416
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,683
       and families just
      because I feel bad.

417
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,020
           I'm sorry.

418
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,722
   Don't worry, you won't
   have to tell our teachers.

419
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,691
            I will.

420
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,259
 Twilight: You don't have to.

421
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,294
We already know.

422
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,598
We kinda guessed
it was you.

423
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,434
But we wanted to give you
the chance to tell the truth.

424
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,936
        I'm proud that you did.

425
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,837
   And I'm glad to see you've
     been paying attention

426
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,474
    in Professor Applejack's
     honesty classes.

427
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,776
But you're still gonna
have to make amends.

428
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,980
And stay over break for
extra friendship lessons,
by yourself.

429
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,583
           I'll stay with him.

430
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,218
                       Me, too!

431
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
Yona stay also!

432
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,688
                  I'm staying!

433
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:26,825
             What?

434
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,793
           All right.

435
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,830
     I guess pony holidays
       can't be that bad.

436
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,398
      Now you can finally
      know what it's like

437
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,702
 to spend Hearth's Warming with
  friends who care about you.

438
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,674
Looks like they don't really
need any extra lessons.

439
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,076
    Since you obviously know
     that Hearth's Warming

440
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,612
       is about coming
    together, I'd be honored

441
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,248
    if all of you would
   join my friends as guests

442
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,649
     at our holiday table.

443
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,553
        [happy chatter]

444
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,488
  After we finish cleaning up.

         [squelching]

447
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,331
      Hey, this reminds
      me of another story!

448
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:12,703
 The Time I Almost Spilled
Grape Juice on the White Couch.

449
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,039
        Does it have a
       depressing ending?

450
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,742
          I'm not sure pony
          stories work that way.

451
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,780
Um. Gallus want Yona
braid feathers?

452
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,949
          Uuuh. Pass.
