                 Would somepony
                  kindly explain

149
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,250
             what is the meaning
             of all this water?

150
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,353
        I'm not sure, but I
         think it's "Surf's up!"

151
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,221
      Wheeeeee! Cowabunga!

152
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,257
         Sorry, Rarity.

153
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,492
      But I had to put out
      the raging inferno!

154
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,460
Inferno? Where?

155
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,896
Did you not see the
smoke and flame?

156
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,597
              Yeah, that was us.

157
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,799
                Y'know, DRAGONS?

158
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,235
          Having a firebreathing
           competition?

159
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,104
          You... what?

160
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,006
They do it all the time.

161
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,041
      That's what we were
      trying to tell you.

162
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,677
We know you're used to
being a hero, Rockhoof.

163
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,148
      Only... what we need
       here is a teacher.

164
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,618
One who doesn't ruin an entire
class's friendship quilts!

165
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,022
Do you know how hard it is to
stitch a pineapple pattern!?

166
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,193
   Oh. My deepest apologies.

167
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,728
      I'm not used to
      living with dragons.

168
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,131
       Or much else in
       this modern time.

169
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,267
                Professor Fossil
                made it clear

170
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,936
            I'm not welcome back
            in my old village.

171
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,371
             Seems I don't
             belong here either.

172
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,810
            WHEEEE!

173
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,418
   So apparently,
   finding Rockhoof a new job

174
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,320
is a lot harder than we thought.

175
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,389
   Has anypony had any luck?

176
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,091
          Uh uh. Nope.

177
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,230
  I thought you were gonna try
  him out at the post office.

178
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,364
            We did.

179
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,003
   Do you know where I can
   find Cranky Doodle Donkey?

180
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,205
I need to deliver his medicine!

181
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:31,076
    He has a rash in a very
   embarrassing place!

182
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,819
     [shudder] I did not
      need to hear that.

183
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,356
      Yep! Rockhoof's time
       as a spa masseuse

184
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,991
    didn't work out either.

185
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,929
  Now just let me know if
   this is too much PRESSURE.

186
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,899
        [shriek of pain]

187
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,370
   Well, at least Rockhoof's
     really strong.

188
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,774
   Maybe we could find him a
   job carrying heavy stuff?

189
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,543
     I tried that already!

190
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,246
   Zecora needed somepony to
 help her get supplies, but...

191
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,949
           [knocking]

192
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,785
    I know you said you only
    needed a few leaves,

193
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,687
     but I figured why not
   bring you the whole thing?

194
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,823
           [buzzing]

195
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,295
        Oh, how horrid.

196
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,597
None of the other Pillars
seem to be having trouble

197
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,466
fitting in to the modern world.

198
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,635
   Then maybe they can show
   Rockhoof how they did it.

199
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,871
     Get him used to
      livin' in this time.

200
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,356
          Great idea!

201
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,440
   Rockhoof's old friends
    would be happy to help.

202
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,309
     And I bet he'd
      love to visit them.

203
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,415
             Hmph.

204
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,152
   Even Canterlot looks
  different from the old days.

205
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,755
   Aw, I'm sure once you see
   your ol' pal Flash Magnus,

206
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,257
   you'll feel right at home.

207
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,761
Trot, 2, 3, 4!
Trot, 2, 3, 4!

208
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,864
    Keep it lively, rookies!

209
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,000
       Visitors on site!

210
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,902
         Company, halt!

211
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,474
       Rockhoof, you old
       ditch-digger you!

212
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,877
       Flash Magnus, as I
       live and breathe!

213
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,246
     Is this your squadron?

214
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,782
After we got out of limbo, I
went looking for work for a pony

215
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,684
       with experience in
       the Royal Legion.

216
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,387
        Once a soldier,
       always a soldier.

217
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,089
 Princess Celestia was happy to
find a new drill sergeant

218
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,358
         for her Guard!

219
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,694
         Yeah.. that's great.

220
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,764
    She really put you in a
    job that big... so soon?

221
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,799
            Oh, this is nothing!

222
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,768
             You should see what
             Mistmane is up to.

223
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,974
    They made <i>you</i> the Royal
    Landscape Artist

224
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,710
    for the Crystal Empire?

225
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:45,777
Wow.

226
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,883
      Your work is
      beautiful!

227
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,814
           Oh thank you.

228
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,317
     I've never worked
      with crystal before,

229
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,322
    but in my heart, I know
    I'm where I belong.

230
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,724
           You always could find
           the beauty in things.

231
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,695
But there's not much demand for
shovel ponies like me nowadays.

232
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,498
Don't give up hope!

233
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,433
See Somnambula.

234
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,302
She'll help you
find your purpose.

235
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,307
     Somnambula's a
     motivational speaker.

236
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,844
   Bet they didn't even have
   those back in your time.

237
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,812
Because we didn't
need them.

238
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,881
Ponies knew what to
do with their lives.

239
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:29,421
Focus on my voice, and feel
yourself unlock your potential.

240
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:36,757
    [deep inhale and exhale]

241
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:43,535
 Imagine everything that
 troubles you as one big cloud.

242
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,905
     Now let it float away.

243
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,107
        You are relaxed.

244
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,411
 Free to do anything you wish.

245
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:58,817
         [loud snoring]

246
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,585
       Guess he wished he
       could take a nap?

247
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,489
  Rockhoof: Mage Meadowbrook!

248
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,526
    Your home looks just the
     same as the old days.

249
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,494
        Wish I could say
       the same for mine.

250
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,231
Well, I've had to
expand my clinic a bit.

251
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,468
Many creatures need healing
in this modern world.

252
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,372
Oh! Looks like you
could use some too.

253
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,074
What's got you
heartsick, Rockhoof?

254
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,320
            [thud]

255
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,047
    Thing is, I can't do
     my old job like Flash.

256
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,849
    Or adapt like Mistmane.

257
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,785
    Or succeed at something
     new like Somnambula.

258
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,821
     Or go home, like you.

259
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,440
Give it time.

260
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,858
Even Starswirl's still
learning about friendship...

261
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:41,827
       Applejack: Yeah!

262
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,196
    And I bet Stygian took
   plenty of time to fit in.

263
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,765
 Hey, look what I found!

264
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,768
      "Me and My Shadow,"
      the third hit novel

265
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,736
   by former villain Stygian!

266
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,705
      I'm impressed! He's
       really thriving!

267
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,641
             [moan]

268
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,510
      Rockhoof? Where are
       you going?

269
00:12:58,912 --> 00:12:59,962
         I'm not sure.

270
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:02,813
   Maybe I just don't belong
   in this modern world.

271
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,319
     Now this here is a
     right mash of apples.

272
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,689
      'Stead of solving
      Rockhoof's problem,

273
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,557
  we made him feel even worse.

274
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,193
       I'll tell you the
       real problem here!

275
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,030
 We haven't given Rockhoof the
 chance to be who he really is.

276
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,867
   A pony with a metal shovel
   and a heart of gold?

277
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,202
           Tch. A hero!

278
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:28,340
 What we need to do is find him
 a job that's as epic as he is!

279
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,844
       Hm. I might know
       just the thing...

280
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,415
     Rockhoof: I'm honored to serve
    in the Hippogriff Navy,

281
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,683
       General Seaspray.

282
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,086
 I promise I'll prove my worth.

283
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,755
      Think nothing of it.

284
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:47,058
   I know how hard it is
    to adapt to a new home.

285
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,961
      After our many years
        below the waves,

286
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,231
  land customs seemed strange.

287
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,167
  Like you didn't fit in, no
   matter how hard you tried?

        One more story!
        One more story!

431
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,374
        No no. Thank you
         for listening.

432
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,309
 But it's time to say good-bye.

433
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,780
      Wait!

434
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,781
 You said there wasn't anything
 in this time you were good at.

435
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,784
  What about telling stories?

436
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,821
   It was just a tall tale...

437
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,390
     One that captured the
     hearts and imagination

438
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,092
     of everycreature here.

439
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,662
   Plus pony story super fun!

440
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,732
            [cheers]

441
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,868
 As the Princess of Friendship,
 I'd like to appoint you

442
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,939
    as Equestria's official
    Keeper of Tales!

443
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,007
        Can you do that?

444
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,342
         Meh.

445
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,778
      I uh.... That's
       very kind of you.

446
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,748
  But I still think these old
  bones are more suited

447
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,517
      to a museum display.

448
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,453
You are a living
record of our history.

449
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,923
Your stories can inspire and
teach generations to come!

450
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,693
If you're a statue,
that's all lost.

451
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,696
     But will I ever really
     belong in your world?

452
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,665
         Rockhoof Yona's friend.

453
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,167
      So Rockhoof belongs.

454
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:14,539
     You know, that reminds
     me of another story...

455
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:20,411
Once there was a small Yak that
knew more than a great hero.

456
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,614
     Hey, don't forget the
     dragons in this one!

457
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,349
    Aye, there were dragons!

458
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,118
          And ponies.

459
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,353
   And plenty of hippogriffs...

460
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,123
     Plus a changeling and
     a griffon that flew...
