1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,304
    That's the last entry...

2
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:08,107
    Starswirl's final words
      before he vanished!

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,876
Applejack: All those legendary
     ponies were real too?

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,413
   And then NONE of them were
     ever heard from again?

5
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:16,015
    Twilight: They used their magic to
     open a portal to limbo

6
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,152
     <i> We need to find items</i>
      <i> that are connected</i>

7
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,621
  <i> to the pillars in some way.</i>

8
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,389
      We brought you back!

9
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,525
     You cannot bring ONLY
       the pillars back!

10
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,041
      Your pitiful attempt
         to imprison me

11
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,377
     has FAILED, Starswirl!

12
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,681
  You must return us to limbo.

13
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,616
 It's the only way to stop him.

14
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,752
I only figured out
how to bring you back.

15
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:27,853
                  Working on it..

16
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,554
           No table of contents..

17
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,657
             Allow me to assist.

18
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,068
             There!

19
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,274
Without the power of Ponehenge,
your banishing spell is useless.

20
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,210
 You have studied my writings.

21
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,312
Surely you have some other plan!

22
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,348
No... I just wanted to save
you, I didn't think--

23
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,348
                    Don't fret.

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,887
When I extinguish the light and
 hope of this miserable world,

25
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,089
you won't remember any of this.

26
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:05,991
              No!

27
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,730
    This one is almost.. as
   strong as you, Starswirl.

28
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,632
 But even in my weakened state,

29
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,101
      she cannot stop the
       might of shadows!

30
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,908
Lucky for her,
she's not alone!

31
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,179
           ARRGGGHHH!

32
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,880
       Know this, fiend.

33
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:33,418
 We will not rest until we find
 a way to return you to limbo.

34
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:35,654
             Never!

35
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,223
     Your days of glory are
      through, Starswirl.

36
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:44,563
  Now my dark power will reign
  and you six will bow to me!

37
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,735
       Um, where'd he go?

38
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,137
That is a riddle
we must unravel.

39
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,205
And quickly.

40
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,240
How long have we been gone?

41
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,242
          Over a thousand years.

42
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:02,681
  Then my spell worked... before
      it was meddled with.

43
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,517
   And the realm has been at
     peace for a millennia!

44
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,120
Well, we did have to save
everypony from Nightmare Moon

45
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,290
and Discord and Chrysalis and
King Sombra and Lord Tirek and

46
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,158
there was that one time when
Starlight traveled through time

47
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,660
and almost destroyed
life as we know it!

48
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,329
But that's all in the past.

49
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,831
               If you are truly
              this accomplished,

50
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,368
 we will stop the Pony of
Shadows twice as fast together.

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,036
         We shall see.

52
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,640
   It is an easy thing to say
   you have saved the world.

53
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,842
 It is quite another to do it.

54
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,012
Oh, we've saved
the world, beardo.

55
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,681
And we can do it again.

56
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,751
 Be that as it may, the problem
of locating the Pony of Shadows

57
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:43,122
 remains and this land is vast.

58
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,190
 It sounds like you need a map.

59
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,759
Luckily, we have just the thing.

60
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,598
      Something about this
     magic seems familiar.

61
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,904
Did you know he
could do that?

62
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,005
        He's Starswirl!

63
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,240
      He can do anything!

64
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:07,012
This map and, indeed, this very
 castle are grown from the seed

65
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,815
       we planted over a
      thousand years ago.

66
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,183
               Then it did work!

67
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,283
          What worked?

68
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,787
  Each of us infused a crystal
      seed with our magic

69
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,990
  in hopes that it would grow
     into a force for good.

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,194
We wanted to leave something
to protect the realm in our absence,

71
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,899
 but we never dreamed our gift
   would become so powerful.

72
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,602
         Y'all mean the
    elements came from you?

73
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,307
You know, the sparkly
crystal things that grow

74
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,576
from the Tree of Harmony
and represent each of us?

75
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:38,844
           Laughter.

76
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:39,678
            Honesty.

77
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,746
          Generosity.

78
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:41,880
            Loyalty.

79
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:42,814
           Kindness.

80
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,849
           And magic!

81
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:50,622
They are reflections of our own
  elements of hope, strength,

82
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:54,860
        beauty, bravery,
      healing and sorcery.

83
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,532
       We had no idea our
     small seed would bloom

84
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,735
        into the living
      spirit of the land.

85
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:07,339
   I am glad our mantles have
 passed to such capable ponies.

86
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,909
    More importantly, we
    no longer need Ponhenge

87
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,245
        to send our foe
         back to limbo.

88
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:17,649
 We can use the stored magic in
    this "Tree of Harmony."

89
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,519
 But doesn't a banishing spell
    take a lot of power?

90
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,988
     We'd have to sacrifice
     the elements for that.

91
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,955
             Mm hm.

92
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:24,823
        They'd be gone...

93
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,891
            Forever?

94
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,693
Starswirl, I don't think
the Tree can survive

95
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,728
without the elements.

96
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,497
If it dies, Equestria
will suffer.

97
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,868
 If the Pony of Shadows has his
 way, your land will not exist!

98
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,305
              So unless you have
               a better idea...

99
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:51,083
 Our foe will seek dark places
   from which to draw power.

100
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,151
    I will prepare my spell,

101
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,988
    so that we may strike as
     soon as you find him.

102
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,756
    What are we waiting for?

103
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,358
I like your spirit!

104
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,426
        Uh huh! Oh yeah!

105
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,433
         What about
         this one?

106
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,505
 Sea Pony etiquette isn't going
   to help right now, Spike.

107
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,041
                   Uh, Twilight?
                    Are you OK?

108
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,844
   I just unleashed ultimate
   evil and doomed Equestria

109
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,712
     because I was obsessed
     with meeting my idol!

110
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,214
     Why wouldn't I be OK!?

111
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,350
      Pfft. You didn't know that
       was gonna happen.

112
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,686
 But I should have listened to
   you and left things alone.

113
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,889
  Now the elements of harmony
will be lost to fix my mistake!

114
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,824
   Maybe there's another way.

115
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,194
     If there is, Twilight
         will find it.

116
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,865
 Portal gate... portal keys...
    portal spells.

117
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,868
  YES! If the Pillars can hold
   open the gateway to limbo,

118
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,537
   a powerful pony can do the
    banishing spell herself!

119
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,005
  Do you know what this means!?

120
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,875
   [pant] I can stop carrying books?

121
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,311
     The Pillars don't have
      to leave Equestria!

122
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,812
       Even though we'll
       lose the elements,

123
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,614
     we'll have the ponies
       that created them.

124
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,083
    And the Pony of shadows
   will be banished for good!

125
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,685
         That's.. great. Heh.

126
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,954
       But I was thinking
         of another way

127
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,325
   that maybe doesn't involve
      "banishing" at all?

128
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,628
   Starswirl knew what he was
 doing when he cast that spell.

129
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,029
        If I can make it
          even better,

130
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,032
  maybe he'll see that I take
 magic as seriously as he does.

131
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,606
    It seems the dark places

132
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,109
     Starswirl indicated on
     the map have changed.

133
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,977
   I bet the Pony of Shadows

134
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,313
       would've loved the
        Ghastly Caverns

135
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,615
          before 1000
        years of erosion

136
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,584
       turned it into the
         Ghastly Gorge.

137
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:36,421
 The "Appeloosian Wastes" sure
   sounded dark and desolate.

138
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,622
   Who knew they would become

139
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,958
     such a popular square
      dancing destination?

140
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,127
       And I get how this
       part of Equestria

141
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,095
        used to be cast
        in eternal night

142
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,866
where the Pony of Shadows could
   draw power and wreak havoc

143
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,869
  while ponies were powerless
       to stop him, but,

144
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,571
  IT'S KINDA MADE A COMEBACK.

145
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,673
       DID I MENTION IT'S
         REALLY BRIGHT?

146
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,582
 It seems there are fewer dark
corners in the realm these days.

147
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,283
    Isn't that a good thing?

148
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:08,119
   True. The Pony of Shadows
     will have a hard time

149
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,321
                regaining power.

150
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,158
             When he rears his
           head, we'll be ready!

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,495
Isn't there some way to banish
him without losing all of you?

152
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,864
             [sigh] I wish there were.

153
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,701
    But to save our home, we
    are willing to leave it.

154
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,769
 I don't think you'll have to!

155
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,069
  My spell isn't finished yet,

156
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,340
  but I think we can send The
   Pony of Shadows to limbo

157
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,209
       without all of you
     having to go as well!

158
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:35,781
    While I appreciate your
     enthusiasm, Twilight,

159
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:40,351
this is hardly the time to take
  risks on half-baked spells.

160
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,788
Begging your pardon,
Mr. The Bearded.

161
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,825
But Twilight doesn't
do anything half-way.

162
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,528
           Especially not magic!

163
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,099
Seriously! She got her wings by
 finishing one of your spells.

164
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,167
    I think you'll find her
     work is worth reading

165
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,002
       before you dismiss
        it out of hoof!

166
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:58,738
Mm hm!

167
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,806
      While it is an
    unconventional approach,

168
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,642
    I believe it could work.

169
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,077
              Hm.

170
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,446
I suppose there
 is a chance.

171
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,849
   But we still have no idea
   where to find the villain.

172
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,526
   Maybe we should try there?

173
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,967
       The Hollow Shades.

174
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,570
    I think a branch of the
   Apple family lives there.

175
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,705
       They'd have to be
        pretty distant.

176
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,641
     The Hollow Shades was
      abandoned eons ago.

177
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,577
        Hm, that's odd.

178
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,145
 The only time the map's called
     all of us to one place

179
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,747
    was Starlight's village.

180
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,617
So it's like a
super-villain tracker!

181
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,519
No offence.

182
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,355
   Do you think the map could
      be trying to tell us

183
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,756
 where the Pony of Shadows is?

184
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,756
             Hmmm.

185
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,095
 The Tree of Harmony acting to
  protect the light of the realm....

186
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,130
 Yes, a good thought, Twilight.

187
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,201
       I will make my
      notes on this spell.

188
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,336
  Ready yourselves for battle.

189
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,406
     Uh, I know I'm not as
   experienced as all of you,

190
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:10,075
     but is banishment
    really the only option?

191
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,110
 I mean, it's been a long time.

192
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,347
     Maybe the Pony of
   Shadows is ready to talk?

193
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,017
    I doubt we can save our
 homeland with a conversation.

194
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,517
But we could try.

195
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:24,355
 Starlight, I'm sure Starswirl
    and the others did try.

196
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,492
  The Pony of Shadows was not
 interested in reconciliation.

197
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,428
                Once a villain,
               always a villain.

198
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,331
      Twilight? Sunburst?
    Would you accompany me?

199
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,135
     I wish to refine this
       spell for our use.

200
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,405
     Come! We must prepare
    for the struggle ahead.

201
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,477
       [sigh] I know Starswirl
       is a great wizard,

202
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,480
         but this whole
       plan seems... wrong.

203
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,816
  The map's only ever sent us
 to solve friendship problems.

204
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,252
       Maybe so, but the
        Pony of Shadows

205
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,088
  doesn't really seem like the
    friendship type.

206
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,188
           Honestly?

207
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,825
         We don't know
      anything about him.

208
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,894
                   Nopony does.

209
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,963
That's not entirely true.

210
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,541
You all knew the Pony of Shadows
before he became what he is now.

211
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,309
   You must've been friends..

212
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,444
       So what happened?

213
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,281
        The tale of our
       rift is a sad one.

214
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,834
 Rockhoof:<i> Stygian was a pony</i>
     <i> like the rest of us,</i>

215
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,669
<i>though more scholar than hero.</i>

216
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,705
       <i> He recognized our</i>
        <i> emerging world</i>

217
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,040
     <i> would need champions</i>
       <i> to defend it.</i>

218
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,327
  Flash Magnus:<i> He may have</i>
     <i> gathered us together,</i>

219
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,697
   <i> but he, himself was just</i>
      <i> an ordinary unicorn</i>

220
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,999
     <i> who soon grew jealous</i>
       <i> of our abilities.</i>

221
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,605
  Mistmane:<i> He stole objects</i>
      <i> from each of us ...</i>

222
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,142
 <i> artifacts to use in a spell.</i>

223
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,377
   Meadowbrook:<i> And we cast</i>
        <i> him out for it.</i>

224
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,348
    Somnambula:<i> We always</i>
      <i> thought he'd return</i>

225
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,983
     <i> and seek forgiveness.</i>

226
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:36,756
<i>But when we saw him again, his</i>
  <i> heart was bent on revenge.</i>

227
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,491
       <i> He dashed even my</i>
      <i> hope of saving him.</i>

228
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,464
          But why did he steal
         the artifacts from you?

229
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,702
No doubt it was an enchantment
to take our powers for himself.

230
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:51,871
                      Hm.

231
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,577
 That looks like a lot of work.

232
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,080
    It is what must be done
      and it would be best

233
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,682
   if we were not disturbed.

234
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,985
       I'm sorry, Starlight, but
        we can't stop to talk.

235
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,553
            The stakes are too
          high and we have to...

236
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,056
banish Stygian to limbo.
  I get it.

237
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,157
        Uh, who?

238
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,893
    Stygian was the name the
    Pony of Shadows gave up

239
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,895
  when he turned to darkness.

240
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,630
And I'm just trying
to figure out why.

241
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,133
      Envy. He wanted more
       power than he had

242
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,168
      and that desire led
        him down a path

243
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,171
 from which there is no return.

244
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,374
     I know from experience
    that's not always true.

245
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,542
      When the map called
     you six to my village,

246
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,111
          it was for a
      friendship problem.

247
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,179
Are you sure this is different?

248
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:35,879
              I...

249
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,350
  Stygian wants to destroy all
  that is good in this world.

250
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,353
       There's no way to
   befriend a pony like that.

251
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,824
I guess I'm lucky your
idol wasn't around

252
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,992
      when you decided to
         be my friend.

253
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,395
        I might've been
     banished to limbo too.

254
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,604
   Somnambula: I am glad we
     have the chance to see

255
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,174
    what has grown from our
      efforts so long ago.

256
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,044
                It seems a shame
                  to harm it.

257
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,646
     A necessary sacrifice.

258
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:08,746
   With the elements' power,

259
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,849
     we will bind the Pony
      of Shadows in limbo.

260
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,183
    And thanks to Twilight,

261
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,919
    we will remain to watch
   over the realm ourselves.

262
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,235
    Um, how do we use them?

263
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,072
  Well, you--Oh. I'm not sure.

264
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,406
    They simply work for us.

265
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,075
        The elements are
        attuned to you.

266
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,043
       We must use their
        magic in pairs.

267
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,445
      No problem!

268
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,381
    We're used to banishing
     evil before breakfast.

269
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,951
    And it'll be an honor to
   save Equestria with y'all.

270
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,723
     I really hope Twilight
    knows what she's doing.

271
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,062
    I don't remember reading
     anything that said

272
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,999
       the Hollow Shades
         was like this.

273
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,302
   Oh... the Pony of Shadows
      must have twisted it

274
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,703
        to his purposes.

275
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,276
   [evil laugh]
 Prepare yourselves.

276
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,977
          He is here.

277
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,447
         Stygian! Show
     yourself and face us!

278
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,983
        [evil laughter]
         [rumbling]

279
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,901
    I definitely would have
 remembered reading about this.

280
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,079
 Welcome to the Well of Shade!

281
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,583
 When you turned your backs on
  me, I discovered this place.

282
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,453
  The darkness spoke to me of
    a power beyond any

283
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,523
I could imagine and I listened.

284
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,025
  The shadow and I became one.

285
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,629
     Soon all of the realm
       will be the same.

286
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:08,532
      Then all ponies will
     feel the despair I did

287
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,435
     when you cast me out!

288
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,370
        We did
       what we had to do.

289
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,774
     You tried to steal our
      powers for yourself!

290
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,476
No! It was you who were selfish!

291
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,512
     And now you will pay!

292
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,851
Are you still sure this
isn't a friendship problem?

293
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,386
                    Ready?

294
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,854
              Open the portal...

295
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:32,891
              NOW!

296
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,606
        No! You will not
         trap me again!

297
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,508
          Twilight! Push him in!

298
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:52,812
              Huh?

299
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,314
    There's... a pony in there.

300
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:04,622
           Are you...

301
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:05,690
            Stygian?

302
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,792
          I was, once.

303
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,961
 Until my friends betrayed me.

304
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,630
But Starswirl says
you betrayed them.

305
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,298
You wanted their magic.

306
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,601
                   No! I wanted
                  their respect.

307
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,069
              I brought them
                together.

308
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,104
     I planned strategy and
       I read all I could

309
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,639
   about the beasts we faced.

310
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,775
       But I didn't have
       magic or strength.

311
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,844
  So nopony ever noticed me.

312
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:30,048
 I went to Ponehenge to make my
  own copies of the artifacts.

313
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,417
     With them, I thought I
     could be a Pillar too!

314
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,619
       And stand by their
        side in battle.

315
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,488
       I never wanted to
       steal their power.

316
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,391
     But instead of sharing
      and letting me help,

317
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,226
    my friends threw me out.

318
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,829
      So I became stronger
       than any of them!

319
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,598
    The darkness welcomed me
      when no pony would.

320
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,134
        I will do what I
      must to protect it!

321
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,336
  This is all a
misunderstanding!

322
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,238
         If the Pillars
       knew how you felt,

323
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,807
  I'm sure they wouldn't have
   turned their backs on you.

324
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,110
The shadow isn't
who you really are.

325
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,312
Let me help you
be Stygian again.

326
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,781
              Even if my friends
               did still care,

327
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,684
       what makes you think you
      have the power to help me?

328
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,519
Starlight: Because it's
  what she does.

329
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,990
 I wasn't so different from you
 and Twilight helped me change.

330
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,526
If there's one pony in Equestria
that can save a friendship,

331
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:16,761
it's her.

332
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,431
       I--I want to believe you....

333
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,134
        But the darkness
      will not be stopped!

334
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,811
  Fight the darkness, Stygian!

335
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,779
   You don't need it anymore.

336
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,749
     Revenge isn't what you
      want, friendship is!

337
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:41,853
           Twilight!

338
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,793
Ugh.. the shadow won't let go of him.

339
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,396
     He wants to stop, but
     he can't do it alone!

340
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,531
     Then we must help him.

341
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:23,628
     YEAH! It felt so good
       to do that again!

342
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,830
     Friendship power rush!

343
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:26,631
              WOO!

344
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,499
         The elements!

345
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,867
     They didn't disappear.

346
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,303
   Maybe because we used them
    for healing magic

347
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,638
     instead of banishing?

348
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,505
             Look!

349
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,910
Long ago you needed
our help, Stygian,

350
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,081
but instead of listening,
we turned our backs on you.

351
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,516
Pride clouded my judgment.

352
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,652
I owe you an apology.

353
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:52,256
Thank you for helping us see the
errors of our ways, Twilight.

354
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,260
   It seems I never accounted
  for the magic of friendship.

355
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,396
     Thank you, Swirlstar.

356
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,898
           Er... Starswirl!

357
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,969
AHEM.

358
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,907
So apparently a conversation
can save Equestria?

359
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,980
  Something tells me I will be
making a lot of apologies today.

360
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,620
    I simply cannot believe
    how tall you've gotten!

361
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:26,157
       Well, it has been
     over a thousand years.

362
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,893
     Will you stay here and
    teach magic once again?

363
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,563
 My sister and I have such fond
   memories of your lessons.

364
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,266
  As long as you don't ask for
    those essays we owed you

365
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,834
before you disappeared.

366
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,738
   I am not certain Canterlot
    is where I belong.

367
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,508
   The realm has grown and I
believe I'll have a look around

368
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,777
        before I settle
       in any one place.

369
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,948
And I long to see what
has become of my home.

370
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,417
      I believe we all do.

371
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,454
 Then I hope you will return to
  Canterlot on occasion

372
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,123
    and share the wisdom of
     your great experience

373
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,626
      with the next
     generation of ponies.

374
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,695
  We would be honored, but
   if it is wisdom you seek,

375
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,131
        look no further
      than your own pupil.

376
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,700
     She showed me that the
      power of friendship

377
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,070
   is a magical force indeed.

378
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,105
      And that in turning
       away from others,

379
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,074
   you hurt yourself as well.

380
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,846
     It's funny. I thought
      meeting my idol

381
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,148
     would give me all the
     answers I ever wanted.

382
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,018
     But instead, I forgot
      what I already knew.

383
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,254
   Good thing I had a student
    of my own to remind me.
