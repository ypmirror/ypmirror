1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,570
I know!

2
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:08,270
I can't believe it either!

3
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:10,170
The map has never
called<i> me</i> before.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,412
I'm sure that's not why
she looks like that.

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,047
Actually it is.

6
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:18,751
Well, it's that and the fact
that you're being called

7
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:19,851
to the royal palace!

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,088
I mean, what in Equestria
could be going on there?

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,391
Do you want me to come
with you? No. I shouldn't.

10
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:28,227
The map just called you
for a reason, right?

11
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,328
Though maybe it's a mistake.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,328
Not because of you!

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,198
Because it's never called
just one of us before.

14
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:38,203
I also wasn't nervous
before, but now...

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,203
Don't worry.

16
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,073
For all we know,
it's something small!

17
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,673
Like maybe the cooks
are fighting over

18
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,044
who has the best
butternut squash soup.

19
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,946
Or the royal hairdressers
are fighting over a comb!

20
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,648
Or ya know, maybe
the royal sisters

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,216
aren't seeing eye-to-eye
on something.

22
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,317
No!

23
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,617
That's just crazy!

24
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,322
Luna and Celestia
would never fight... again.

25
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,596
So, the map sent you to
solve a friendship problem?

26
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,465
Yes, Princess.

27
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,100
Well, there's
nothing wrong here.

28
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,601
Right, sister?

29
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,971
No, everything's perfect
as usual, sister.

30
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,586
Agh!

31
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,821
Psst. Psst!

32
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:10,229
Twilight...? Is that you?

33
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,630
How are you here?

34
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:15,067
I'm not, I'm still home.
It's an easy spell.

35
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,968
I'll show you later.

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,267
Anyway, enough
about me!

37
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:18,167
I had to
check on you.

38
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:19,167
Not in a
meddling kind of way,

39
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,239
in a friendly
how's-it-going way.

40
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,373
Sooo, how's it going?

41
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,542
Not great.

42
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,312
I think the problem might be
between Celestia and Luna!

43
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,281
Oh, no! That's terrible!

44
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,582
I mean...

45
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,151
What makes you say that?

46
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,753
You know how someponies
say nothing's wrong

47
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,957
but you can tell something's
definitely wrong?

48
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,359
Noooo.

49
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,327
That's basically what
the princesses did

50
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,263
when I said there was
a friendship problem.

51
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,632
Only they did it more,
you know, regally.

52
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,734
I wish I could help
you, but I can't.

53
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:51,436
Both for map reasons and
because I have no idea.

54
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,504
This is big!

55
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,839
Like really big!

56
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,042
But I'm here if
you ever need to talk.

57
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,110
Or listen to music!

58
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,080
♪♪

59
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:02,514
Heh.
Comforting, right?

60
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,422
Thank you so much for
breakfast, Princess.

61
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,424
I can't believe you
cook it yourself!

62
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,725
Of course, Starlight.

63
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,496
I really enjoy doing it.

64
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,365
It's a small way to
say "I care."

65
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,637
Good morning, sister!

66
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,372
Join us?

67
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:27,839
Too tired.

68
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,876
Please excuse me.

69
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,515
Wow. Last night must have
been really hard on her.

70
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:40,319
Perhaps, but she is
like this every morning.

71
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:49,962
So I think Luna may be hurting
her sister's feelings

72
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,830
without even realizing it.

73
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:52,930
Poor Celestia.

74
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,467
That's so sweet that she makes
her sister pancakes

75
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,568
every morning.

76
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,236
She's your mentor.

77
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,038
I think you might be biased.

78
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,938
Fair enough.

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,541
So what are you going to do?

80
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,409
Nothing. Yet.

81
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,809
I have to get all the facts.

82
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:08,380
I asked Luna if I could spend
some time with her this evening.

83
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,150
Princess Luna is waiting
for you, Miss.

84
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,289
Good luck, Starlight!

85
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,962
Wow, Princess Luna.

86
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,797
You do this every night?

87
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,433
Lavender's calming scent
is known to aid dreamers

88
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,402
in achieving a
restorative sleep.

89
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,672
That's so thoughtful!

90
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,107
I try my best to make sure the
ponies in this castle

91
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,909
sleep peacefully.

92
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,712
(old woman voice)
So then I said, "touring?

93
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,414
More like boring!"

94
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,483
Ha ha hah!

95
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,685
You really are a card!

96
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,591
But as always, my sister's
too busy having fun

97
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:55,594
with dignitary ponies to
acknowledge anything I do.

98
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,862
Humph!

99
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,369
So both princesses are hurting
each other without realizing it

100
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,904
and instead of talking about it,

101
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,307
they're just getting
colder and more distant.

102
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,807
And they're Celestia and Luna,

103
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,977
so it's not like you
can just confront them.

104
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,279
Actually, that's exactly
what I was gonna do.

105
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,213
WHAT!?

106
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,581
Are you CRAZY!?

107
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,652
I mean, you do whatever
you think is best.

108
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,187
This is your mission.

109
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,257
Gee, thanks for believing
in me, Twilight.

110
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,357
I do!

111
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,694
But... the last time the
princesses fought,

112
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:31,463
Luna turned into Nightmare Moon
and Princess Celestia

113
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,632
had to banish her for
a thousand years!

114
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,667
That can't happen again.

115
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,167
Well, I can't do nothing!

116
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,237
The princesses aren't the
best at communicating

117
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,138
with each other.

118
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:41,913
Sorry.

119
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,702
It's just you
said "princesses"

120
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,830
and "aren't the the best"
in the same sentence

121
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:46,970
and it's making me nervous!

122
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,915
I'm not much help, am I?

123
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,049
No!

124
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,821
Wow, I almost feel
bad eating this.

125
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,089
It's adorable!

126
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,624
Like I said, I
enjoy this part.

127
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,697
Hi.

128
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,032
Princess Luna! Wait.

129
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,740
As you both know, the map
sent me here for a reason

130
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:18,810
and I think I've
found out what it is.

131
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,647
Really? Oh, that is
wonderful, Starlight.

132
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,849
What is it?

133
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,650
You two.

134
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,686
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me?

135
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:31,456
I think you're accidentally
hurting each other's feelings

136
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,958
..without realizing it.

137
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,463
Princess Celestia, does it
bother you that Luna never

138
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,867
notices the wonderful breakfasts
that you prepare for her?

139
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,638
Uh...yes. It does.

140
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,575
Princess Luna, tell Celestia how
you feel about the fact

141
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,344
that she never
acknowledges the work

142
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:53,912
you put into
lining the hallway

143
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,180
with lavender every night.

144
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:59,485
I...Well, it's not
the best feeling.

145
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:04,990
I'm sorry I never noticed that you
make fruit faces on pancakes.

146
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,790
But nights are long for me!

147
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,528
You might be a morning
pony, but I am half asleep!

148
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,596
You think I don't get tired?

149
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,565
I'm exhausted!

150
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,802
Oh, I apologize for not noticing
flowers in a wall sconce,

151
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,004
but by the time I get
to retire for the night,

152
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,705
I can barely see straight.

153
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:24,109
Even so, I still make
an effort to smile.

154
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,446
Like smiling is so hard!

155
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,415
I'm sure that's not what
Princess Luna meant to say.

156
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,551
Is that what "exhausts" you?

157
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,153
Smiling and being
adored by everypony?

158
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,689
And you have it so
much worse, do you?

159
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,491
You spend your evenings
flitting around

160
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,526
giving ponies
lovely dreams!

161
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,261
Oh, it sounds just awful.

162
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,096
O....K.

163
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,500
I feel like we should step
back, take a deep breath...

164
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,736
Don't presume to know what it is
like to govern the dream realm!

165
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,673
And yet you know exactly
what it's like to be me?

166
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,107
Oh, please!

167
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,108
Enough!

168
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,048
There!

169
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,954
Now you'll know exactly what
it's like to be each other!

170
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,095
What have you done?

171
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,264
I went with my gut?

172
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,800
Switch our cutie marks
back this instant!

173
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,300
My apologies,
Your Majesties.

174
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,637
But I can't, even
if I wanted to.

175
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,039
This spell lasts
twenty-four hours.

176
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,775
It may have been extreme, but...

177
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,278
I think it's still a good idea?

178
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,046
What?

179
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,546
You said it yourselves.

180
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,883
Neither of you believes
your sister knows

181
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,552
how hard it is to be you.

182
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,521
So this is your
chance to prove it.

183
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,893
Well, I could use
an easy day

184
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,761
followed by a good
night's sleep.

185
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,096
You can try.

186
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,165
I haven't had an easy
day in well, ever.

187
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,569
But now, I get to sleep and
tonight will be a breeze.

188
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,938
All right, Starlight Glimmer.

189
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,639
We will do this.

190
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,473
Good choice.

191
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,774
Not that you had one.

192
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,011
I'm gonna stop
talking now.

193
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,384
You switched their cutie marks!?

194
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,787
The actual princesses'
CUTIE MARKS!?

195
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,590
Uh.. I thought we
moved past this!

196
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,959
It was the right
call... I hope.

197
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,696
Are you OK in there?

198
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,064
I'm good!

199
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,232
Just uh ...

200
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,100
reading an exciting book!

201
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,036
He's going to think I'm nuts!

202
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,871
He's not the only one.

203
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,811
As you can see, Celestia and
I are switching places today.

204
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,014
Huh?

205
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,084
I assure you, I am more than
capable of handling

206
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,821
all of Celestia's
"duties." Dismissed!

207
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,861
So what is first on my
dear sister's 'to do' list?

208
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,233
It says you have a few
public appearances.

209
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,569
Store openings, judging the
Royal Rose contest, you know,

210
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,671
that sort of thing.

211
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,373
Oh, I knew today would be easy

212
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,542
but I didn't think it
would be that easy.

213
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,022
"Princess Luna Unhappy
With Student Fund-raiser?"

214
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,656
But I wasn't unhappy.

215
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,961
Um, you are scowling.

216
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,329
I didn't mean to.

217
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,131
I'd been smiling all day.

218
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,233
My cheeks hurt; I
stopped for one second

219
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,502
and that's when he
took the picture!

220
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:14,372
Guess smiling all day isn't
as easy as you thought?

221
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,777
It says here that
because of me,

222
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,880
the school didn't raise enough
funds to go on their field trip.

223
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,115
I-I-I didn't mean for
that to happen!

224
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,317
I know.

225
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,286
But you can't dwell on that now.

226
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,722
According to the list, some
delegates are about to arrive

227
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,223
for a luncheon.

228
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,525
You need to dispel
rumors of Timberwolves

229
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,925
in the White Tail Woods.

230
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,930
The nearby towns have been in
a state of panic for weeks.

231
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,732
B-B-But I have to fix this!

232
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,868
You can't.

233
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,605
You need to put on a brave
face and help these ponies.

234
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,173
It's what Celestia would do.

235
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,779
HELLO! GREAT NEWS!

236
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,715
THERE ARE NO TIMBERWOLVES!

237
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,119
There are definitely
timberwolves!

238
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,488
I'm sorry, but I
couldn't stop thinking

239
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,390
about those poor students!

240
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,359
Normally, I have all the time
and solitude I need

241
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,595
to work through my
problems at my own pace.

242
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,498
Well, your sister
doesn't get that luxury.

243
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,837
Ready for the
town hall?

244
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,577
Glad that's settled.

245
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,380
That only took
three hours.

246
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,082
That got heated
didn't it?

247
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,050
Still on for
golf?

248
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,418
Oh, absolutely!

249
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,286
You made it to the
end of the day!

250
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,686
Yay?

251
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:41,893
Hmm? Oh, yes I'm just
going to turn in then.

252
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,295
Goodlight, Starnight.

253
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,866
Oh, hello, Starlight!

254
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:51,069
I don't know about you, but
I feel very well-rested!

255
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,138
Where's Luna?

256
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,340
Um.. she already turned
in for the night.

257
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,442
Did she now?

258
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,179
It seems my duties were harder
than my sister expected.

259
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,452
Moon raised.

260
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,521
It's even easier
than raising the sun!

261
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,156
What's next?

262
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,093
Of course.

263
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,095
Everypony's asleep at night.

264
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,164
Luna works alone.

265
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,466
Oh, but it's nothing
I can't handle!

266
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,802
All I have to do is
watch over Equestria,

267
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,237
visit the dream realm
and protect ponies

268
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,138
in their nightmares.

269
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,274
My list was three
times as long!

270
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,044
All right.

271
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,979
Everypony's asleep.

272
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,382
You're talking to
yourself, Celestia.

273
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,150
But there's nopony
else to talk to!

274
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,451
Yet.

275
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,787
I can talk to ponies
in their dreams!

276
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,498
Now to save some ponies
from their nightmares,

277
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,967
which aren't real so it
shouldn't be too hard, right?

278
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,036
Right. Good call, Celestia!

279
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,906
And I'm talking to myself again.

280
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,377
I care.

281
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,378
I care.

282
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,580
I Care.

283
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,118
No!

284
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,721
This is big!

285
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:17,955
Like really big!

286
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:18,923
Wah!

287
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,859
Starlight, I'm here now.

288
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,460
Tell me what's wrong.

289
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,163
Going with my gut
was the wrong call!

290
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,365
I was supposed to bring
you two closer together,

291
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,467
but I've only driven you apart!

292
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,603
If you two can't see why
you need each other, then...

293
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,438
Then I am back!

294
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,978
Don't worry, Starlight.

295
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,182
I know how to handle
Nightmare Moon.

296
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:49,254
Yes, but can you handle.... me?

297
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,000
This can't be!

298
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,469
If Luna can turn
into Nightmare Moon,

299
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:08,506
you can absolutely turn
into me, Daybreaker!

300
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:12,410
The better, prettier and
more powerful version of you.

301
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,113
No. I'll never turn into you!

302
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,848
Deep inside you know
how powerful you are.

303
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,850
You don't need Luna.

304
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,386
That's not true.

305
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,390
Even when we were apart,
I knew I needed her.

306
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,593
Oh, please!

307
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,162
You don't need anypony.

308
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,499
You can do whatever you want
and all you have to do

309
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,236
is get rid of anypony
who stands in your way.

310
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,175
I never should have
banished you to the moon.

311
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,344
I should have destroyed you!

312
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,246
No! You can't do that!

313
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:52,216
Day, night, sun, moon -
Equestria needs both of you.

314
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,385
Without balance,
there's no harmony!

315
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,491
Who needs balance when
you can have it all?

316
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,397
You can't get rid of
me so easily, sister.

317
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,667
Unless you plan on
smiling me to smithereens!

318
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,803
Enough!

319
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,774
I told you I was more
powerful than you.

320
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,812
Ugh. So much black.

321
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,414
We get it, you're sad!

322
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,484
You could really use some.. SUN!

323
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,430
This is all my fault!

324
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,532
I never should have
gone on this mission.

325
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,601
Now Equestria is doomed!

326
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,411
<i> ♪ That smile's too wide. ♪</i>

327
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,614
<i> ♪ It's obviously not real. ♪</i>

328
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,325
Why don't you want us to go
on our field trip?

329
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:08,860
I don't--

330
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,633
I mean, I do!

331
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:15,567
<i> ♪ That smile's too wide. ♪</i>

332
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,837
<i> ♪ It's obviously not real. ♪</i>

333
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,172
Celestia!

334
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,473
I'm so glad you're...

335
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,515
I've seen a lot,

336
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,184
but I haven't seen this before.

337
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,684
It's Starlight Glimmer's.

338
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,622
She's afraid this is what would
happen if we continue to fight!

339
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,290
What was I thinking?

340
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,527
I'm never going
with my gut again!

341
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,296
If you don't fix this soon, it
could have a grave consequence

342
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,764
on Starlight's psyche.

343
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,633
But my magic isn't
powerful enough.

344
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,468
I thought if we
work together--

345
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,470
I have your magic,
remember?

346
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,938
It doesn't work in
the dream realm.

347
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,640
It has to be you.

348
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,775
Oh, Luna, I can't
do this!

349
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,412
I was wrong. Your job
is so incredibly hard.

350
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,481
You have to battle nightmares
and work in the darkness

351
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,316
and do it all alone!

352
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,753
It takes such a brave, strong
pony to do what you do!

353
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,621
--and that pony is you.

354
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,221
I walked a day in your shoes.

355
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:14,992
I thought all you had to do
was smile and be adored

356
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,027
all the time, but I was wrong.

357
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,129
There is so much
more to it than that.

358
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,780
Don't do this to each other!

359
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,418
In order to defeat Daybreaker,

360
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,288
you need only to trust in
your strength, as I do.

361
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,629
You can't destroy me!

362
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,133
I'm everything you want to be!

363
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,301
No, you're not!

364
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:01,372
You are not real and you
will never exist again!

365
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,480
You did it!

366
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,449
Only because you were here.

367
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,952
I don't know how
you do this alone.

368
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,152
So um...

369
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,354
did you talk
to yourself?

370
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,722
Um... a little.

371
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,159
Is this really happening?

372
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,693
Or is this still a dream?

373
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,201
Welcome back, sister!

374
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:34,005
I know you had a long night
so.. I made you some pancakes.

375
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:35,606
Oh!

376
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,842
How... nice.

377
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,910
Ahem.

378
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,215
They are ...delicious.

379
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,483
Thank you.

380
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,255
I know that face;
they're not.

381
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,558
I know you have to be
perfect for everypony else

382
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,429
and you do an amazing job but
you don't have to do it for me.

383
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,232
In that case...
they are terrible!

384
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,335
I know!

385
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:07,606
But it means a lot
that you tried.

386
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,979
I love you, sister.

387
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:10,662
I love you too.

388
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,578
So... this was real!

389
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,616
Or was it not real and
this just happened now

390
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,718
and not in my dream?

391
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,486
I'm so confused.

392
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,224
It's all real.

393
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,960
It was the right call,
going with your gut.

394
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,495
The map was wise to
send you, Starlight.

395
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:35,333
Nopony else would have been
so bold as to do what you did.

396
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:38,702
That's a nice way of saying
I came dangerously close

397
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,238
to messing everything up.

398
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
It was just
what we needed.

399
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,942
The experience has made
us closer than ever.

400
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,848
Wait...

401
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,082
I'm not doing this!

402
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,853
♪♪

403
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:59,290
I believe that one means
your mission is complete.

404
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,659
Wow. I can't wait
to tell Twilight!

405
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,427
I already know!

406
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,027
I mean I don't know everything.

407
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,731
I just got here to bring
you your toothbrush.

408
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,631
So this is just
a friendly visit,

409
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,731
not interfering because I
was worried! I wasn't.

410
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,404
I knew you could do it and
I'm so so so so proud of you!

411
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,172
Tell me everything! Start
from after I hyperventilated

412
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,807
and don't leave
out any details!

413
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,412
Oh, uh, by the way,
there's a field trip

414
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,512
you need to make happen

415
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:25,650
and a.. timberwolf issue
you need to address.

416
00:21:25,674 --> 00:21:26,351
What!?

417
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,352
Oh! Look there's the sun!
Time for me to turn in!
