1
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:05,204
       I do appreciate you
       showing me the way

2
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,139
        to the phoenix's
         nests, Spike.

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,974
Anything for you, Rarity.

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,310
        Besides, I've been
       meaning to visit Pee Wee.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,646
        He really was an
         excellent pet.

6
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,815
             I can't imagine why
              you set him free.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,319
     Phoenixes aren't meant
       to be domesticated.

8
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:22,654
    Even in the wild, they
   like to keep to themselves.

9
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,358
    Well, they are beautiful.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,795
A few of their feathers will add
 just the right splash of color

11
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:30,446
         to my latest...

12
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,296
Spike! What are you doing?

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,499
          Agh! Nothing.

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,235
Is there something
wrong with your face?

15
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,971
       It's a stone scale.

16
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,373
        It isn't magical
         or anything

17
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,008
        like the call of
        the Dragon Lord.

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,513
     It's just red and
     itchy and embarrassing.

19
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,517
Ooooh, precious pants.

20
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,653
That does look
uncomfortable.

21
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,423
But even I get the odd
blemish from time to time;

22
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,292
it's nothing to
be embarrassed by.

23
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,430
You could pay
Zecora a visit.

24
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,599
She makes a cream
that works wonders.

25
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,701
Just don't get
the shampoo.

26
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,738
   There's Pee Wee's parents!

27
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,041
    But I don't see Pee Wee.

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,643
Maybe he moved out.

29
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,778
Everypony has to leave
the nest at some point.

30
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,048
                    Pee Wee!

31
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:29,788
              OUCH!

32
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,863
 Perhaps you should pay Zecora a
 visit sooner rather than later.

33
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,899
[sigh] I don't want
anypony else to see this.

34
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:45,304
  Besides, I'm sure it'll clear
 up after a good night's sleep.

35
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,513
I can't believe
you're still asleep.

36
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,950
  Ugh. Just five more minutes.

37
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,688
 It's nearly noon and
you promised to help me

38
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,656
       with my lecture
        for class today.

39
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,726
Noon? Whoa. I slept like a rock.

40
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,261
        Which reminds me,
         all that sleep

41
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,762
       probably cleared up
         my stone scale!

42
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:16,101
[gasp] Um. On second thought, you can
  go back to sleep if you want.

43
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,505
           Aaaaaaaaah!

44
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,314
Spike, what
are you doing?

45
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,816
         Hiding. From my
          hideous face!

46
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,919
I'm sure it feels terrible,
but it's just a breakout.

47
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,288
 It's not the end of the world.

48
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,157
   That's easy for you to say.

49
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,725
     Your face isn't covered
     in itchy red spots.

50
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,462
            I used to get
            terrible break outs,

51
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,166
           anytime I had a final
            exam with Celestia,

52
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,568
    who probably never had a
     blemish her whole life.

53
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,805
                Well, I'm not in
                magic school.

54
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,574
No, but these things
can be stress-related,

55
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,077
and you did spend
yesterday with Rarity.

56
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,480
    Heh! What could possibly
    be stressful about that?

57
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,949
You could try Zecora.

58
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,884
She makes a
cream that--

59
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,818
                --works wonders.
                I've heard.

60
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,590
         But I'm not
       leaving the castle

61
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,757
      until my face is back
      to its adorable self.

62
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:52,031
   Fine. But you're still gonna help
     me practice my lecture.

63
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,437
 Ahem. The element of generosity
 and its importance in relation

64
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,105
        to the other
      Elements of Harmony-

65
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,245
    My lecture!

66
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,247
                   I don't know
                  what happened.

67
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,915
                I just had a
                sudden case of--

68
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,421
   ...indigestion.

69
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,289
  I'm so sorry!

70
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,691
         Oooh. That's OK.

71
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,194
     I'm sure I can rewrite
   the lecture from my notes.

72
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,196
I have a lot.

73
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:25,997
I can help you with...

74
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,034
     Maybe you should leave
      the castle after all

75
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,837
               and go somewhere
              less... flammable?

76
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,881
    Hey there, not handsome.

77
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,916
       Rarity: Oh, Spiiiike!

78
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,156
My, what a fetching ensemble
you've put together.

79
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,824
Very noir-esque.

80
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,994
[giggle] I believe Shadow Spade
herself would approve.

81
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,864
          Uh... thanks.

82
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,666
  But I wonder if you wouldn't
    mind taking it off.

83
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,733
What? Oh, I, uh...I..

84
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,940
    Sorry? You'll have to speak up;

85
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,575
    my ears are a little bit
     clogged, or something.

86
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,943
   It's just that I absolutely
     must have a model

87
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,514
for my phoenix feather dress and
  nopony else is available.

88
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,582
         Sorry, Rarity, but I...

89
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:22,687
       I am super busy all day
     giving... tours of the school.

90
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,789
       Pinkie Pie: Really?

91
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,591
         I thought I was
       giving tours today.

92
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,392
           Guess not.

93
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,193
            Free day!

94
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,628
         Whee! Whoo hoo!

95
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,934
    Class rooms are that way.

96
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:36,969
             Dorms are that way.

97
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,603
 Twilight's office is up there.

98
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,038
       This is a fountain.

99
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,242
  Uh. Could you slow down a bit?

100
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,111
           We've come a long way
            to see the school.

101
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,313
                I-I don't wanna
                miss anything.

102
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,781
          Oh. Um, yeah.

103
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,418
             Sorry.

104
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,853
             Is something wrong?

105
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,989
         What? Why? No!

106
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,561
D-Do all the dragons at this
school suffer from scale issues?

107
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,628
 [very hoarse] I don't know.

108
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,597
                    What?

109
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,000
[strained] I
 don't know.

110
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:12,337
           I-I'm sorry, did you
           say "fireworks show"?

111
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,540
I said..
 [shouting] I DON'T KNOW.

112
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,423
     [shouting] THIS IS THE
       SCHOOL LIBRARY!

113
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,926
   IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SERENE
 SPOTS ON CAMPUS WHERE STUDENTS

114
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,896
     CAN SPEND TIME IN QUIET
      REFLECTION OR STUDY.

115
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,265
              WHAT!

116
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,134
Could you please stop shouting?

117
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,238
We're trying to do our homework
and it's kind of distracting.

118
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,273
         WAS I SHOUTING?

119
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,245
       Ahem. I have no idea what
         you're talking-

120
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,398
                  If you're
                 trying to hide,

121
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,200
                you need to
                do a better job.

122
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,003
             All I had to do was
              follow the smoke.

123
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,374
    [hoarse] Leave me alone.

124
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,575
                         What?

125
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,713
Leave... me... alone.

126
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,614
                 I can't under-

127
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,084
              Was that, "sleeves
                made of foam"?

128
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,620
     I said leave ME ALONE.

129
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,898
  Wow! I have seen some pretty
    bad molts in my time,

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,468
    but yours takes the cake.

131
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,802
             Molts?

132
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,321
                    The molt?

133
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:55,839
             Super painful stone
             scales, fire burps,

134
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,143
  uncontrollable volume shifts?

135
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,078
It's all part of
growing up dragon.

136
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,112
    Congrats!

137
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:02,848
                 Agh!

138
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,783
    Oh. Sorry.

139
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,658
     No, no, no, no, no! The
      last time I grew up,

140
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,827
     I turned into a giant,
      greedy monster!

141
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,130
   Greed-induced bigness.
    That's totally different.

142
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,168
 The molt is completely normal.

143
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,003
  Every dragon goes through it.

144
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,706
    Pretty soon you'll leave
   and strike out on your own.

145
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,092
                     Why would I
                      do that?

146
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:32,377
    Have you been living with
     ponies your whole life?

147
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,778
                   Uh huh.

148
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,830
      Oh.

149
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,781
Well, in the Dragonlands,
a molter's loved ones

150
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,151
      kicks them out at the
       first stone scale.

151
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,353
      What? Why?

152
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,155
    I think it's biological.

153
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,358
  We call it the "Molt Effect".

154
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,260
     I haven't even told
      you about the smell.

155
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,128
     Smell?

156
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:51,562
          Agh!

157
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:54,499
       Yeah. I mean, I loved my
        brother and all,

158
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,702
       but one whiff and I
       was all, "See ya!"

159
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,839
      Speaking of which...

160
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,641
              Wait!

161
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,142
     Does the Molt Effect
     happen to ponies, too?

162
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:07,411
    Twilight already asked me
   to leave the castle today.

163
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,414
      If she kicks me out,
    where am I going to live?

164
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,016
    I'm too young to grow up!

165
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,953
   I'm sure you'll find a nice
   hoard of gems to guard

166
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,955
   or a village to terrorize,

167
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,224
     though now that dragons
     and ponies are friends,

168
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,959
         I guess that's
         off the table.

169
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,129
     So no creature is gonna
      want to be around me?

170
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,730
          Oh, I didn't say that.

171
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,365
                That molt stench
                is a magnet for

172
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,469
          predators, Tatzlwurms,
            Hydras, Rocs.

173
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,037
  Dragons are scared of rocks?

174
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,408
         R-O-C-S. Rocs.

175
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,543
       Humongous birds of
       prey that can snack

176
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,780
        on a molting
       dragon like candy.

177
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,182
 [hoarse] So, Twilight's kicking
 me out and the only creatures

178
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,885
  who don't find me disgusting
    want to eat me?

179
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,220
              Seriously, I heard
               none of that.

180
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,656
TWILIGHT'S KICKING ME OUT
AND THE ONLY CREATURES

181
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,526
WHO DON'T FIND ME
DISGUSTING WANT TO EAT ME?

182
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:55,894
                    CONGRATS!

183
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,464
        HEY! IS THIS THE
        SHOUTING CLOSET?

184
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,065
          BECAUSE I'VE
         GOT A FREE DAY

185
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,702
       AND I AM TOTALLY UP
       FOR SOME SHOUTING!

186
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,305
  Also, where is that brussels
 sprouts covered in cotton candy

187
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,542
       smell coming from?

188
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,477
       Because it is
       really interesting...

189
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,384
 I didn't know where else to go.

190
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,685
  I can't take the chance that
   Twilight will kick me out.

191
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,688
     You aren't feeling any
     molt effects, are you?

192
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,494
  <i> When it comes to break outs,</i>
  <i> I've seen all circumstances.</i>

193
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:36,067
   <i> But as for the molt smell,</i>
  <i> let's not take any chances.</i>

194
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,974
Is there anything you
can do to cure me?

195
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,744
   <i> The ailments you have</i>
   <i> aren't something to cure.</i>

196
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,914
     <i> The molt's a condition</i>
     <i> that dragons endure.</i>

197
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,417
      But if anypony sees,
     or smells me right now,

198
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,820
   they'll be so grossed out,
  they'll avoid me forever!

199
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:58,656
   <i> Perhaps we can lessen</i>
   <i> this strange molt-effect,</i>

200
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,893
     <i> The smell is the most</i>
    <i> likely cause I suspect.</i>

201
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,196
[quiet] It's all so
embarrassing.

202
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:08,233
    <i> I know you are speaking</i>
   <i> but I can't hear a thing.</i>

203
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,136
     <i> Are you talking about</i>
  <i> teaching asparagus to sing?</i>

204
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,005
I said it's EMBARRASSING.

205
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,545
   <i> If the goal is to not have</i>
    <i> your friends all depart,</i>

206
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,581
     <i> Perhaps your volume is</i>
     <i> where we should start.</i>

207
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,415
       [stomach rumbling]
          Oh, no...

208
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:35,159
       Rarity: Zecora?
      Hello? Are you there?

209
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,662
       I CAN'T LET RARITY
        SEE ME LIKE THIS.

210
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,564
        PLEASE DON'T LET
       HER KNOW I'M HERE.

211
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,570
            OH, DEAR.

212
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:48,005
     I'M TALKING EVEN LOUDER
    THAN I THOUGHT, AREN'T I?

213
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,342
     <i> I have volume concerns</i>
      <i> today by the scores,</i>

214
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,212
  <i> but it seems that I'm ready</i>
  <i> to help you with yours.</i>

215
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:58,849
ER. I'M SORRY? I CAN'T SEEM
TO HEAR ANYTHING.

216
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,754
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD HELP.

217
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,690
     I HAVE NO IDEA
     WHAT HAPPENED.

218
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:09,494
ONE MINUTE I WAS SEWING
PHOENIX FEATHERS ONTO A DRESS

219
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,931
AND THE NEXT, I COULDN'T
HEAR MY OWN VOICE.

220
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,535
 <i> Ah, the feathers of that bird</i>
  <i> can affect pony's ears.</i>

221
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:21,039
    <i> It's a magic ailment</i>
    <i> I've treated for years.</i>

222
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,874
   I ONLY KNOW YOU'RE TALKING

223
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,143
      BECAUSE YOUR MOUTH IS
       GOING UP AND DOWN.

224
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,815
       Agh! Oh, goodness!

225
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,750
     I hope that incredibly
       pungent odor

226
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,220
      belongs to some sort
      of magical curative!

227
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,825
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT BUSY, BUT
I MUST HAVE MY HEARING BACK.

228
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,761
IT TURNS OUT THAT I TALK
TO MYSELF WHILE I SEW

229
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,232
AND WITHOUT THAT CONVERSATION,
I SIMPLY CAN'T THINK!

230
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,102
     <i> It's a simple cure and</i>
   <i> the directions are clear,</i>

231
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:55,139
     <i> just one or two drops</i>
     <i> in each of your ears.</i>

232
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,275
Ah! Oh, thank you!
You're an ear saver.

233
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:02,980
OH! AND WHILE I AM HERE, DO
YOU HAVE ANY BLEMISH CREAM?

234
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,017
       SPIKE IS HAVING
       SOME SCALE ISSUES.

235
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,653
Spike: YOU
HAVE NO IDEA.

236
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,323
   Ooo! I think I heard something.

237
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,893
  YOUR CURE IS WORKING ALREADY!

238
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,563
    <i> The cream that you</i>
    <i> want is just over here,</i>

239
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:23,135
   <i> It's a popular potion for</i>
    <i> all creatures this year.</i>

240
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,203
Ah, thank you, Zecora.

241
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,511
    I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

242
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:37,582
     BUT I DO THINK YOUR HUT
    COULD USE AN AIRING OUT.

243
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:44,822
     <i> Rarity's gone, there's</i>
     <i> no need to hide,</i>

244
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,525
          [sniff] Agh!

245
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:51,330
     <i> Though I wonder if we</i>
    <i> should continue outside?</i>

246
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,033
   <i> Can't treat your symptoms</i>
   <i> down there on the ground.</i>

247
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,036
     <i> It's safe to come out,</i>
   <i> there's no ponies around.</i>

248
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,670
   I'm not hiding from ponies.

249
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,706
      I'm hiding from THAT!

250
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,787
  Did I forget to mention the
 molt smell attracts predators?

251
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,524
  <i> That's something that would</i>
 <i> have been quite nice to know,</i>

252
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,760
 <i> But it's not worth discussing</i>
<i> right now, we should go!</i>

253
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,204
       It's only after me!

254
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,871
        I'll lead it away
       while you get help!

255
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,744
      This way birdy, bird!

256
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,280
    Molting dragon over here!

257
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,787
       OK, maybe this
       wasn't a good plan!

258
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,157
   <i> You can't hide in a tree,</i>
   <i> you have to come down,</i>

     <i> We stand a much better</i>
    <i> chance on the ground!</i>

260
00:14:58,965 --> 00:14:59,931
             ZECORA!

261
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,566
         Bring her back!

262
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,101
              Agh!

263
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,375
             Oh, Spike, what are
               you doing here?

264
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,311
Rarity, you have
to get out of here;

265
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,346
       there's a giant Roc
        trying to eat me.

266
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,647
        It's got Zecora!

267
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,015
                     Yes. What?

268
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:21,820
     I WAS JUST AT ZECORA'S,
      BUT I'M HEADING BACK.

269
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,656
I CAN'T READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

270
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:29,027
 DOES THIS SAY TWO DROPS ONCE A
  DAY, OR ONE DROP TWICE A DAY?

271
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,597
    Rarity, there's no time!
    We have to get help!

272
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,201
        YES, MY EARS ARE
       COMPLETELY CLOGGED!

273
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,504
      WHY SPIKE, YOUR STONE
       SCALES LOOK WORSE!

274
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,773
       OH, HERE, I PICKED
       UP JUST THE THING.

275
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,307
I--
[screech]

276
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,915
    <i> Oh, I wish you'd escaped</i>
   <i> either claw of this bird,</i>

277
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,152
   <i> but the both of us trapped</i>
   <i> in the same one's absurd!</i>

278
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:55,720
                     WHAT?

279
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,924
        Let my ponies go!

280
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,595
              Whoa!

281
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:09,467
              Agh!

282
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,640
            Aaaaaah!

283
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,981
                 Spike? What are
                   you doing?

284
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,517
If my stone scales
didn't itch so much

285
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,186
and we weren't in
immediate danger,

286
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,756
this would be really
embarrassing.

287
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,057
                     Danger?

288
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,768
   I was headed to Zecora's to
 get some cream for your scales.

289
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,303
    I had no idea you were...

290
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,573
      About to be eaten by
      a giant predator

291
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,141
   attracted to my molt smell?

292
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,742
                    Molt smell?

293
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,679
    Rarity screams: Twilight!

294
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,614
        Was that Rarity?

295
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,899
  And Zecora.

296
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,183
 I tried to save them, but it's
 all I can do to stop scratching

297
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,754
 long enough to dive out of the
 way when that bird attacks!

298
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,829
    THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
    I'VE BEEN IN THE CLUTCHES

299
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,966
  OF A HORRIBLE GIANT CREATURE,
 BUT IT DOESN'T GET ANY EASIER!

300
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,078
          Ah! Finally!

301
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,480
    I didn't think that
    itching would ever stop.

302
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:36,987
        What's happening?

303
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,123
          I can't mo--

304
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,046
       What just happened?

305
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,448
    Did I just sprout wings?

306
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,684
     I JUST SPROUTED WINGS!

307
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,195
  [gasp] I've gotta help them!

308
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,300
              Whoa! Whoa. Whoa!

309
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,913
              Oops!

310
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,217
Spike? How did
you get wings?

311
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,269
                   I don't know!

312
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,820
             But they're pretty
             aweso--WHOOOAAHHHH!

313
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,295
Do you think you can
fly up and distract him

314
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,564
while I work on freeing
Zecora and Rarity?

315
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,838
       Hey, giant chicken!

316
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,041
     If you like dragons so
     much, come and get me!

317
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,118
           Greetings.

318
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,625
             SPIKE!

319
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,438
   <i> I know that the molt</i>
  <i> produced surprising things,</i>

320
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,510
   <i> but I'm glad that the last</i>
  <i> was a new pair of wings!</i>

321
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,513
      YES, AND ALSO I'M
     GLAD YOU'VE GOT WINGS.

322
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,415
                This is amazing.

323
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,417
           I didn't know if
           you'd ever get wings.

324
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,118
           I'm so happy for you.

325
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,954
     Does it have something
     to do with this "molt"

326
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,174
     you were talking about?

327
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,592
[sigh] It's what's
been going on with me.

328
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,527
The break out, the fire burps.

329
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,697
The molt is when dragons get
older and start to change.

330
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,767
I wish I could stop
it, but I can't.

331
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,868
  I should go.

332
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,405
                Go? What are you
                 talking about?

333
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,375
  In the Dragonlands, families
  make molters leave home.

334
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,044
  It's called the Molt Effect.

335
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,614
Well, this isn't the Dragonlands
 and Molt Effect or no,

336
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,950
I don't want you going anywhere.

337
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,918
But I'm growing up.

338
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,887
What if something
even worse happens?

339
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,257
   You're supposed to grow up,
    but you'll always be you.

340
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,593
   And whatever happens, we'll
    get through it together.

341
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:37,334
      Woohoo! Yeah! Look at
       me! Let's go home!

342
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,771
     Uh, I don't need to
    carry you anymore, do I?

343
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,039
         You have wings.

344
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,091
                 They are new!

345
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:44,642
                And I don't
                wanna overdo it.

346
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,950
I can't believe you thought
any of us would send you away

347
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,586
because of some
silly "Molt Effect".

348
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,523
Ah. Even if the symptoms
were slightly unsettling,

349
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,126
and let's face it, the
odor wasn't pleasant,

350
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,161
nopony would stop
caring for you

351
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,997
just because you
were getting older.

352
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,332
Everypony goes
through changes.

353
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,668
Sometimes change
can be wonderful.

354
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,305
Like being able to model
for any length of dress.

355
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,140
  Ah. A bit higher darling, please.

356
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,444
    I'm glad to help, Rarity,
   but don't you think there's

357
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,514
  wonderful things about flying
   that don't involve dresses?

358
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,567
       Of course, darling.

359
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:28,519
 Flying will also be beneficial
 for you to help me with gowns,

360
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,154
     frocks, robes, shifts,
      skirts, minis, maxis.
