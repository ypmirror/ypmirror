        Huh!? Didn't you!?

270
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,110
Well, technically,
I did'em, kind of.

271
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,879
But more technically,
it's not <i>my</i> list.

272
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,114
                 You wrote it!

276

                        Huh?

00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,129
                    Angel?

278
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,830
What's wrong
with her... him?

279
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:13,833
What happened!?

280
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:16,234
                 He's exhausted!

281
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,237
    Fluttershy, I need a jar

282
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,740
      of concentrated
     carrot extract, STAT!

283
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:24,175
Ah! It's locked in
the supply room.

284
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,677
            Where are your keys!?

00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,379
              Uh....

286
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,783
    Any ideas how to get the
    keys out of the elephant

287
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,318
    that's inside the snake?

288
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:39,090
     OK! Point taken. And
     I totally deserve it.

289
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,760
 I did not provide you with the

293
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,570
   The point is Fluttershy is
    trapped in my bunny body

294
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,539
     and if we don't help
     her, maybe none of us
