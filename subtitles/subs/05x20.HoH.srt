[slurping]

177
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,820
[choke]

178
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,100
More rock, please!

179
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,560
Eat up, so we can get to
our Hearth's Warming dolls!

180
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,980
Now that's somethin'
I know all about.

181
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,500
Who wants a Hearth's
Warming doll?

182
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,220
Are you sayin' that rock
is a Hearth's Warming Doll?

183
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,700
Don't be silly, silly.

184
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,900
[crack]

185
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,980
Our dolls are these
little pieces!

186
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,640
Isn't that right, Marble Pie?

187
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,380
Mm-hm.

188
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,560
[clinking]

189
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,540
Our dolls... are rocks?

190
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,700
[crack]

191
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,540
Y'all don't have
traditional crocheted dolls

192
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,060
passed down in your family?

193
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,160
Ohhhh, you're just
a frown factory

194
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,880
because you got a weird rock.

195
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,520
Cheer up! I'm sure
you'll do great in the

196
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,780
Flag-Finding Mission.

197
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,480
What-findin' what-now?

198
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,820
Limestone Pie, you're the judge.

199
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,200
Big Mac? Marble
Pie? You're team 1.

200
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,340
Apple Bloom and
Maud? You're team 2.

201
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Ma? Pa? You're gonna
be with Granny Smith.

202
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,480
Don't think of it as "team old,"
think of it as team three.

203
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,630
And I'm with
Applejack, of course!

204
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,120
Since we might be cousins!

205
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,930
So now that we're all split up,

206
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,600
mind tellin' us
what we're doing?

207
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,740
As everypony knows--

208
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,860
STAY OFF HOLDER'S BOULDER!

209
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,120
Sheesh.

210
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,480
When the three tribes
united to form Equestria,

211
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,040
the first flag was
sewn by Nimble Thimble.

212
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,800
It's tradition to raise a
flag on Hearth's Warming

213
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,980
to celebrate that famous day.

214
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,460
[agreement]

215
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,300
But who gets to put the
flag on Holder's Bolder?

216
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,560
You mean on the flagpole?

217
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,580
No, silly!

218
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,780
It goes on the highest point.
And who's the lucky pony?

219
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,480
Traditionally, it's
the youngest...

220
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,100
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO!

221
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,380
Pinkie Pie, will you please
tell us what's going on?

222
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,440
I'll explain on the way!

223
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,410
Oh!

224
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,080
I still don't understand.

225
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,720
Earlier today, Limestone
Pie hid an obsidian stone.

226
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,340
Whoever finds it gets
to raise the flag!

227
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,580
It's all just so...
complicated. And "rock-based."

228
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,180
Well, how else would we do it?

229
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't know.

230
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,360
I sure hope everypony else
is havin' a better time.

231
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,640
Mmm-hmm.

232
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,140
Eyup.

233
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,560
Mmmmmmm-hmm.

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,460
Eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyup.

235
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,240
So, how'd ya meet
this Iggy fella?

236
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,640
We were chosen by
the pairing stone

237
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,810
and betrothed
within a fortnight.

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,740
The choosing stone decreed
"thou shalt love one another,"

239
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,120
and lo, it was so.

240
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,040
Hoo-wee. I gotsta look into this
oldfangled choosin' stone thing.

241
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,420
Do you reckon it knows
any Apple farmin' hunks?

242
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,880
Indeed so.

243
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,740
What does the rock look like?

244
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,620
It looks like
something that formed

245
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,540
when volcanic lava
cooled quickly.

246
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,300
Oh.

247
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,780
Have you ever wished you
could turn into a rock?

248
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,960
I had a dream once
I was an apple.

249
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,440
We have a lot in common

250
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,120
when it comes to thinking
about turning into things.

251
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Pinkie: FOUND IT!
FOUND IT! FOUND IT!

252
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,680
A picture? I been lookin'
for a real stone, Pinkie Pie.

253
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,100
Um, that would be weird. Do
you know what this means?

254
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,180
I get to raise the flag! And now
it's time to hide the presents!

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,470
Y'all hide your presents?

256
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,560
Of course! What's more fun
than getting a present?

257
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,110
FINDING A PRESENT!

258
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,740
Although most years
nopony finds one.

259
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,480
So nopony gets presents?

260
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,050
Not usually.

261
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,980
So let me get all this straight.

262
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,260
You're only allowed to
eat Rock Soup for dinner.

263
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,640
Then, the pony who finds this
rock gets to raise the flag,

264
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,100
but not really cause you
don't got no flag pole.

265
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,680
And to top it off, you
don't even get presents?

266
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,760
Well, it doesn't sound very
fun when you say it THAT way.

267
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Well, how about
you picture this:

268
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,200
both our families, opening
presents, raising the flag...

269
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,140
Picturing it, loving it!

270
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,980
Goodnight, everypony!

271
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,390
Goodnight, Pinkie Pie!

272
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
We gotta do something, y'all.

273
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,030
Pinkie Pie's family's never
had a real Hearth's Warming.

274
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,100
Is that really what she said?

275
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,500
Well, I'm sure it's
what she meant.

276
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,870
These are their traditions.

277
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,640
Eyup.

278
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,260
I know they have their
traditions and we have ours,

279
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,760
but I just want them to see how
much better theirs could be.

280
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,580
[rooster crows]

281
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,720
Hearth's Warming!

282
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,460
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming!

283
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,320
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Warming!

284
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,780
Hearth's Warming!
Hearth's Wa-

285
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,560
Oh, my, oh my.

286
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,800
What. Happened. To. My. Farm.

287
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,720
It's Hearth's
Warming, Apple style!

288
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,600
We've been doing
everything your way.

289
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,460
I thought we could
mix it up a bit.

290
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,820
Marble Pie, you could raise the
Equestria flag up this pole,

291
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,460
because you're the youngest Pie.

292
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,340
Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up
a meal you'll never forget.

293
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,840
And look, we all get presents
without having to find 'em!

294
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,290
Yeah! This is going to be great!

295
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,700
All the stuff she
said. Right, everypony?

296
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Pinkamina Diane Pie, truly thou
do not favor this madness?

297
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Well, I want to
be one big family.

298
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,640
But what about
what we usually do?

299
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,340
I, um, well? I don't know!
Don't make me choose!

300
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,450
I didn't mean to cause a fuss.

301
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,040
Why don't we just open
presents around the flagpole.

302
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,720
It'll be fun, you'll see.

303
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,550
Excuse me. You planted
your pole on a fault line.

304
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:36,600
[crackling]

305
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,303
[crash]

306
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,180
NOOOOOOOO!

307
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,440
[smash]

308
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,300
[sigh] Oh boy.

309
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,100
You didn't have to
ask them to leave.

310
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,380
They wanted to go.

311
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,380
We don't need anypony forcing
their way into our family.

312
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,100
This was all a
misunderstanding, everypony.

313
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,320
I know Applejack,

314
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,940
and she'd never do
anything bad to anypony.

315
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,940
Look around, Pinkie Pie.

316
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,230
It's gonna take me ages to get
this rock farm back on track.

317
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,500
And how're we gonna
lift Holder's Boulder?

318
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,470
This is all her fault.

319
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,680
Then it's my fault too.

320
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,680
Probably best if we head
back to Sweet Apple Acres.

321
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,820
Maybe in time we'll
be friends again.

322
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,450
But for the now it's best if
we give them a little space.

323
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,760
I wish we didn't have
to. I really like Maud.

324
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,060
She's sweet once you get
to know her. They all are.

325
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,600
Worst Hearth's Warming ever.

326
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,400
Has anypony seen Applejack?

327
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,442
[sobbing]

328
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,780
I really cracked
the corn this time.

329
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,600
I really popped the
piñata this time.

330
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,620
Pinkie Pie?

331
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,680
Ah! What are you
doing here?

332
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,160
What are you
doing here?

333
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,880
I came here to think.

334
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,220
You did? So did I!

335
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,160
[laughing]

336
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,030
I'm too ashamed to
go back up there.

337
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,080
Your family, my family?

338
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,500
They all must think
I'm such a nincompoop.

339
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,120
Aw, no one thinks that.

340
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,520
Pushy, aggressive, mean.
Oh I'm not helping, sorry.

341
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm sorry I forced my
traditions over yours.

342
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,280
I don't want you to have to
choose between the family

343
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,020
you were born into, and the
friends who love you like one.

344
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,090
I really hoped we could be
one big family. I guess not.

345
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,460
Don't say that!

346
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,060
[train whistle]

347
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,400
I wish I could stay but
I have a train to catch.

348
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,740
Hap... hap... happy
