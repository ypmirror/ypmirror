1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,105
 The Tree of Harmony remains one
  of the most powerful sources

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,274
   of magic known to ponydom.

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:11,777
  And though it has been at the
 "root" of Magic and Friendship

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,481
 from the moment it was planted,
its ways are mysterious.

5
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,317
       Almost as if it has
       a mind of its own.

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,653
       Mind? Pfft. It's a tree.

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,889
                A tree that grew
                a castle!

8
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:28,928
  Was that before or after
  Discord made chocolate rain?

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,996
        [whisper] After.

10
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,731
       I'm never going to
       learn Pony history!

11
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:36,502
 You can all show me what you've
 learned on tomorrow's test!

12
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:39,471
 Friendship's effect on the
  course of Equestrian History.

13
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,778
   Remember, study groups are
  both fun AND effective!

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,180
    Sandbar: So.. who wants to
      study together?

15
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,517
With other students?
This is Equestria!

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,053
If you want the real scoop,
there's only one place to go!

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,993
        Hello, oh magical
        Equestrian tree!

18
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,896
Can you tell me <i>everything</i> I
 need to know about friendship?

19
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,484
The Elements of Harmony
grew the tree?

20
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,221
                 [sigh] No. The pillars
                 grew the tree.

21
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,657
 The tree grew the elements. And
  then the box with six locks.

22
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,626
              But our professors
              found six keys

23
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,395
                    and unlocked
                    the box.

24
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,563
              I'm so gonna fail..

25
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,799
                 You guys! Check
                 this out!

26
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,869
    That's a plumbing diagram
    on how to fix a sink.

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,840
    What does that have to do
    with Equestrian History?

28
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,044
  Nothing. I just can't believe
  that's how sinks work!

29
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,312
                   Where's Yona?

30
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:36,555
[chuckle] Apparently, yaks no
love study groups!

31
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,657
          Shhhh. Haha.

32
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,164
           SPIDER! NO!

33
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,306
       Hey Cozy. What are
       you doing here?

34
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,776
 I volunteered to help Professor
 Sparkle organize these books.

35
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,679
      So? Experts on
     Friendship History yet?

36
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,148
    I think I'd be better off
   studying the plumbing book.

37
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,916
    This stuff is impossible.

38
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:11,490
 Oh, come on, Gallus! With good
 friends and solid study habits,

39
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,692
      anything is possible!

40
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,228
   How about you just tell us

41
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,163
      what's on tomorrow's
        test, Professor?

42
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,099
     Yeah! Please! Come on!

43
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,435
   Now hold on a sec. I can't
   give y'all a sneak peek!

44
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,804
 That there wouldn't be honest!

45
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:35,047
  Ahem. Golly, it's so inspiring how
   relaxed you all are about

46
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:39,018
 studying friendship
 considering your disadvantage.

47
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,286
      What cute pony mean?

48
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,056
       Just consider where
       you all came from!

49
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,492
  If Sandbar hadn't sacrificed
   so much of his time

50
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,962
   to get you up to speed? Who
   knows how behind you'd be?

51
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,932
          That's not--

52
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,436
    I mean, growing up as a
    love-starved changeling!

53
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,706
  Or hiding underwater from an
  evil king all those years!

54
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:04,343
   Trusting any creature
    must be so hard for you!

55
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,579
   And Griffons never want
   to be around any creature.

56
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,014
      Even other griffons!

57
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,950
    And dragons are so
     fierce compared to us.

58
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,786
     There must be days you
     can't wait to get away

59
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,889
    from all us cute ponies.

60
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,359
       Everypony know "yaks
      think yaks are best".

61
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,027
       Making friends with
       any other creature

62
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,964
   must seem like a step down.

63
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,599
     It's just so impressive
     how you keep trying

64
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,201
    to understand friendship,

65
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,736
      even though it isn't
      in your nature.

66
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,675
   Oh! I'll let you borrow my
  notes! It's what friends do!

67
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,910
       I'll be right back!

68
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,380
We should get
back to studying...

69
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:55,627
Could you stop that clicking!?
I'm trying to focus.

70
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:56,862
                    Dude...

71
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,765
What? We have a test. I
don't know every detail

72
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,834
about every adventure the
professors went on like you do.

73
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,103
        That's why we're
       studying together.

74
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,573
    Right. To help us
   "disadvantaged" creatures.

75
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,642
       Yona confused. Why
       we all upset?

76
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,387
        I only glanced at
       that plumbing book,

77
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,223
   but I'm pretty sure this
   isn't supposed to be here.

78
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,494
       What are you doing?

79
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:32,531
  Dragon. Strange Magical Cave.
  What do you think I'm doing?

80
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,848
 Did we know this was down here?

81
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,918
    I don't think anypony
    knows this is down here.

82
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,590
            Welcome.

83
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,192
              Headmare Twilight?
             Where are we?

84
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,095
      Where you need to be.

85
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,063
         Uh. Yona confused.

86
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:09,635
It is as I feared. You are not
one. What has happened?

87
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,871
   We were studying Friendship's
   effect on History but then...

88
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,942
Since friendship just isn't in
our nature, what's the point?

89
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,112
   You do not believe
  friendship is in your nature?

90
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,814
     That is NOT ACCEPTABLE!

91
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,118
      Our headmare is
       glowing, you guys!

92
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,354
        What is going on!?

93
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,056
   We should probably get back
    to studying for the test.

94
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,894
A test. Yes.

95
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,063
     By sunrise, this
      door will be closed.

96
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,832
     Finish the test before
      then and you may go.

97
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,535
      Fail the test and
       here you will stay.

98
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,543
              Huh?

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,212
              Huh?

100
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,182
              Huh?

101
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,191
               OH!

102
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,829
     Mt. Aris!?

103
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,964
Headmare Twilight
sent me home?

104
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,301
      Wait. Am I suspended?

105
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,936
             Hello?

106
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,471
         Anygriff here?

107
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:20,705
              Hmm.

108
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,940
      They must be topside.

109
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:24,476
              Huh?

110
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:25,811
               Oh!

111
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,314
              Agh!

112
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,084
               Ah!

113
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,523
         THE STORM KING?

114
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,958
           He's BACK?

115
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,129
       Big room. No exits.

116
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,264
            Big deal.

117
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,471
            Not cool..

118
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,578
        Nothing for yaks
        to be afraid of.

119
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,616
    Just empty cave. Nothing
    in here can hurt...

120
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,340
 ...Yona!

121
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,259
   Ugh. Things like this just don't
   happen in the Dragonlands.

122
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,930
 -Huh?
-And I told her she was the
cutest pony of all ponies!

123
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:21,700
Oooh! Aren't you just
the most ADORABLE thing?

124
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:22,668
          Come join us!

125
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,805
   No. On so many levels, no.

126
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:32,644
              Huh?

127
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,280
    Come sit by me and let's
    compliment each other!

128
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,148
              Agh!

129
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,554
[gasp] Why do you look
like that?

130
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,722
               What do you mean?

131
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,856
We all look the same.

132
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:45,958
             Not me.

133
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,995
Of course not you,
Your Majesty.

134
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,097
We'll go drain the love from
those pathetic ponies

135
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,566
in Ponyville just
as you ordered!

136
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:59,337
           [gasp] NO!

137
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,610
               Oh, thank HEAVENS
               we've found you!

138
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,913
There's an emergency
and we need YOU, Sandbar!

139
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,784
 Ah! My first friendship adventure!

140
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,352
               Yes! Count me in!

141
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,620
               I've been waiting
               for this--

142
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,255
               Wait. The others!

143
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,024
We don't need <i>them</i>!

144
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,192
We need you! Come on!

145
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,204
        Come on, Gallus.

146
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,473
        Get it together.

147
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,807
          Deep breaths.

148
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,446
       Ah...ah...ah choo!

149
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:50,322
  OK, if this is a test,
  there's got to be a way out.

150
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,759
      It's just a puzzle...
      that will squash you

151
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,295
          if you don't
         figure it out.

152
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,639
             Ah ha!

153
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,540
          No pressure.

154
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,047
              Oops!

155
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:34,778
              Grrrr.

156
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,004
 Look. I have to get out of here
 and find my friends,

157
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,806
   so just tell me what I have
    to do to pass this test.

158
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,442
   I'm not afraid of anything.

159
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,310
Um. I don't know.

160
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,513
Seems like she's afraid to be
cute and adorable, doesn't it?

161
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,382
             Or maybe she's just
             afraid to admit

162
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,353
              she <i>likes</i> being
              cute and adorable.

163
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,422
   Mm hm.

164
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,423
         Just this once.

165
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,227
        [ahem] May I have
        some tea, please?

166
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,365
Oh, but you can't have tea
if you aren't dressed for it!

167
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,534
       OK. But let's keep
        this between us.

168
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,383
        Ah!
        [crash]

169
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,800
         YONA NEED HELP!

170
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,970
      WHERE YONA'S FRIENDS
      WHEN YONA NEEDS THEM?

171
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,020
             Huh!?

172
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,781
     Yona no mean to scream...

173
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,317
    Yona love making friends.

174
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,252
       Spiders... friends?

175
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,892
  Wait. What little spider say?

176
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,933
                   What happened
                      to you?

177
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:16,822
What happened to you?

178
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:21,739
               You never saw ANY
               of that, got it?

179
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,013
Maybe the others got out
already and we're the last ones?

180
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,349
Yeah. That totally seems like
something they would do...

181
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,653
  Hmph. Any other dragon or griffon
  would save themselves

182
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,688
 and get out of this crazy cave.

183
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,924
Guess we aren't just <i>any</i>
dragon and griffon anymore.

184
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,961
     Guess not. You go that way.
     I'll check over there.

185
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,039
      Wait. I really should
     find my friends.

186
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:59,644
Darling, it was so generous
of you to take the time

187
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,380
to teach those other
creatures about friendship.

188
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,984
But.. if you're going to join us
and do something that really

189
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:10,255
makes a difference, we need to
know where your loyalty lies.

190
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:14,792
     You do want to impress
     us, don't you, Sandbar?

191
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:23,368
              Huh?

192
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,036
            Ocellus?

193
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,338
   Go away.

194
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,474
   We're still in those weird
    caves beneath the school!

195
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,042
  We've got to get out of here!

196
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,581
        [gasp] Chrysalis!
        Where's Ocellus!?

197
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,051
      [sob] It's me! I'm HIDEOUS!

198
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,022
                      Hello!?

199
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:47,592
        Where are--Whoa!

200
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,896
        SHHHHH! The Storm
       King will hear you!

201
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,197
         The Storm King?

202
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,465
        He was defeated.

203
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,667
        We're still under
        the school.

204
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,402
        This is all just
        some crazy test!

205
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,874
     OK, that's horrifying.

206
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,411
    I can't find any
    hippogriffs or seaponies!

207
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,145
   They must all be captured!

208
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,784
   Gallus! Get back down here!

209
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,629
         It's not real!

210
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,031
           Yes, it is!

211
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,299
  He's back and I'm never going
  to see another sunset

212
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,202
     or fly through a cloud
     bank or study plumbing!

213
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,638
     He's going to take
     away everything I love...

214
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,842
     I'm going to be trapped
     down here forever!

215
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,911
       I'm afraid of
       being trapped too.

216
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,479
          I'm scared of
          small spaces.

217
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,580
                     Really?

218
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,615
              Yeah...

219
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,151
    And I was stuck in a
    room that kept shrinking.

220
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,554
 But I realized I had to face my
  fear and I found the way out.

221
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,157
This is your test. He
isn't really here.

222
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,927
         But what if he is..!?

223
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,463
    Then tell him exactly
   what you think of him!

224
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,235
             H-h-hey!

225
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,537
           Storm King!

226
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,439
       You're nothing but
        a big ole bully

227
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,943
        with a silly name
       and a goofy crown!

228
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:16,481
 You thought you could scare us
 into doing whatever you wanted!

229
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:21,019
  But we learned that together
  we're STRONGER than you!

230
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,887
        And now that
        we're rid of you,

231
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,625
  we're gonna SOAR THROUGH THE
    SKY and go on adventures

232
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:32,396
       and NEVER GIVE YOU
      ANOTHER THOUGHT. EVER!

233
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,902
              Haha!

234
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,137
            I did it!

235
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,138
           I told him!

236
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,776
       OK, hug time later.

237
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,444
      We still have to get
      back to the library.

238
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,780
            You're a changeling.

239
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,149
               Just.. change back.

240
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,550
            I can't.

241
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,221
Maybe my past
was so horrible,

242
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,991
it's still inside me just
waiting to come out again!

243
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,659
       That's ridiculous.

244
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,628
 That's not who you are anymore.

245
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,896
         You've changed.

246
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,299
Maybe we can't really
change THAT much.

247
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,435
       [mumbling] I like cute, silly stuff!

248
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,070
I'm sorry, what?

249
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,506
                I LIKE cute,
                silly stuff!

250
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,910
 But ever since school started,
  I've realized that sometimes

251
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,145
 I kinda don't mind cute stuff.

252
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:28,252
    If a dragon like me can
    admit she likes... tea parties,

253
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,955
                 that's proof we
                 CAN change.

254
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:34,058
 I was gonna invite you to a
  top-secret tea party with me,

255
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,427
       but if you want
       to stay down here...

256
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,030
      Oh, no! I wanna come!

257
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,500
                  I thought that
                  might work.

258
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,968
              Come on, let's go!

259
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,539
                    Where's Yona
                    and Sandbar?

260
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,241
     The way out
     is closing!

261
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,876
We aren't leaving
without them.

262
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,146
       YONA FIND YOU GUYS!

263
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,323
               Argh!

264
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,684
Hey, Yona. Who's
your.. spider army?

265
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,721
  Yona always scared of spiders
   but then Yona meet Spindle!

266
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,626
     Yona realize no
      reason to be afraid!

267
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,728
    Spiders and yak friends!

268
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,132
   So Yona ask new friends for
   help finding old friends!

269
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,802
   Do you think your new friends
   can help us find Sandbar?

270
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,341
    Of all the strange things
   that have happened tonight,

271
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,510
  that's the strangest, right?

272
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,249
           OK. Enough!

273
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,283
     I'm not going anywhere
       without my friends.

274
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,622
       So you don't care about
       anypony but your friends?

275
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,191
                  Are you really
                  that selfish?

276
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,528
Honestly, you really are
such a disappointment.

277
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,263
  I've always looked up to you.

278
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,831
   You would never turn
    your back on each other.

279
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,433
        And that's what
        makes you strong.

280
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,368
     And now I have a group
     of friends that I think

281
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,237
         is every bit as
        amazing as yours.

282
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,639
     If I have to give up on
     them to make you proud,

283
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,574
   then you aren't the
   ponies I thought you were.

284
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,409
       I don't care if
        I disappoint you.

285
00:17:58,611 --> 00:17:59,878
       You disappoint me.

286
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:07,318
Did you just tell our professors
you were disappointed in them!?

287
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,688
Something tells me those
weren't actually our professors.

288
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,358
   Besides, they tried to get
   between me and my friends!

289
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,761
     That's all very sweet.

290
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,829
        Now can we please
        get out of here?

291
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,209
    You! You're not Headmare
   Twilight, are you?

292
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:36,180
                [gasp] You're the Tree
                 of Harmony!

293
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,418
   The Tree of Harmony turned
     into a sparkly version

294
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,687
 of our headmare to talk to us?

295
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,923
 Did I miss a chapter in class?

296
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,226
Like all living things,
I change as I grow.

297
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,828
As I have grown, so
have my abilities.

298
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,464
                I'm a bit rusty
                on Pony history,

299
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,034
  but since when does the Tree
  of Harmony trap creatures

300
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,003
      in a cave with their
      biggest fears!?

301
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:01,606
You chose what you saw
in my roots, not me.

302
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:06,011
       [gasp] Our friendship got
       us past our fears!

303
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,347
You were more concerned with
each other's well being

304
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,215
than your own.

305
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,683
You were strong when
your friends were weak.

306
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,219
You let each other in and
showed that you would be there

307
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,788
for each other,
no matter what.

308
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,357
Friendship IS in
your nature.

309
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:29,266
We just learned a friendship
lesson from a tree, didn't we.

310
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,271
        You're all right!

311
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,239
       I came back with my
       notes and saw this

312
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,974
         and didn't know
         what to think.

313
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,910
        We're better than
         all right!

314
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,779
      We just got tested by
      the Tree of Harmony!

315
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,315
     And we totally passed!

316
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,418
                 The Tree of
                  Harmony? Here?

317
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,687
Yeah! Well. Below here.

318
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,723
        Under the school!

319
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,058
 We found this and went down and
 met the Tree and Gallus was all

320
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,260
       "friendship is NOT
      in our nature"

321
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,028
and the tree was like WHAT!?

322
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,530
And it tested us!

323
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,199
        Long story short.

324
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,601
  Friendship IS in our nature.

325
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,336
        The Tree said so.

326
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,672
I guess we should tell somepony
there's a giant magical hole

327
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,774
in the library.

328
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,243
         [clang] Or not.

329
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,578
          We have to tell our
          professors about this!

330
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,546
            They won't believe--

331
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:16,481
           You can't!

332
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,782
                    Why no?

333
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,718
     Because... it's my fault!

334
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,054
      You were all getting
      along so well

335
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:26,157
      and I felt left out.
      I was jealous.

336
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,928
And it upset you so much the
Tree of Harmony had to test you!

337
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,798
        Oh! I'm gonna get
       expelled for sure!

338
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,767
        [sobbing] Please don't tell
       anypony about this!

339
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,102
   Especially the Professors!

340
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,003
     PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!

341
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:39,871
OK!

342
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:44,174
    [yawn] I'm actually too tired
    to do anything right now.

343
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,544
Yeah. But we can't
go to sleep.

344
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,946
We'll miss the test.

345
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,214
        The TEST! I
         almost forgot.

346
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,351
      We're all gonna fail.

347
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,026
What if I tell Professor Sparkle
I needed help organizing

348
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,562
  these books and you were all
  kind enough to pitch in?

349
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,063
   I'll get you an extension!

350
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:10,268
[yawn] Thanks, Cozy.
That's nice of you.

351
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,738
       I'm just so sorry I
       caused all of this.

352
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,506
    You're such good friends.

353
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,276
  I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

354
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,879
         Mmmm. No prob.

355
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:24,315
   Friendship is.... Zzzzzzz.

356
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,717
              You get some rest.

357
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,952
           Don't give any of
           this another thought.

358
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,088
      Just let Cozy take
       care of everything....
