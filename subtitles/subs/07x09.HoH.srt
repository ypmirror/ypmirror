    You can thank Applejack.

        She lit'rally did

  I don't think that word means

   It means soooo much to me,

Simplicity is the
keynote of true elegance.

That is why I vote
for Inky Rose.

           Sorry, but I couldn't

00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,283
              They all did great

472
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,885
        they all deserve to win.

473

   I told you your perspective
      would be beneficial.

       Is.. this one of your
      new designs, Rarity?

           It's, uh...

477
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,464
  the form is reminiscent of...

478
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,700
       I mean, it conjures
         up images of...

479

481
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:16,040
          No, I totally
          messed that one up.

482
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,341
          It's ghastly.

483
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,375
             Horrid.

484
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,144
      Absolutely terrible!

485
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,446
             Oh, thank goodness.

486
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,550
