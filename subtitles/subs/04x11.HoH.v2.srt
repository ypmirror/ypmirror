Hey! Who keeps throwing away
these perfectly good balloons?

181
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,030
That joker's
up to somethin'.

182
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,470
And whatever it is, we're
gonna keep it as far away

183
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,640
from Twilight and Princess
Cadance as possible.

184
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,900
<i>(beeps)</i>

185
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,230
You're right.

186
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,780
We promised we wouldn't let
anything ruin their visit.

187
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,560
Although I do so wish that
"anything" had turned out

188
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,740
to be something else.

189
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,820
Did I hear you two talking about
Princess Cadance's visit

190
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,990
with Princess Twilight?

191
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,420
Maybe.

192
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,980
Fluttershy had mentioned
that those two

193
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,030
were getting together today.

194
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,410
How wonderful for them both.

195
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,320
It is so rare that those two
get to see one another.

196
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,210
I don't know about you, but I
sometimes wonder how close

197
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,340
they could actually be.

198
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,710
<i>All those years apart</i>
<i>before being reunited?</i>

199
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,940
They're plenty close.

200
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,690
And if they're not, this rare
opportunity to focus

201
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,130
on their friendship will
certainly bring them closer.

202
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,330
Unless...

203
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,370
Don't even
think about it.

204
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,930
They mustn't be disturbed.

205
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,280
Disturb them?

206
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,500
Why I wouldn't dream of it.

207
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,040
Not when I have two such
dear friends of my own

208
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,980
who have already offered
to take care of me.

209
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,690
And at such peril.

210
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,550
This flu of mine is highly...

211
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,420
AAAACHOO!

212
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,720
Contagious.

213
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,690

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,790
Oh no! I've gotten
you both sick.

216
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,680
Whomever shall I turn to
now in my time of need?

217
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,320
<i>(evil chuckle)</i>

218
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,680
Twilight: A whole day to

219
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,170
What could be better?

220
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,400
Absolutely nothing!

221
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,200
Is that the candlestick
he used to light the way

222
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,180
when he was exploring the
caverns of Maretania?

223
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,750
It sure is.

224
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,560
Oh, I can't believe I'm getting
to see it in real life!

225
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,620
<i>(rattle)</i>

226
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,910

ACHOO!

229
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,730
Discord! What are
you doing here?

230
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,680
Oh, dear, dear Princesses,
I'm sorry to say I'm sick.

231
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,910
<i>(cough)</i>

232
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,620
Blue Flu.

233
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,160
Blue Flu?

234
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,600
I fear I've already given it
to poor Applejack and Rarity.

235
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,220
Achoo!

236
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,530
Magic health bubble.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,970
Good thinking.

238
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,170
Indeed.

239
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,990
How would Twilight
nurse me back to health

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,560
if she was sick, too?

241
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,620
You will be letting
me stay at your place

242
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,290
until I'm all
better, won't you?

243
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,770
Stay?

244
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,950
With me?

245
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,590
Uh, now is not
really the best time.

246
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,490
Though I'm sure you
already knew that.

247
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,330
But taking in the sick
and the desperate:

248
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,280
isn't that what
Fluttershy would do?

249
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,270
Isn't "helping" something
that friends do for friends?

250
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,220
Unless, of course,

251
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,060
you're really saying that
you're not my friend.

252
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,500
No. That is not
what I'm saying.

253
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,200
Oh, how elated I
am to hear that.

254
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,680
Shall the three of us
head back to your place?

255
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,380
I don't want to get
anypony else sick.

256
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,650
(sigh)I guess we
don't have much choice.

257
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,330

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,210
I think you can manage.

261
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,880
Oh. poo

262
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,050
Need anything else?

263
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,480
Just knowing that I have
a good friend like you

264
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,030
to take care of me has
made me feel better already.

265
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,760
I'll be fine here on my own.

266
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,960
Oh. Just before you go.

267
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,120
Just a little, small request.

271

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,790

We're listening.

424
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,840
Well, I was in my
thinking tree.

425
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,680
That's where I do most of
my really deep thinking.

426
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,960
I was there and I
said to myself I said.

427
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,970
Discord, your friend Twilight
says that she's your pal,

428
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,650
but she never writes and she
never pops in for a visit.

429
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,040
I don't even know
where you live.

430
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,460
Now that she's a Princess,

431
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,970
<i>maybe she's decided that</i>
<i>she's too good for you.</i>

432
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,320
I have never considered
myself too good--

433
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,640
But how was I supposed to know

434
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,690
for sure that I'm
truly still friends

435
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,050
with one of the most
important ponies around?

436
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,400
I'm not more--

437
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,380
By seeing if you would go
to the ends of Equestria

438
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,030
for me, of course!

439
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,940
Which you did. Literally.

440
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,000
Congratulations, Twilight,
you passed my friendship test!

You love passing tests.

444
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,210
It's not because my little exam
put a damper on your visit

445
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,690
with Princess Cadance, is it?

446
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,950
Made it so that there was
no time for you two

447
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,700
to focus on your friendship?

448
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,640
You didn't put a damper
on our visit at all.

449
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,360
I didn't?
He didn't?

450
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,380
Spending the day at the
Starswirl the Bearded exhibit

451
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,440
would have been more
relaxing, but to be honest,

452
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,660
relaxation is the
last thing I need.

453
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,860
It is?

454
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,410
Don't get me wrong.

455
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,870
Life in the Crystal
Empire is wonderful,

456
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,720
but it's become a
little... predictable.

457
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,590
I enjoy a little
excitement now and then.

458
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,220
Getting to face all
these challenges today

459
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,550
was just what I needed.

460
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,060
And facing them with you just
made me realize even more

461
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,090
how lucky I am to have
somepony like you as a friend.

other very often,

463
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,300
but I know you'll always
be there when I need you.

464
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,060
Just like she was
there for you, Discord.

465
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,050
Yes. She's a
real sweetheart.

466
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,380

way I expected.

But in the end, I realized that

even the most chaotic day can
end up being a great experience

477
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,810
Wouldn't you agree, Discord?

478
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,250
Yes, Twilight.

479
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,360
I don't wanna go sayin'
you got what you deserved.

480
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,590

trouble saying it.

He's learned his lesson.

484
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,620
Isn't that right,
my little patient?

485
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,610
I'm so glad that you're back
from your trip, Fluttershy.

486
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,850
Just your presence here is
making me feel so much better.

487
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,710
I was just wondering.

488
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,700
Could I trouble you for
just one more thing?

489
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,720
No!

490
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,070
What?

491
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,600
I was simply going to ask for
a teeny tiny glass of water.
