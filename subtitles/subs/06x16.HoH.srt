00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,840
I hope Shining Armor
and Princess Cadance

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,980
don't think it's too
soon for me

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,070
to come back to the Crystal
Empire for a visit.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,540
But I just know Flurry Heart's
grown so much already.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,360
I wonder if I'll
even recognize her.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,440
She's the only baby
they have, Twilight.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,110
I think it'll be pretty easy
to figure out who she is.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,460
Mm.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,420
Sorry, I know you want to visit
your niece as much as possible

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,220
and I'm excited to
see Sunburst again.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,940
I just don't want
to fall behind

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,060
on my friendship
lessons back home.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,400
Starlight, your work in
Ponyville isn't going anywhere.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,100
Besides, I think we
all know you can learn

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,100
about friendship
anywhere, right Spike?

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,920
Spike? Who's Spike?

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,740
[Pfft] Uh you're
Spike, Spike.

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,110
And why are you
dressed like that?

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,320
Guys! You're blowing my cover.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,780
How'd you even
know it was me?

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,300
Because you're YOU-- in
a coat, hat, and glasses.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,240
Also, we're the
only ones here.

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,460
Right.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,280
Spike, why do you
need a disguise?

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,560
The last time we came
to the Crystal Empire.

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,420
there was a lot going
on with the new baby

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,320
and the Crystalling,

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,040
but I still got
mobbed in the street.

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,120
I wouldn't say "mobbed."

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,740
And this is just
a family visit.

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,360
I wouldn't want the presence of
"Spike the Brave and Glorious"

32
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,380
to turn it into
some kind of circus.

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,380
We get it. The Crystal
Ponies adore you.

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,260
He did save the
Empire. Twice.

35
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,260
But still, I don't
think your presence

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
will turn our visit
into a circus.

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,140
Not if I find the right
disguise, it won't.

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,000
Uh disguise or not, Spike, I
don't think you need to worry

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,140
about being mobbed.
Nopony's here.

[bird screech]

42
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,480
Spike: It's like a ghost town.

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,660
Twilight: I've got a bad
feeling about this.

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,180
Yeah, this is weird.

46
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,940
I guess I don't need
the disguise after all.

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,560
[cheering]

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,260
It's Spike, the
Brave and Glorious!

49
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,200
He's come to save
us yet again!

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,780
[cheering] Spike! Spike! Spike!

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,100
Save you from what?

52
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,300
Yeah. What's going on?

53
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,000
Why was everypony hiding?

54
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,040
It sure looks like Princess
Twilight and her pupil.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
But how can we be sure?

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,560
We can't. Either one of them
could be the-- you know.

57
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,320
[gasp] What if this isn't
[gasp] the real Spike!?

58
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,180
EVERYPONY RUN!

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,360
Awww!

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,160
OK. Something strange
is definitely going on.

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
Ugh, you think?

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,780
Who goes there?

63
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,340
Um... you don't recognize
the Princess of Friendship?

64
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,500
Of course we recognize her.

65
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,060
But that doesn't
mean it's really her.

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,200
It's OK, guys.
They're with me.

67
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,500
And any friend of Spike
the Brave and Glorious

68
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,600
is a friend of the Crystal
Empire, am I right?

69
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,160
Huh. It does look like him.

70
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,960
Well, it would, wouldn't it?

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm sorry, but we'll need to see
some proof of identification.

72
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,340
<i> We'll take care of</i>
<i> things from here.</i>

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,710
Oh Cadance, thank
goodness! What's going on?

74
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,240
We can explain, Twilly
if it really is you.

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,960
"Sunshine, Sunshine--"

76
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,200
"--Lady bugs awake! Clap your
hooves and do a little shake!"

77
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,780
It's OK, everypony.
It's her.

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,420
Of course it's her.
What's all this about?

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,760
A Changeling's been
spotted nearby.

80
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,220
A Changeling!?

81
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,160
That's not good.

82
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,580
No. It's not.

83
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,180
After Queen Chrysalis took
my place at our wedding

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,400
and invaded Canterlot
with her army of minions,

85
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,820
we're not taking any chances.

86
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,900
Changelings feed off of love,

87
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,840
and ever since Flurry
Heart's Crystalling,

88
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,180
the Empire is filled with more
love than anywhere in Equestria.

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,300
It's possible they've
come for the baby.

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,060
That's why we've posted the
extra guards and why we're--

91
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,460
--checking
everypony's identity.

92
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm sorry for all of this.

93
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,980
Flurry Heart's really been
looking forward to seeing you.

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,660
[gurgle]

95
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Oh! She's gotten so big!

96
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,180
Starlight and I will do whatever
we can to help protect her.

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,050
To be honest, having you
here is already a big relief.

98
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,440
[whispering]

99
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,980
The Royal Guards were
wondering if Spike,

100
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,120
the Brave and Glorious,

101
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,220
would like to join in the
search for the Changeling.

102
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,730
Really?

103
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,760
Uh, I don't know if that's
such a good idea, Spike.

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
It sounds dangerous.

105
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,620
Come on, Twilight. This is
Spike the Brave and Glorious

106
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,160
you're talking to. Have you ever
known me to run from danger?

107
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,780
Ummmm...

108
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,700
He'll be safe with our guards.

109
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,320
Or will your guards
be safe with me?

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,980
[sigh]

111
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,180
Spike, the Brave and Glorious.

112
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,200
You've faced the evil
Changelings before.

113
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,300
What can you tell us?

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,860
Oh. Um. Well, they are
Changelings, so they can change.

115
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,640
Do you hear that? These monsters
can look like any of us,

116
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,580
so be on guard, guards.
Even more than normal.

117
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,780
And they could be anywhere.

118
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,620
So we should cover as
much ground as possible.

119
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,620
You, search that way!

120
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,320
[whoosh]

121
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,260
And you search that way!

122
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,460
[whoosh]

123
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,660
And I'll just search
here, I guess.

124
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,600
Not many places to hide.

125
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,390
Unless that rock
is a Changeling.

126
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,160
OK, "rock", how do I know
you're really a rock?

127
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,600
Hmm not talking, huh?
Well, you can't fool me.

128
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,040
Whoa!

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,810

130
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,520

131
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,840
Whew. [kissing noises]

132
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,420
OK. Maybe it's time Spike
the Brave and Glorious

133
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,840
went back to, ah,
protect those guards.

134
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,400
[surprised yell]

135
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Phew. Just my reflection.

136
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,560
Huh?

137
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,940
Ha hah! Hmm, just my
imagination, I guess.

138
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,820
[thud]

139
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,100
AUGGGGGHHHH!

140
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,340
Ch-ch-ch-changeling!!

141
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,380
No, wait! Come back!

142
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,840
AAAAHHHHHH!

143
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,100
AAAAHHHHHH!

144
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,830
This is unexpected.

145
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,580
The ice is pretty slippery.

146
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,760
I wouldn't want you to
get hurt because of me.

147
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,980
You... saved me?

148
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,120
It's OK. I know you
don't want to be friends.

149
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,920
Wait!

150
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,880
I don't understand. Changelings
are supposed to be evil, right?

151
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,360
Evil? Oh, not me. All I've
ever wanted is a friend.

152
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,700
From the moment I first split
my egg in the nursery hive.

153
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,500
[hissing]

154
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,340
I was part of the
attack on Canterlot

155
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,500
during the Royal Wedding.

156
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,017
But I'd never seen true
friendship like that,

157
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,800
and I couldn't just steal
it and feed on its love.

158
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,580
I wanted to share it!

159
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,420
After that, I knew I couldn't
live with my kind anymore.

160
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,320
I set off looking for
love to share. But--

161
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,940
But what?

162
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,920
I'm starving!

163
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,380
And there's so much love in
the Crystal Empire right now.

164
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,760
It's what drew me here,
but it's driving me crazy!

165
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,840
That would be from
the Royal Crystalling.

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,100
It's pretty much a giant
outpouring of light and love

167
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,800
for a new baby.

168
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,210
[hiss] Oh, sorry.
I'm just so hungry.

169
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
If I had a friend, maybe the
love we shared could sustain me,

170
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,540
but I don't think the Crystal
Ponies want to be friends.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,040
What if I told you there was
somepony they respect and admire

172
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,040
so much, he could convince
them to give it a try?

173
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,780
If only that were true!

174

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,460
Thank you.

342
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,020
On behalf of the Crystal Empire,
I would like to extend my hoof

343
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,000
in friendship and I am
sure all of my subjects

344
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
are eager to do the same.

345
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:48,279
[cheers]! Yay!

346
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,280
Welcome to the Crystal
Empire, Thorax.

347
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,900
I'm sorry we didn't take the
time to get to know you.

348
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,020
Maybe we can change that now.

349
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,480
That'd be so amazing! I want
to know all about friendship.

350
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,990
And maybe one day I can
take that knowledge back

351
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,260
to the Changeling Kingdom.

352
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,820
If my kind learned how to
create love for one another,

353
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
maybe they wouldn't have
to take it from others!

354
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,560
To Spike the Brave and Glorious!

355
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:21,812
[cheers]

356
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,880
Looks like you were
right after all.

357
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,960
Right about what?

358
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,960
Friendship lessons
can happen anywhere.
