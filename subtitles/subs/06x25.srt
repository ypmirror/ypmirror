1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa ahhhhhh!

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,855
Agh!

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,150
Well, we don't all
have magical horns.

4
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:17,710
I've been meaning to
move these older books

5
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:19,650
to my "reference"
section for a while.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,650
Gotta keep the new
books front and center!

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,460
Thank you both for
your help.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,095
Are you kidding? After
all you've done for me?

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,615
This is the least
I can do.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,110
Oh please, I haven't
done that much.

11
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:33,425
Nah. You just taught me
the value of friendship.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,200
Not much at all.

13
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,355
I may have offered
some guidance,

14
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,985
but you are responsible
for the pony you've become.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,085
I'm proud to call you my
student AND my friend.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,305
Now, we just need to
get rid of these boxes.

17
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:47,710
Spike, can you... Spike?

18
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:49,165
What's that?

19
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:52,390
Is it a bird?

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,035
Is it a parasprite?

21
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:56,685
It's... It's... INCOMING!!

22
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:07,910
Oh. I usually get
letters by dragon.

23
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,915
It IS the fastest
way to get mail.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,790
For me? Who would be
sending me a letter?

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,500
It's the ponies
from my old village.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,835
Are they in danger?

27
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:25,275
Are they upset with you?

28
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,300
No. It's worse.

29
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:30,610
They've invited me to the
annual sunset festival!

30
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,790

By YayPonies
There wasn't even a muffin in that letter :/
https://yp1.yayponies.eu

31
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,790
Uh, hey there,
everypony.

32
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,550
Uh. Hey Starlight. What
are you doing here?

33
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:36,060
I... I was invited. To
the Sunset Festival?

34
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,175
Uh yeah. But we didn't think
you'd actually show up.

35
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:43,455
You didn't think we really
wanted you here did you?

36
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,820
But I apologized. I thought
everything was fine.

37
00:02:57,805 --> 00:03:00,690
PLEASE. Stop. STOP!

38
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,680
What happened? Is
anypony there?

39
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,500
Princess Luna? What
are you doing here?

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,985
Dreams are my domain,
Starlight Glimmer.

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,570
I am here because
you need me to be.

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,370
Oh! It's only a dream.

43
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:28,670
It may only be a dream, but
the feelings in it are real.

44
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,820
Great. So I guess
I'm more afraid

45
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,860
of going back
to the village

46
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:35,455
than I thought.
What do I do now?

47
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,750
I have been helped
time and time again

48
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,020
by six very
special ponies.

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
They helped me
overcome my past.

50
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,730
You are fortunate to
have them as friends.

51
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,550
I suggest you share your
concerns with them.

52
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,905
I see much of myself in
you, Starlight Glimmer

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,745
and I can tell you from
personal experience

54
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,005
that things do
indeed get better.

55
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:02,515
Huh?

56
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:09,455
... and Princess Luna
said I should tell you all

57
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,810
how I was feeling.
So, there it is.

58
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm afraid to go back to the
village for the celebration.

59
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,450
But why, darling? You went back
to apologize; they accepted.

60
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:23,435
Everypony has moved on!

61
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:27,400
But have they? They don't really
know how much I've changed.

62
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,245
Or even worse, maybe I
haven't changed as much

63
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,475
as I think I have!

64
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,555
TRUST ME. You are a totally
different pony now.

65
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,885
I mean...you were
pretty awful!

66
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,100
RAINBOW DASH!

67
00:04:39,315 --> 00:04:42,200
WHAT?! She WAS!
It's a compliment!

68
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,065
I don't think they would
have sent the invitation

69
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,730
if they didn't want
you to come.

70
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,090
I'm sure they'd be
happy to see you.

71
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:52,545
And getting an invitation
to a party and NOT GOING?

72
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,905
That's like...
it's like...

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,275
Well, I don't know what it's
like, but it is definitely bad.

74
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,470
Just be honest
with them.

75
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,870
I'm sure they'll understand
where you're comin' from.

76
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,075
I understand how
hard this is for you.

77
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,945
Maybe if you took
a friend along,

78
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,285
it might
make things easier.

79
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,460
Somepony you trust who
would look out for you.

80
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,315
Thanks so much for
doing this, Trixie.

81
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,900
When Twilight said I
should bring a friend,

82
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,330
you were the first
pony I thought of.

83
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,970
Great idea,
Princess Twilight.

84
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:28,200
Asking me, Starlight's
BEST friend,

85
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:30,340
to help her on this
difficult journey

86
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,865
really shows how wise a
princess you have become.

87
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:35,915
Thanks, Trixie.

88
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,210
I was TALKING about me.

89
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:41,710
The festival lasts
a whole week,

90
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,520
but I'm sure we
won't stay that long.

91
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:45,425
Oh I don't know,
Starlight,

92
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:47,935
time really flies when
you're spending it

93
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:50,595
with your BEST FRIEND!

94
00:05:56,495 --> 00:06:00,730
Bye Starlight!See
you later! Good luck!

95
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,860
There it is! The
town where you --

96
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,745
Magically stole
everypony's cutie mark,

97
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,590
replaced them with equal
signs and forced them all

98
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,220
to hide their
natural talents? Yes.

99
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,080
I was going say
where you came from.

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,110
But yours is a more...
emotionally traumatic answer.

101
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:26,040
I just want to blend in. Be
just another pony in the crowd

102
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,205
enjoying the Sunset
Festival with my friend.

103
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,945
Sounds good to me. And if
things get weird for you,

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,325
just let me know.
I've got your flank.

105
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,860
Is that a promise?

106
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,395
Not just a promise. A GREAT
and POWERFUL promise.

107
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:46,460
Well, I couldn't ask
for more than that.

108
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,500
If we're gonna do
this, let's do it!

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,225
Ahh! STARLIGHT! YOU CAME!

110
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,540
We were worried you
wouldn't be able to make it!

111
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,205
Are you staying
the whole week?

112
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:09,780
We have different
events planned each day!

113
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,030
How is it living
in a castle?

114
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,820
It is SO good
to see you.

115
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,745
Oh yeah. These ponies
are terrifying.

116
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:24,170
It's good to see
all of you too.

117
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:27,170
You got here
JUST in time.

118
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,685
We were having some debate
about these banners.

119
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:33,150
Which do you think
feels more sunsety?

120
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,635
Oh, you don't need
me to decide that.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,845
Whatever you think
is probably best.

122
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:41,690
Uh well, how about
helping us with the routes

123
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:44,630
for the relay races tomorrow.
Can you take a look?

124
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,245
Oh, I shouldn't.
You all go ahead.

125
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:50,020
I just want to
enjoy the festival.

126
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,450
But you WILL be a judge for
the baking competition, right?

127
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:55,950
We had a few questions
about the order of the acts

128
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,340
for the talent show.

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,835
And the unicorns have a
fireworks show planned.

130
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,725
We could REALLY
use your help!

131
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,045
NO!

132
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,580
Huh?

133
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,270
The great and powerful Trixie
would like to thank you all

134
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:22,965
for being such an
amazing audience!

135
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,345
Sadly it is time
for us to depart!

136
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:27,485
Good night, fillies
and gentlefoals!

137
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,960
Ugh. I was horrible
when I led that town.

138
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,825
I was ready for them to not
trust me, but I wasn't ready

139
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,585
for them to put me
in charge again!

140
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,940
With my past, I should never
be in charge of anything.

141
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:57,060
So you messed
up. Big deal.

142
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,915
Don't you ever tell
another pony I said this,

143
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:05,740
but even Trixie's made
mistakes. Ha, I know!

144
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,950
The trick is to just move on and
pretend they never happened!

145
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:13,195
I feel like that's
almost good advice.

146
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,440
Hey! Uh, Pinkie Pie!

147
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,600
Hey, you!

148
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:28,470
So. You're probably wondering
why I'm back so soon.

149
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,600
Where were you?

150
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,570
I went to my old village?
For the festival?

151
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:36,430
Ooo sounds fun!
How was it!

152
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,895
It was kind of a disaster.

153
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,245
I came back early
because I freaked out.

154
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,780
Oooh, sounds awful! Bye!

155
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,490
That was strange.

156
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,765
Isn't she always strange?

157
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,730
Yeah, but not like that.

158
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:56,230
Hey! I'm back early!

159
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,380
Ah, welcome
back.

160
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,480
Have you two noticed Pinkie
acting a little strange?

161
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,880
Pinkie Pie always
acts strange.

162
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,950
Told you.

163
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,425
Anyway, I wanted to
talk to all of you.

164
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,580
Things didn't go the way I
thought they were going to go

165
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:12,180
at the Sunset Festival.

166
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,540
What happened?

167
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,715
I kind of freaked out and
ran out of the village.

168
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,055
HA HA HA!

169
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:21,970
You freaked out and ran
away from a festival?

170
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,025
Ha! That's the funniest dang
thing I've heard all day!

171
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,325
Ha ha, Oh my! Let me guess. The
decorations were TERRIFYING!

172
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:36,305
HA HA HA!

173
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,155
Hello ponies. We need
Rarity and Applejack.

174
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,110
Very important
friendship business.

175
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,650
I have to say I'm really not
as impressed with your friends

176
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,375
as the rest of
Equestria is.

177
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,470
I need to talk
to Twilight.

178
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,000
Twilight! Hello?

179
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:11,230
What do you want?
Twilight's very busy!

180
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:13,585
Spike, I really need
to speak with her.

181
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,895
Make an appointment! She's
a princess after all.

182
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,060
What's wrong with you?
Why are you being so--

183
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:25,020
Rude? I think a certain dragon
didn't get his nap today!

184
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,270
Yeah right. Whatever...

185
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:31,330
Sorry, he's been acting
a little off all day.

186
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,305
I think he missed a
meal or something.

187
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,855
He's not the
only one.

188
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:37,450
Everypony is acting a
little strange today.

189
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:42,285
Yes. It's definitely been one
of those days. How are you?

190
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,955
Not great actually.
You're probably wondering

191
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,890
why I'm back from the
village so early.

192
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:51,125
I didn't want to bring it up but
yeah, it did seem strange.

193
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:52,230
Did it not go well?

194
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,665
The townsponies kept
asking me things,

195
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,935
like they expected me
to be in charge again.

196
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,785
But being a leader is the
last thing I should ever be.

197
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,325
So we left. Very suddenly.
In a literal puff of smoke.

198
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:08,525
Wow. You should DEFINITELY
never go back to that village!

199
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:09,870
What?

200
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,230
If you were worried about what
they thought of you before,

201
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,975
it's probably WAY worse
now. I'd cut my losses.

202
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:20,455
That's surprising
advice coming from you.

203
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,950
Trust me. I'm the
Princess of Friendship.

204
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,585
You don't need those ponies. You
can always make more friends.

205
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,730
Ah, speaking of friends,
if you'll excuse me.

206
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,330
Important business to attend to!

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Cut my losses? That
can't be right.

208
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,450
Hey! I wanted to apologize
for my behavior earlier.

209
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,895
Party Favor? Can you hear me?

210
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:19,525
I TOLD you, you can never
speak to them again!

211
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:22,705
What are you all doing here?

212
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,450
Making sure you do what I said!
I'm your teacher,aren't I?

213
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,950
Didn't I say to
never come back here?

214
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,535
Yes, but that's just
doesn't seem right.

215
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,570
You aren't acting like
yourself. Something is wrong.

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,030
A dream! This is
another dream!

217
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:44,325
<i> Starlight Glimmer...</i>

218
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,555
Princess Luna?

219
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:47,605
<i> Starlight Glimmer!</i>

220
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,525
Princess Luna, where are you?

221
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:52,910
STARLIGHT GLIMMER!THERE IS
NO TIME! YOU MUST GET HELP!

222
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,045
What? What are you talking
about? This is just a dream!

223
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:59,715
NOT HERE! IN THE WAKING WORLD!
THEY'VE TAKEN MY SISTER AND I!

224
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,485
IT'S WORSE THAN THE LAST TIME!

225
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,880
YOUR DREAM CALLED TO ME AND
I WAS ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH!

226
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,170
YOU MUST FIND HELP!

227
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,355
What are you saying?
WHO'S taken you!

228
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,365
BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRUST.

229
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,300
YOU WILL NEED ALL THE
HELP YOU CAN FIND.

230
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,990
THE CHANGELINGS
HAVE RETURNED AND--

231
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:15,275
Princess Luna!

232
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,800
THEY'RE BACK!

233
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,290
Trixie? Trixie, it's
Starlight! Are you awake?

234
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,150
Of COURSE Princess Celestia,
I'd love to perform

235
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,740
for Peanut Butter crackers.

236
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,040
TRIXIE! WAKE UP!

237
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,010
Starlight? What time is it?

238
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:04,925
It's late. I think I figured out
what's wrong with my friends.

239
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,300
I have a whole
list of things

240
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:08,745
that are wrong
with your friends.

241
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,000
We can go over it
in the morning.

242
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,020
No! Trixie, we're in danger!

243
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,330
OK fine. Aside from lack of
sleep, how are we in danger?

244
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:22,595
I think the--

245
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,310
What did you tell me never
to tell another pony?

246
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,245
Starlight, if you woke me
up to play guessing games--

247
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,640
After we left my village!

248
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:36,575
What did you tell me to never
tell another pony you said!?

249
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:40,200
That even Trixie's
made mistakes.

250
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,885
Trixie, there's no time for
this. What did you say?

251
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:48,265
That even Trixie's made
mistakes, OK? Are you happy?

252
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,430
Yes. Sorry. I just had to make
sure you weren't one of them.

253
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,350
One of who?

254
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,930
A changeling.

255
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:58,935
I think they've taken Princess
Celestia and Princess Luna.

256
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,600
What? Are you sure? I
mean, what do we--

257
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,405
We have to tell Twilight!

258
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,775
If I'm right, then it's
too late for that.

259
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,485
Agh!

260
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:29,775
Agh!

261
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:35,890
Is it ready?

262
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,715
Just one more.

263
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,960
QUEEN CHRYSALIS!

264
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:51,925
Ugh, I can't take
any of you seriously

265
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,070
when you look like that.

266
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:54,490
Oh. Right.

267
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:04,280
MUCH better. Now report.

268
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:07,245
Everything here is going
according to plan.

269
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:09,890
We've replaced the six
ponies and their dragon

270
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,175
and have taken
control of the castle.

271
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,800
Excellent. And I've
just received word

272
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,490
that the Princesses from
Canterlot have successfully

273
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,900
been replaced as well.

274
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,530
We thought too small last time,

275
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:28,530
ONE ponynapped
princess wasn't enough.

276
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:32,645
With ALL the most beloved ponies
of Equestria taken care of,

277
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:35,115
NOPONY can stop us.

278
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,325
I can't deal with this.
I'm just a performer.

279
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,685
This is... this is
princess level stuff.

280
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:24,880
But the changeling's have all of
the princesses. We're doomed!

281
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:29,825
Maybe not. Queen Chrysalis only
said they took Luna and Celestia

282
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,565
and obviously Twilight
and the others,

283
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,430
but maybe Cadance is still safe.

284
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,760
Our best bet is to get
to the Crystal Empire

285
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,855
before the changelings
do. That way we--

286
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,235
<i> There's no help coming</i>
<i> from the Crystal Empire.</i>

287
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:47,105
Thorax?

288
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,115
Yes.

289
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:50,265
Your wings look... different.

290
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:53,360
I guess they do.

291
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:58,895
How do I know you aren't
some other changeling

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,755
pretending to be Throax?

293
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,995
You were there when Spike
defended me to the ponies

294
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:05,195
of the Crystal Empire.

295
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:07,235
Princess Twilight said...

296
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:11,405
As the Princess of Friendship,
I should set an example

297
00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:15,600
for all of Equestria, but today,
it was Spike who taught me--

298
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,385
OK! OK. I believe you. We
don't need the whole speech.

299
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:23,840
Trixie, this is Thorax.

300
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,065
He's a reformed changeling.
He's on our side, understand?

301
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:32,295
Hi, it's a pleasure to--

302
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,690
If Starlight says you're on
our side I believe her but...

303
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,225
maybe just stay over
there for now, OK?

304
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:41,925
What did you mean
there's no help.

305
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:43,950
Did the changelings
get Cadance too?

306
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:48,485
They took Cadance, Shining
Armor AND Flurry Heart!

307
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:51,295
Sunburst sent me here to get
Princess Twilight's help

308
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:54,385
but it sounds like it's
too late for that too.

309
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,265
So what should we do?

310
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,760
Yeah, Starlight what
are we going to do?

311
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:03,555
I... I don't know. There
has to be somepony else

312
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:04,565
who can handle this.

313
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,705
There is NOPONY else.

314
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:10,145
Everypony with powerful
magic is already gone!

315
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:12,715
You know, whenever ponies
talk about powerful magic,

316
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,160
they always leave me out.

317
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,670
If I weren't so evolved, I might
decide to take it personally.

318
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:20,215
Well, isn't this
QUITE the combination

319
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,895
of secondary characters.

320
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:24,615
Where are Twilight
and the girls?

321
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,185
First, how do we know
that you're really you?

322
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,485
Shall I continue?

323
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,685
Chrysalis and the
changelings are back.

324
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,045
They've ponynapped all of
the most powerful ponies

325
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:43,060
in Equestria.

326
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:46,090
Celestia, Luna, Cadance,
Shining Armor, Flurry Heart,

327
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,915
Twilight and her
friends. We need to--

328
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,345
They took Fluttershy?

329
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,280
Yes.

330
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,830
Where?

331
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,725
The changeling kingdom. With
you on our side, I think we --

332
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:01,825
Odd. I was trying to take
us right to Fluttershy,

333
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,470
but there is no Fluttershy.

334
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,265
I think I have a pretty good
idea where she might be.

335
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:22,605
Oh. I'd hoped to never see
that place again. Now what?
