           Autumn Blaze, you
           have given us a gift:

418
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,141
            the realization that
            anger is within us.

419
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,477
            But it is our choice
            how we let it out.

420
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,448
  We would very much like it if
  you came back to live with us.

421
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,919
    I can't say how much we've
    missed your beautiful voice.
