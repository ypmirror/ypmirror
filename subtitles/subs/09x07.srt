1
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:09,308
 Silverstream: Ah! See? New posters!
 We never had those underwater!

2
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,745
     I won't keep you in
      suspense any longer.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,714
   We're bringing one of
  Ponyville's oldest traditions

4
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,450
         to our school!
        The Fetlock Fete.

5
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,085
       The what-lock-what?

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,988
It's a pony dance party!
They're the best.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,089
                  I'm ready!

8
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,360
        You don't need to
        do that, Ocellus.

9
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,262
         This year, the
        event's at school

10
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,031
   and open to everycreature.

11
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,933
     We're calling our
     dance the "Amity Ball".

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,201
Even better!

13
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:41,040
        Yona not know
       "Amity Ball" dance.

14
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:43,775
   Yona only know traditional
     dance of Yakyakistan.

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,776
          Go like this.

16
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,314
      Ball dance like that?

17
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:55,020
           Not exactly. It isn't
           just one dance;

18
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:58,624
   it's a whole night of 'em!
   Plus an awesome party!

19
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,460
   And we'll have all the old
   Fetlock Fete traditions!

20
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,929
      The Pony-Pal contest,
     the Lucky Pot Dinner...

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,051
         You'll love it!

22
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,834
  So like this says, "Get your
    Pony-Pal and come along!"

23
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,436
           Wanna go? I got
           nothing better to do.

24
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,139
You had me at "Dinner."

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,477
     Now, who wants to help
      me hang more posters?

26
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,411
          ME!

27
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:20,245
    Sure!

28
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,553
Hey Yona, want to
be my Pony-Pal?

29
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,522
We can enter the
contest together...

30
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,024
                  But Yona yak.
                  Yona not pony.

31
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,026
   So?

32
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,062
          Pony. Pony. More Pony.

33
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,997
Aw, that's just a poster.

34
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,001
C'mon, it'll be tons of
fun together! Promise.

35
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,937
       OK. Yona go with Sandbar.

36
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,573
       Great! I'll get the
     tickets. See you later!

37
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,042
          Ha ha ha ha !

38
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:54,414
   Yona not let Sandbar down!
   Yak best at being Pony-pal!

39
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,685
     But Yona not sure
      how if she not pony...

40
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,755
       Oh! Terribly sorry, Yona.

41
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,591
      All these dresses I'm
      sewing for the dance

42
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,693
  have me completely frazzled!

43
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,530
        Dress? Yona need
        dress for dance!?

44
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,233
   Yona have lots to learn
   about being best Pony-Pal!

45
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,208
    [sewing machine humming]

46
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,142
         [knock at door]
          Ah!

47
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,944
Yona interrupting?

48
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,447
Oh! Ha ha! Well, not
interrupting exactly.

49
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,949
 More like blocking the flow...

50
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,417
stopping me from what I'm doing..

51
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,486
So, yes, interrupting.

52
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,353
      Ha ha.

53
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,656
        Now... what can I
        do for you, Yona?

54
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,359
Yona not know yak need
special pony dress for dance.

55
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,662
Yona no can wear what
Yona always wear?

56
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,798
                Yona could. I
                mean, you could.

57
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
But the Fetlock Fete,

58
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,368
  or whatever
Twilight is calling it,

59
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,070
     it's all about a tradition.

60
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,140
   There's a certain way to do
    everything at the dance.

61
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,609
Yes! That what
Yona want to learn!

62
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:35,547
How to do all the Pony things.
Even if Yona has to wear dress.

63
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,084
Well, er.. if that's
what you really want.

64
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:43,021
       Mm hm! Yona be best
      Pony-pal for Sandbar!

65
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:48,293
In that case, at an elegant
affair like a Pony dance,

66
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,730
one must converse in a
sophisticated fashion.

67
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,132
Talking with Brussels
sprouts in your mouth

68
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,502
helps you learn to <i>articulate</i>.

69
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,273
Take a mouthful and
repeat after me.

70
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,243
"How kind of you
to ask me to tea!"

71
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,516
        "May I offer you
       a glass of punch?"

72
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,624
      "The weather is quite
        agreeable today."

73
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,768
   Yona like Brussels sprouts!

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,969
Let's move on.

75
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,573
  We will need to do something
   about your hair style,

76
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,943
        but first, let's
      find the right dress.

77
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,714
      Now...purple taffeta,
        frosted chiffon,

78
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,485
      [gasp] gold brocade,
      one of my favorites.

79
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,620
                Yona like brown.

80
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:52,791
   Blech. Earth tones. They're so... heh..
    earthy, aren't they?

81
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,426
      Don't worry; we
      shall find something

82
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,861
     to make you stand out.

83
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,131
     Yona not want to stand
    out. Yona want to fit in.

84
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,534
       Ah. Quite. And by the
       time we're through,

85
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,503
     it'll be like you've
    been going to pony dances

86
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:05,704

128
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,520
Oh, Yona already
have Pony-Pal.

129
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,222
              Oh not that, darling.
              The DANCING!

130
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,858
      And I know precisely
       who can help.

131
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,799
Uh, Rainbow Dash and
Fluttershy good at dancing?

132
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,736
     Don't be so surprised! I'm
     awesome at EVERYTHING!

133
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,805
       Except for baking.

134
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,606
There are two traditional dances

135
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,809
that everypony does at the Fete.

136
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,677
       After a few days of
       practicing with us,

137
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,145
     you'll know them both.

138
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,513
        And fit right in!

139
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,283
Absolutely. We'll start
with the slow dance,

140
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,486
the Pony Cotillion. That's
Fluttershy's specialty.

141
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,790
    Oh, heh, I wouldn't say
    specialty; it's just fun!

142
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,560
 Here, Yona. I made you a chart.

143
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,298
     All you have to do is
    follow these dance steps.

144
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,099
                You'll learn
                them in no time.

145
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,739
    Now. Just start walking.

146
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,746
     Step on whatever color
      I name. Let's begin.

147
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:04,583
    Blue. Red. Step ahead
    Green, black, now step back.

148
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05,951
                 Now you try!

149
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:10,455
Blue. Red. Step...Oop.
No. Yona start over.

150
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,556
           Blue, red,

151
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,925
         Green, black...
         Yak step back?

152
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,794
                    Good! Now...

153
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,595
      Black, green, red and blue

154
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,364
 Red, black, hold one and two...

155
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,266
                  Red. Blue. Red
                  once more.

156
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,268
             Green black blue
             red three and four!

157
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,469
              Agh!

158
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,305
       Yona feel like she
      have four front feet!

159
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,381
           Oh.. Um, maybe we should
           try this again later.

160
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,784
       Don't worry, Yona!
     That was the hard one!

161
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,619
       Mine's WAY easier.

162
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,927
      A little dance called
       the "Pony-Prance."

163
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,362
  The key to this one is SPEED!

164
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,069
     Come on, Yona! Try it!

165
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,073
     Just get with the flow
      and let yourself GO!

166
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,015
    Oh, my!

167
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,284
          Whoa, there!

168
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,089
    Yona LIKE to flow and go!

169
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,601
Welcome to Sweet
Apple Acres, Yona!

170
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,102
Rarity tells us
ya need some help

171
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,571
getting ready for
the big dance.

172
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:36,441
SOME! Ha! Indeed. And we only
have a few more days.

173
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,510
Well, you've come
to the right place!

174
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,879
  Because if you ask me what my
 favorite part of the dance is,

175
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:45,150
  I'd say everything about the
  dance, but especially...this!

176
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,519
The Fetlock Lucky
Pot Dinner!

177
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,921
     It's part of the
   Ponyville dance tradition.

178
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,890
        Everypony brings
        a dish to share,

179
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,259
     and we swap 'em without
     knowin' whose is whose.

180
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,262
         Although my Lucky Pot
         probably gives me away. Heh.

181
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,664
You can cook
anything you want!

182
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,469
   But can I suggest... oh, I
   don't know maybe.. CUPCAKES!?

183
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,938
 Er. I already told Yona a little
  bit about that tradition.

184
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,507
     She's even brought her
      own Lucky... bucket.

185
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,810
  Yak buckets are best buckets.

186
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:15,080
           Yona think make
           traditional Yak dish.

187
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,581
              Tree Root Stew.

188
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,853
               Extra fiber! Mmm!
               Ponies like?

189
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,521
          Hm. I'm not sure!

190
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:26,224
        So, just in case,
        let's get baking!

191
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,862
Flour, milk, sugar,
butter icing.

192
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,864
Then we mix and we beat
and we pour into pans

193
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:33,632
and we bake!

194
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,134
And now YOU try it!

195
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,705
                      Achoooo!

196
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,208
Well, that's one way to mix it.

197
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,210
       Let's try something
        a little simpler.

198
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,612
       I'm sure we can do
      something with these.

199
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,017
      OK! Applesauce it is.

200
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,656
   Blue...red...green...blue....!

201
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,383
     [muffled] How kind of you
     to ask me to tea!

202
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:39,497
[slowly] How kind of you
to ask me to tea!

203
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,872
     Blue. Red. Step ahead.

204
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:51,977
     How kind of you. Green,
     black, Yona step back.

205
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,379
     ...to ask Yona to tea.

206
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,247
   Black, green, red and blue

207
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,182
  Red, black, hold one and two.

208
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,251
    Red. Blue. Red once more.

209
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,120
        Green black blue
       red three and four!

210
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,023
            Look! She's dancing!

211
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,659
                 How 'bout that?
                 And she's good!

212
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,529
Yona! If someone at the party
tells you they're thirsty,

213
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,764
you say...?

214
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:19,037
       May Yona, um, may <i>I</i>
       offer you a cup of punch?

215
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,606
By Celestia, I
think she's got it!

216
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,441
She's really got it!

217
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,076
               Yona, you did it!

218
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,911
                You dance great!

219
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,514
     And are so well-spoken!

220
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,717
 You'll be the hit of the Ball!

221

    Hello, everycreature! I'm
     your DJ Scales N' Tail,

227
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,011
     spinning your favorite
      tunes all night long.

228
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:04,048
   So welcome to the Fetlock
   Fe--I mean, the Amity Ball!

229
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,829
        I'm just glad I'm
       here with you guys.

230
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,331
At least I'm not the only
 non-pony in the crowd.

231
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,567
        You're not still worried
        about that, are you?

232
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,536
  Like Headmare Twilight said,

233
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,005
      This is a dance
       for everycreature.

234
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,873
        There's no
        "pony pressure."

235
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,678
You should have
told Yona that.

236
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,946
               What do you mean?

237
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,098
        Didn't you hear?

238
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,149
 Our teachers have been helping
  her get ready for the dance.

239
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,285
   She's been taking lessons.

240
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,390
She's gone full
pony for the dance.

241
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,591
All for you...

242
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,794
          For me? Why?

243
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:55,133
       How kind of you to ask me
       to this soiree, Sandbar.

244
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,272
Woah..! 
       Er..                             
                    What?

245
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,175
You look
so... weird!

246
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,244
Yona..?

247
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:10,348
   Quite. Oh, I do hope I make
    a good pony-pal for you.

248
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,284
        Uh.. Of course you do!

249
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,222
But Yona, you didn't need
to do any of...this.

250
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,791
    And why are you
   talking so funny?

251
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,863
    I am not talking
     funny. I'm fitting in.

252
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,798
Could've fooled me.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,536
    Yona! You look absolutely
    scrumptious, darling!

254
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,639
  Why don't I get that for you?

255
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,210
                      You made a
                      Lucky Pot?

256
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,213
 Precisely like ponies prepare!

257
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,582
     Welcome, everycreature
         to our school's

258
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,919
    first annual Amity Ball!

259
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,555
  For those of you who've never
  attended a Fetlock Fete,

260
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,157
    we can't wait to show you
   some of our fun traditions

261
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,559
     on this special night.

262
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,964
            So Spike...

263
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,765
         Er. Scales N' Tail?

264
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,871
   Uh, right. Scales N' Tail.
  Let's get this party started!

265
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:11,376
  Oh, yeah, party ponies! It's
  time to raise the roof

266
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,345
   and stomp your hoof for the
   traditional first dance

267
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,648
       of the night...the
         Pony Cotillion.

268
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,193
     Ah! Yona know this one.

269
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,361
             You do?

270
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:34,365
    Indeed! Green, black,
    then step back. Shall we?

271
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,704
         Hee hee!
[chuckle]

272
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,044
  Wow! How did you learn this?

273
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,080
      I had good teachers.

274
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,383
              Whoa!

275
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,489
    Yona! Are you all right?

276
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,458
       Yona never practice
      dance with dress on.

277
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,364
 Uh. I mean... heh, heh, may I offer
  you a cup of punch?

278
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:10,101
      Spike: Time to shake
       things up a little!

279
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,904
  That's right, everycreature,
  it's the Pony Prance!

280
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,609
               Uh.. maybe we should
               sit this one out.

281
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:21,746
        No! I do so LOVE
        the Pony Prance!

282
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:22,647
              Whoa!

283
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,006
              Whoa!

284
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,207
         It's OK, Yona!

285
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,942
       Just stop bouncing!

286
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,110
           We got you!

287
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,749
     Wig...come...OFF!

288
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,083
              Huh?

289
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,193
               Ah!

290
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,529
  What a calamitous Yakciddent!

291
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,399
              Yona!

292
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,366
     What happened?

293
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,701
       Are you all right?

294
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:22,673
     No! Yona not all right!
     Yona want to be alone!

295
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,658
             Yona sad. Yona sing
             sad song. Sad Yona.

296
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:46,732
Yona no blame bird. Yona no
 want to be around Yona either.

297
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:53,171
  Yona sad, Yona sing sad song.

298
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,405
         Yona?

299
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,281
  How Sandbar find Yona?

300
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,717
  I know you pretty well by now.
  I figured you'd come here.

301
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,553
                   Besides, it's
                   where I'd go

302
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,088
            if something like
            that happened to me.

303
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,524
     Sandbar mean something
     awful and embarrassing!

304
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:17,228
   So awful, Yona cannot come
    down from treehouse ever!

305
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,132
      Will Sandbar bring
      Yona food and water?

306
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,935
             You know, it really
             wasn't that bad.

307
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,437
       I don't think anycreature
       hardly even noticed.

308
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,341
             Well, maybe one
             or two didn't.

309
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,477
       If they happened to be in
       Canterlot for the day.

310
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,379
                But anyway, it's
                all over now.

311
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,581
          So, will you come back
          to the dance with me?

312
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,354
Yona disappoint Sandbar. Yona
not make very good pony.

313
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,356
            Why would you think
            you disappointed me?

314
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,293
     And who said anything about
     having to be a good pony?

315
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,596
Yona just want to do all
the right pony things

316
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,131
and fit in at dance.

317
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,402
Then maybe Sandbar and Yona
win Best Pony-pals Contest.

318
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,671
        Instead, Yona win
        Worst Pony Ever.

319
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,374
        That's not true.

320
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,611
Really? Sandbar name two
ponies worse than Yona.

321
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,379
           Cozy Glow and Sombra.

322
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,650
Hm. OK. Sandbar right.
They worse.

323
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,685
   Yona, it doesn't really
  matter if you're a great pony

324
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:18,356
   or a horrible pony. You're
   the best YONA I know.

325
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,259
       That's why I asked
        you to the dance.

326
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,193
             Really?

327
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,961
              I never wanted you
              to be anything

328
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,363
                other than
                what you are.

329
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,400
                My friend,
                Yona. The Yak.

330
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,067
                Agh!

331
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,972
      So, what do you say? Let's
      go back to the dance?

332
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,486
                   Don't worry.
                   I'm with you.

333
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,356
We ALL are.

334
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,392
        Pinkie: Yona, are
         you all right?

335
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,261
   We were so worried when
   you disappeared like that!

336
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,298
   Yona fine. But Yona sorry.

337
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,802
  Not mean to make such a mess
  and ruin the pony dance.

338
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,370
It's not your fault, Sugarcube.

339
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,938
       It's the opposite!

340
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,875
      If anything, WE
     should be apologizing.

341
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,143
        I thought we were
        just teaching you

342
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,645
  how to have fun at the dance.

343
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,182
We never meant to try to turn
you into something you're not.

344
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:18,983
             Is OK.

345
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,085
  Friend help Yona feel better.

346
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,187
      Twilight: And that's why we're
        giving you this.

347
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,326
     No way! The Pony-Pal Prize!

348
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,562
From now on, it's the
Annual Amity Ball Award

349
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,797
for Friendship.

350
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,765
No pony-ness required.

351
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,269
   We all decided that you and
   Yona totally earned this.

352
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,005
Your actions tonight

353
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,774
exemplified the true
meaning of friendship.

354
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,911
    Congratulations, you two.

355
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,786
   Yona! I'm glad you're back.

356
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,456
    Everypony wants to learn
    that crazy dance you did!

357
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,527
 Yak-Dance? Is easy. Yona teach.

358
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,096
        If everycreature
        want to learn?

359
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,964
      It would be an honor.

360
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,369
      You asked for it and
      DJ Scales N' Tail

361
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,037
        is gonna deliver!

362
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:17,575
 Everycreature join Yona for...
 the Yakyakistan Stomp!
