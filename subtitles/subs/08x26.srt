1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,772
      Magic is disappearing
      all across Equestria.

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,841
   Didn't we learn about a
    creature that<i> eats</i> magic?

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,643
  Somepony should investigate.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,444
            We'll go.

5
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:13,979
        I thought
        Starlight Glimmer

6
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,981
      was going to be
      temporary Head Mare.

7
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:19,251
  With Equestria under attack,
   Ponies must stand together!

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,221
I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
 My friends are in trouble!

9
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:26,125
  It seems my little protégé's
  plan worked after all.

10
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:29,795
       The future empress
       of friendship!

11
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,998
             Hahaha!

12
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,073
       Cozy Glow is
       behind all of this!?

13
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:15,975
Ha ha ha ha!

14
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:19,479
        I'm not usually a
        fan of ponies,

15
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:23,382
     but draining your
     precious world of magic

16
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:27,720
       so she could trap the six
       of you was inspiring!

17
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:30,022
Ha ha ha ha!

18
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,659
          Um... there's
          seven of us.

19
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,161
 I knew we shouldn't have left!

20
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:37,396
           But Starlight's in
           charge at the school.

21
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,099
            If anypony can stop
            Cozy Glow, it's her.

22
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:43,202
    Tirek: Cozy Glow
   outsmarted the six of you.

23
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:47,239
    I doubt this "Starlight"
     stands a chance. [cough]

24
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,908
   We have to get out of here.

25
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,277
     Our students can't
    handle Cozy on their own.

26
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,446
     Then I guess we'll just
    have to bust our way out!

27
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:03,021
    [groan] That didn't work. [groan]

28
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,791
    Not everything can be
    solved with brute force.

29
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,895
    We need magic to escape.

30
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,530
Maybe there's a way to
get out without magic.

31
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,766
Like a secret lever,
or a secret button,

32
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,502
 or a secret admirer who knows a
 secret about you, but is all,

33
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,637
  "Your secret's safe with me
  because I put it in Tartarus

34
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:19,972
       and I have a key."

35
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,207
         I'm afraid not.

36
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,876
 The most powerful villains and
 monsters of all time

37
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,044
        are trapped here.

38
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,680
       And without our
        magic, so are we.

39
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,518
            Unless...

40
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,289
   ...These creatures might be
  losing their magical powers,

41
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,159
  but there's still a magic
  that makes up what they are.

42
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,894
       Maybe we can borrow
        some of that!

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,267
         Uh, excuse me?

44
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,970
      Um, Chancellor Neighsay?

45
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,872
   You might as well get used
     to calling me

46
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,440
     Headstallion Neighsay.

47
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,709
       I plan to be here
      for quite some time.

48
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,980
Gee, it sure is a relief
to have somepony in charge,

49
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,282
what with the magical
crisis going on,

50
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:07,653
and we're all so grateful to
you for taking care of those..

51
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:11,191
non-ponies, but doesn't
the EEA need you?

52
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:15,060
 What the EEA needs is somepony
  to protect this school

53
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,129
       from the threats at
       Equestria's borders

54
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,166
   instead of gallivanting off
   on adventures beyond them.

55
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,902
Twilight didn't just
run off willy-nilly.

56
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,837
She left ME in charge.

57
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,439
I'm her right-hoof-mare!

58
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,408
        Another in a long
        list of mistakes

59
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,811
     the "Princess of
      Friendship" has made.

60
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:34,814
 Rest assured, from now on this
   school shall be run

61
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,282
       according to strict
        EEA guidelines...

62
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,653
               the way it always
               should have been.

63
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,856
Well, that sounds just peachy...

64
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,024
     ...Headstallion Neighsay!

65
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,300
  Sweetie Belle: Cozy Glow did
  all of this? How? Why?

66
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,668
        I don't know, but
        come on, y'all.

67
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,438
  We gotta get Starlight out of
  there before she comes back!

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,806
         Sandbar: Wait!

69
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,545
         Sweetie Belle!

70
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:07,513
              HELP!

71
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,421
 That's gotta be what's sucking
 up all the magic in Equestria!

72
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,923
    But if that's true, then
     Twilight and the others

73
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,525
  went to Tartarus for nothing.

74
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,995
 And if all of Equestria's magic
 is getting sucked up in there,

75
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,864
       there's no way for
      them to get back!

76
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,834
    We need to get help!

77
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,735
But Starlight's trapped here,

78
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:32,338
 and there's no way to get word
  to Celestia or anypony else!

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,506
    I guess we're on our own...

80
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,716
Still locked, huh?

81
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,851
      We've gotta at least
      try to get out.

82
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,420
     Why? If Sandbar's
     turned his back on us,

83
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,789
        every other pony
        probably has too.

84
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,824
      Sandbar not turn his back!

85
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,660
          Sandbar is our friend.

86
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,096
 Uh, Did you miss the part where
   he said he didn't want

87
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,798
     anything to do with us?

88
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,501
 Maybe he just said that so one
 of us could be free to snoop

89
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,004
      around and figure
      out what's going on!

90
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,739
             [window opens]
            Sandbar: I don't know...

91
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:10,276
   That sounds too clever for
     a pony to come up with.

92
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,811
          Ya ha ha ha!

93
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,748
      Yona knew Sandbar
      was still our friend!

94
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,416
  We all are.

95
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,951
      Except for Cozy Glow.

96
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,353
      That pony is NOT who
       we thought she was.

97
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,022
         She's the one draining
         magic out of Equestria!

98
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,391
              WHAT?

99
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,459
      We'll explain on the
       way, but right now,

100
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,461
      we've gotta get to
      Chancellor Neighsay.

101
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:30,640
                   Huh?

102
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,132
        I know he doesn't
        like non-ponies,

103
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,300
    but if we tell him what's
     going on, he'll help.

104
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:41,540
  I'm sure you're all concerned
   about the magic situation,

105
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:45,611
  but I want to assure you that
  this institution is safe,

106
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,780
       despite the absence
       of your Headmare.

107
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:51,417
  As your new Headstallion, let
  me be the first to say

108
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,020
   that the reign of Princess
     Twilight is OVER!

109
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,857
  From now on, this school will
   adhere to EEA doctrine

110
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,593
        as it should have
        from the start!

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,934
 Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay,
   for that rousing speech.

112
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,307
  I know you're a stallion who
  truly believes what you say.

113
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,775
      And when you say this
      school will be run

114
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:18,545
according to EEA doctrine,
I know you mean it.

115
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,347
  And.. when you say there won't
     be any more lessons

116
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,617
 from the Princess of Friendship
  at the School of Friendship,

117
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,085
   I guess you mean that too.

118
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,255
       That's not exact--

119
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,024
      But! Twilight decided
       to run her school

120
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,160
 outside of the EEA guidelines.

121
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,296
       And even though you
       tried to stop her,

122
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,931
     Princesses Celestia and
     Luna trusted her enough

123
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,034
         to support her.

124
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,669
     Well, I wouldn't say--

125
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:46,572
       So since I know you
       mean what you say,

126
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,375
      my question is really
      for the students.

127
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,644
  Are we going to give the pony
  who already tried to wreck

128
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,215
    Twilight's school once
    <i>another</i> chance to do it?

129
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:03,155
I guess things will have to stay
 the way Twilight wants them,

130
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,225
       which includes
      leaving me in charge.

131
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,092
              All: Yeah!

132
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:09,942
Neighsay: I can-

133
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,036
OK, so maybe we need a new plan...

134
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,210
     Oh, oh, not too tight.

135
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,978
We don't want to
hurt the Chancellor.

136
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,282
I'm sure Twilight will
know what to do with him

137
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,317
when she gets back.

138
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,085
  Now, back to class everyone.

139
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,288
 We've let the EEA disrupt our
 friendship studies long enough.

140
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,362
         Why are you doing this?

141
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,130
            I thought you wanted
            to have somepony

142
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,498
        in charge of the school.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,668
Oh, I do! You just aren't
the pony I had in mind.

144
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,941
   I can't very well have the
   EEA running the school

145
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,842
   if I want to run it myself.

146
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,445
      Of course, that's
       just the beginning.

147
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,348
    You see, if there's one
    thing I've learned here,

148
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,586
  it's that friendship is the
  most powerful thing there is,

149
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,722
     and as Headmare of the
      School of Friendship,

150
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,359
      nopony will have more
      friends than me!

151
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:19,531
    Making me the most
   powerful pony in Equestria!

152
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,073
                Hey, Cozy Glow.
                What's so funny?

153
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,176
          Are you just happy to
          be running the school?

154
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,279
Oh, I'm just keeping
Twilight's seat warm.

155
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,415
 Still, it's pretty impressive!

156
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,050
Is there anything
we can do to help?

157
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,454
We can hang out with
you all day if you want.

158
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,324
    You know, there is
   something I need help with.

159
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,759
     Yay! Whoo-hoo! Awesome!

160
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,505
         Oh. Wonderful.

161
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,974
            I suppose you've
           all come to gloat.

162
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,546
Actually, we've come to undo
all these chains and free you!

163
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,348
            But.. why?

164
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,851
Now that nasty pony
met even nastier pony,

165
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,120
        maybe nasty pony
        not be so nasty.

166
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,094
         Also, we'd kinda
        like to stop Cozy

167
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,497
    before she drains all the
    magic from Equestria.

168
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,300
   She's behind that as well?

169
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,969
       I must get word to
       Celestia and Luna.

170
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,206
    How? Without magic, it'll
    take forever to get to them.

171
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,876
  While it's true that unicorns
  have lost their ability

172
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,046
    to cast spells, the most
    potent magic in Equestria

173
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,115
 is housed in our... artifacts!

174
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:49,621
 The EEA medallion allows me to
  travel throughout Equestria.

175
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,790
      Its magic worked when
      I chained you up,

176
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,959
  perhaps it still has enough
  to send me to the Princesses.

177
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,805
I hope he makes it.

178
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,407
      I hope he doesn't come
      back and lock us up again.

179
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,942
<i>If</i> he comes back.

180
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,411
Everything's
gonna be fine!

181
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,481
Twilight and the others are
 probably already on their way.

182
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,524
      Are you sure there's
       magic in Cerberus?

183
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,259
 Clarissa the pig has two tails,

184
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,160
      and while her singing
      voice is lovely,

185
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,363
          I don't think
          it's magical.

186
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,998
  We need to try everything if
   we want to get out of here.

187
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,768
          I don't know;
          Tartarus isn't so bad.

188
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,904
               I could hang out
               here for a while.

189
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,776
                Eh. Maybe not
                forever, though.

190
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,879
Tirek: But that is just
what it will be!

191
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:53,251
If my protege has followed my
instructions, by sunset tonight,

192
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,354
every last vestige
of Equestrian magic

193
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,991
will disappear into
the ether.. FOREVER!

194
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,128
  Have you even thought about
  what losing magic would mean?

195
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,432
It means the six of you will be
trapped here, like me!

196
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,867
          Spike: Seven!

197
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,001
                   Exactly.

198
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,402
  It means you're trapped here.

199
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,204
        Forever. With US.

200
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:18,175
        Ahh.. I hadn't thought
        of it like that...

201
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,613
   So what do we do, Twilight?

202
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,516
    Dash and Applejack nearly
    have Cerberus tired out.

203
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,552
  If Rarity pitches in, I think
  they can get him to sit still

204
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,022
     long enough to try
      what I have in mind.

205
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,458
I'm sure I can get the
other monsters to help.

206
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,495
Besides, I would NEVER
call them monsters.

207
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,296
        What about Tirek?

208
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,598
      He's probably got
     some magic too, right?

209
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,168
        Leave him to me.

210
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,304
           Dooowwwn...

211
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,373
          OK, everyone!

212
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,376
  Time to show Equestria
   that you aren't "monsters"

213
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,079
        You're wonderful,
       mystical creatures!

214
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,081
      <i> ♪ I know it's not</i>
      <i> your birthday so, ♪</i>

215
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,616
       <i> ♪ you get a party</i>
         <i> even though, ♪</i>

216
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,185
     <i> ♪ we'll sing and dance</i>
       <i> from one to ten, ♪</i>

217
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,121
      <i> ♪ and then we'll do</i>
        <i> it all again! ♪</i>

218
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:06,024
More tea, Princess Pudding Rock?

219
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:10,862
    "Oh, don't mind if I do!"
     Heh heh.

220
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,333
   I can do this <i>all eternity.</i>

221
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,935
FINE! I'll help you leave.

222
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,403
Just please stop!

223
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,771
                   Tirek's in!

224
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,908
  It's just so excitin' to have
 a foal our age runnin' things.

225
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,311
 We should have an ice
cream social every day!

226
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,147
        That's a splendid
        idea, Apple Bloom.

227
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,615
   But to tell you the truth,

228
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,118
    the thing I need help
     with most is cleaning.

229
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,120
     Say no more. Just take
     us around the school

230
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,723
     and show us everything
     you want cleaned.

231
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,025
         Well, actually, you can
         start right in here.

232
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,796
 It looks pretty clean already.

233
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,433
       Do you three think
        you can fool me!?

234
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,601
       I know a diversion
         when I see it.

235
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,141
Uh. Why pony lead us back down here?

236
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,977
      We obviously can't
     handle Cozy on our own,

237
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,879
    but we can't just sit
    around and wait for help.

238
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,482
  So, there's one more prisoner
   I think we should free.

239
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,151
     Ooh! I guess Starlight.
     Is it Starlight?

240
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,390
    Counselor pony come out!

241
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,358
  We need help with nasty pony!

242
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,164
She can't talk to
us from in there.

243
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,833
We'll have to figure
a way to get her out.

244
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,806
     Hey! This is just like
     chapter twelve in

245
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,475
  Kanthaka's Facts & Artifacts,
   from Twilight's class.

246
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,913
                  What? I've
                  been studying.

247
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,147
               Finals are coming
               up, you know.

248
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,249
 Actually, I remember that too!

249
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,784
      Cozy must have linked
      these artifacts

250
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,452
 to act like a mystical magnet,

251
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,723
   attracting all the magic
   in Equestria into that orb!

252
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,290
So, we can shut it down

253
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,226
by yanking one of these
things out, right?

254
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,595
    Sure, though, that would
    probably cause a magical

255
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,364
     feedback loop and
    destroy the whole school!

256
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,666
        Cozy: Destroy the
      School of Friendship?

257
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:56,968
           Oh, dear...

258
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,738
  Chancellor Neighsay was
  wrong about a lot of things,

259
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,340
     but I guess he was
     right about all of you.

260
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,045
           All right.

261
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,479
       Is everypony ready?

262
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,849
              Siiiit!

263
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:12,651
              Good!

264
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,352
I can't say for how much longer..

265
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,958
          All eternity!

266
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,259
       YES, by all means!

267
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,793
  Please, just get on with it!

268
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,596
              Ahem.

269
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:28,499
      There's your cue, you
       evil centaur, you.

270
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,381
           That's it!

271
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,882
      I think its working!

272
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,355
            Come on!

273
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,190
        I don't know how
       long I can hold it!

274
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,926
                  Good boy!

275
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,795
          Bye friends!

276
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,664
 Hopefully we'll be able to turn
  you all back into your normal

277
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,499
     wonderful selves soon.

278
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,534
       Thanks for the
      assist, Your Redness!

279
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,178
      Yay! Twilight did it!

280
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,646
     I couldn't have done it
     without all your help.

281
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,148
I'm not sure we did!

282
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,185
               NO!

283
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,055
  Tirek said all of Equestria's
 magic would be gone at sunset.

284
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,890
     Without magic, there's
      no way we'll get back

285
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,258
     to the school in time.

286
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,893
      What does that mean?

287
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,361
       It means... we failed.

288
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,402
     After everything
    Twilight's done for you,

289
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,438
    why would you want
     to destroy her school?

290
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,973
            WE don't!

291
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,541
      You're the one using
      these artifacts

292
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,443
 to drain magic from Equestria.

293
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,444
               Me?

294
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,214
   We all just saw you with
    your claws all over them!

295
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,883
       [gasp] It all makes sense.

296
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,719
   These creatures want magic
      gone from Equestria

297
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,922
  because it's the only thing
  ponies have that they don't!

298
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,358
      Technically, there's
       a magical component

299
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,093
        when Silversteam
        and I transform.

300
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,962
      And Yona's friends'
      friendship IS magic.

301
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,197
         Twilight said!

302
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,333
     And you repaid her by
     sending her to Tartarus

303
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,334
      on a wild goose chase
      so you could destroy

304
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,037
     everything she's built!

305
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,406
    Ah! They've even trapped
    Starlight in that.. that thing!

306
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,108
  We have to defend the school!

307
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,579
  No! No! Don't listen to her!

308
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,450
             Aaaah!

309
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,051
             Gallus!

310
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,537
They just sacrificed themselves
 trying to save their friend...

311
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,472
      Professor Dash always
      says there's nothing

312
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,041
      more loyal than that.

313
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,010
 Shouldn't <i>we</i> try to save them?

314
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,678
They brought this on themselves.

315
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,179
   There's nothing we can do.

316
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,249
          That doesn't seem very
          generous or kind.

317
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,684
           Yeah, yeah...

318
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,520
     The Elements of Harmony
       are very important.

319
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,056
   They're just not applicable
   in every circumstance.

320
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,058
       And with magic gone
         from Equestria,

321
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,593
       I'm not even sure
       the Tree of Harmony

322
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,462
       will be as helpful
       as it once was.

323
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,169
        What's happening!?

324
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,110
       They're glowing
       like the Elements!

325
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,413
       I think the Tree of
       Harmony saved them!

326
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,083
   Guess our friendship is
    pretty magical after all.

327
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,385
   Hurry, grab the artifacts!

328
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,892
    Um... didn't you say that
    could DESTROY the school?

329
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,661
   But if we don't try, we
    could lose magic forever.

330
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,265
    You all better get clear.

331
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,968
   Wait! Where are you going!?

332
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,370
         Counselor Pony!

333
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,906
Uh.. It's nice to see you too.

334
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,740
     I guess magic is back.

335
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,276
       Cozy: You've
       ruined everything!

336
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,245
      Now Twilight and her
       ridiculous friends

337
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,880
    can escape from Tartarus!

338
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,019
         I mean... Yay!

339
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,388
    All my friends are safe!

340
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,324
You can drop the ACT, Cozy Glow.

341
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:50,428
  Your pen pal, Tirek, told us
   all about how he helped YOU

342
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,363
     suck up all that magic.

343
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,532
But I still don't
understand why.

344
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,003
            WHY!? Because
            friendship is power!

345
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,871
     You might be the
     Princess of Friendship,

346
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,040
         but as Headmare
         of this school,

347
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,910
     I can collect even
     more friends than you!

348
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,014
      You're the one who
      doesn't get it, Cozy.

349
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,949
     Friendship IS powerful,

350
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,485
       but power isn't why
      you make friends.

351
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,721
      I'm sorry I couldn't
       teach you that.

352
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,023
      Gallus: Well, you taught US!

353
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,794
   You can't let one bad apple
   make you think you failed.

354
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,562
       And we never could
        have stopped her

355
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,831
  if we hadn't learned what you
   taught us about friendship.

356
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:27,965
            Cozy: Honesty?

357
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:28,899
            Loyalty?

358
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,767
           Generosity?

359
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,002
         Blah blah blah...

360
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,471
   I can make more friends
   without using any of them.

361
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:37,275
   And if I can't do it here,
   I'll do it somewhere else!

362
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,743
Yeah. I don't think so.

363
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,323
[sigh] I'm glad you are
back in charge

364
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,325
      of the School of
      Friendship, Princess.

365
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,830
 It's clear to me now that there
 is no pony better suited

366
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,931
          for the job.

367
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,338
What's going on!?

368
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,040
     Hi, Headmare Twilight.

369
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,510
      We're just practicing
       for graduation.

370
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,779
Graduation..?

371
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,514
        Now that we've
        saved Equestria,

372
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,149
       we figured we were
        done with school.

373
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,221
  Saving Equestria is nice, but
   I'm afraid it'll take

374
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,790
 more than one semester to learn

375
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,692
      all there is to know
      about friendship.

376
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,259
            [belch] Told ya!

377
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,195
            AWWWWWW!

378
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,231
Your Headmare is right.

379
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,066
  I thought friendship was
   something that only ponies

380
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,668
  should share with each other,

381
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,338
       but you all taught
       me how wrong I was.

382
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,675
 I suppose true friendship can
 take a lifetime to understand.

383
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,512
   If it were easy to learn,
   we wouldn't need a school.

384
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,114
             [crash] Woah!

385
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,250
       We held her off as
        long as we could!

386
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,185
        But she locked us
         in this closet!

387
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,920
What happened! Is
everything all right!?

388
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,054
       Where's Cozy Glow?

389
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,360
        Everything worked
         out just fine.

390
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,962
        As for Cozy Glow,
        I can assure you.

391
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:08,466
  Where she's going, she won't
  be causing any more trouble.

392
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,109
         Of course it's
        boring here now,

393
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:20,177
       but at least you're
       not in a cage!

394
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,255
         Hey neighbour,
        wanna be friends..?
