1
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:03,769
      Morning, Pinkie Pie.

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,405
       Get your Ponyville
      Chronicle right here!

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,605
        Fan-tizzy-astic!

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,979
 I just love to read about happy
 happenings and it's always good

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,682
         to be a pony in
       the know, you know?

6
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,285
  And there's so much to know!

7
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:22,488
      Uh. Seems like a bunch of
       boring hooey to me.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,824
       Does "NEW SHRUBBERY
       IN CASTLE GARDEN"!

9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,626
        sound like boring
          hooey to you?

10
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,595
     Snooze.

11
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:30,696
          What about...

12
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,399
   "PARASPRITE INFESTATION IN
    FILLYDELPHIA ERADICATED"?

13
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,302
       Ah! That's great news!

14
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:41,140
      Ehhhh. Another day, another
     parasprite hype story.

15
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,809
          Noodles named official
           food of Whinnyapolis!

16
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,412
           Author A.K. Yearling
           announces retirement!

17
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,380
           Cloudsdale election
        heating up for candidate

18
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,715
                   in favor of
                cooling it down!

19
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,583
     WHAT? Let me see that!

20
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:55,153
        I never knew you were so
         into politics, Rainbow.

21
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,955
            No, this!

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,024
       It CAN'T be true...

23
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,326
   I'd have never have picked
  noodles as the official food

24
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,427
    of Whinnyapolis, either.

25
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,263
        But... here we are!

26
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,764
           No, Pinkie!

27
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:06,932
       I can't believe...

28
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,400
   that the greatest author...

29
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,136
         and secret pony
    adventurer of all time...

30
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,873
  A.K. Yearling... is retiring!

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,949
       A.K. Yearling just
      retired, like, today.

32
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,685
Are you sure she wants visitors?

33
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,654
    Pinkie, the A.K. Yearling
     I know would never quit

34
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,323
   and retire out of the blue!

35
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:05,891
         Something could
         be really wrong

36
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,826
       and we need to make
         sure she's OK.

37
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:08,494
               OK!

38
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,663
Hey.... you're not just trying
to make sure she writes

39
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,166
more Daring Do
books, are you?

40
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,635
                Of course not!

41
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,570
               But that wouldn't
                 hurt either.

42
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:19,604
                   Now, come on!

43
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,245
    Uh.. maybe she's not home.

44
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,647
      Maybe she went to the
     editor-in-chief of the

45
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,349
     Ponyville Chronicle to
 correct the misprint they've made!

46
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,584
Pinkie: Nope. She's home.

47
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:33,618
        How do you know?

48
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,886
Because she's right there...

49
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,355
looking all sad and alone.

50
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,856
                  Ah! I knew it!

51
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,558
             Something is wrong!

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,392
              A.K!

53
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,561
     Now she's sighing with
    the weight of the world.

54
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,531
      Now she's hanging her
     head in utter despair!

55
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,899
   Now she's shaking her hoof
     and cursing the heavens

56
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,935
     like nothing could ever
   possibly be the same again!

57
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,270
Why oh why did this
happen to her!?

58
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:52,871
                      What!?

59
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,072
             Whoops.

60
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,842
      Never mind, that time
    she was just stretching. Heh.

61
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:01,212
     A.K., it's us! Rainbow
      Dash and Pinkie Pie!

62
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,647
          Your friends!

63
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,290
  Oh, no. Did somepony ransack
       your cottage again

64
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,092
     and steal some ancient
        mysterious relic

65
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,027
    that's the key to saving
        all of Equestria!?

66
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,296
                   Oooh! Sparky!

67
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,003
     Nothing's been stolen..

68
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,672
Then is somepony blackmailing
you and forcing you to retire?

69
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,307
Cause if they are...

70
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,911
     No. Nothing like that.

71
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,413
So.. you're just quitting
and moving away!?

72
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,650
WHY. WOULD. YOU. DO. THAT?

73
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,287
 I already explained everything
   to the Ponyville Chronicle.

74
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,789
           Oh, really?

75
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,892
      "Author A.K. Yearling
       announced yesterday

76
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,828
  that the next adventure novel
     in her popular series,

77
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,263
    'Daring Do and the Curse
     of the Pharaoh's Tomb'

78
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,899
        will be her last.

79
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,435
     Yearling looks forward
       to her retirement."

80
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,937
          That doesn't
        explain anything!

81
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,808
It just says you're
giving up writing stories.

82
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,244
But most ponies don't know that
you actually are Daring Do

83
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,846
and that the
stories are real.

84
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,115
So what you're REALLY saying
is that you're giving up

85
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,918
being Daring Do, but
you're not saying why!

86
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,886
     Of course, if you don't
   feel like talking about it,

87
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,255
       that's A-OK, A.K.!

88
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,025
       As your friends, we
     completely understand.

89
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,427
      Right, Rainbow Dash?

90
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,131
    Oh. Yeah. We just came to
   make sure you're all right.

91
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,101
   That's.. really why we wanted
  to find out what's going on.

92
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,537
If you really
want to know...

93
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,474
   My last quest took me to a
  village in Southern Equestria

94
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,142
  where I started seeing.. these.

95
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:41,046
      "WAKE OF DESTRUCTION:

96

97
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,518
"DARE OR SCARE?

98
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,422

99
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,892
"DARING DO LEADS BULL INTO CHINA
 SHOP DURING HIGH SPEED CHASE--"

100
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:54,826
         That's enough!

101
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:58,630
      Everypony I tried to
       help is mad at me.

102
00:04:58,832 --> 00:04:59,564
                That's not true!

103
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,166
                They're not mad
               at A.K. Yearling.

104
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,168
                  They're mad at
                   "Daring Do".

105
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,071
They don't sell my books
in Southern Equestria.

106
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,274
The ponies there don't
know who A.K. Yearling is.

107
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,810
They only know Daring Do

108
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:15,113
and apparently she does
more harm than good.

109
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,415
     And I guess it's a good thing
      you look so different

110
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,850
        as A.K. Yearling!

111
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,119
        So all we have to
       do is go down there

112
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,055
and explain to these ponies that
   none of this stuff is true.

113
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,924
              Easy-peazy-cheezy!

114
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,160
But that's just the thing...

115
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,261
...it<i> is</i> true.

116
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,363
              WHAT?

117
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,398
       I guess I've always
         been so focused

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,034
   on saving priceless relics
    and stopping the bad guys

119
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,538
   that.. I never really thought
 about the mess I leave behind.

120
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,007
         Then you ARE in
        a tricky pickle.

121
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,910
       But.. why is all this
         happening now?

122
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,046
Ah.. I guess ponies are
finally fed up.

123
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:52,684
Either way, I'm done with
adventures: having or writing.

124
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:53,919
            Come on!

125
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,587
          For every one
        pony who's upset,

126
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,557
there must be at least a hundred
    that know you're a hero.

127
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,426
I don't think so, Dash.

128
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:06,164
   Well, why don't we go visit
    this village "Somnambula"

129
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,799
     and see for ourselves?

130
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,934
Those articles seem to
make it pretty clear

131
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,303
how the villagers feel.

132
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,639
 But if we go there, the ponies
     can tell you in person

133
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,875
       just how much they
         appreciate you.

134
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,611
 And what a heap of rotten apple
    cores these articles are!

135
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,382
      You really think so?

136
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:24,983
           I know so!

137
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,417
            Let's go!

138
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,935
        Mmmmmm! This is so cool!

139
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,471
     It looks just like that
    village in your last book

140
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,673
    where Daring Do recovers
        the Doomed Diadem

141
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,075
    from The Wild Bunch Gang

142
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,876
       who chase after her
       through the desert!

143
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,878
  It should.

144
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,647
I based that entire chapter
on my experiences here

145
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,048
in Somnambula.

146
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,818
        What happens? No
      wait, don't tell me.

147
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,620
I CHANGED MY MIND! TELL ME!

148
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,756
  Daring Do thwarts Ahuizotl's
      evil plot to separate

149
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,324
    the Sister Crown Relics.

150
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,027
  And if it wasn't for her, the
     region would be cursed

151
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,597
   with eternal night and the
    entire town of Somnambula

152
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,433
         would have sunk
        into the ground!

153
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,268
      Ah Pssht! There's no
    chance that these ponies

154
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,837
   don't think you're a hero.

155
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,506
                 Watch this.

156
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,110
             Hiya there, Mister!

157
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:30,081
 I was hoping you could tell me
  about a pony named Daring Do.

158
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,051
     I hear she's an awesome
      adventure-pony hero.

159
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,519
     Daring Do?

160
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,756
Oh, she's awesome, all right.

161
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,391
Awesome at destroying
ponies' apple carts

162
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,895
         and priceless,
         sacred statues!

163
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,733
Indeed. Daring
Do is a menace

164
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,336
who destroys everything
     she touches!

165
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,507
    What? No!

166
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,210
Daring Do is the exact
opposite of a menace.

167
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,179
            Ugh. I tried to tell you!

168
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,348
                Coming back here
                 was a mistake!

169
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,991
      Come on, A.K.! So we
      picked a bad example.

170
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,026
  That was just one angry pony!

171
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,695
        Two angry ponies!

172
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:17,996
       It doesn't matter.

173
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,865
         I never should
       have come with you!

174
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,800
  You two should just go home.

175
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,904
        Come on! We gotta
           follow her!

176
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,139
           I dunno...

177
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,574
      it really seemed like
       she doesn't want us

178
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,243
      cramping her saddle.

179
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,813
   But we have to convince her
 that ponies do appreciate her!

180
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,216
    As her friend, I have to
  make sure she believes that.

181
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,489
       Ooh. Look, Pinkie! It's
        the "Get On Inn".

182
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,293
    Daring Do stays here all
   the time in her adventures.

183
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,997
    Which means there must be
 ponies here who love Daring Do!

184
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,365
     Maybe they can help us.

185
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,033
             Mmmmm.

186
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,037
    My nose is telling me to
     help myself to muffins.

187
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,340
            Come on...

188
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,177
Ooo, she's fancy.

189
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,379
I got this!

190
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,981
A good evening
to you, Madame!

191
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,218
We are but weary travelers who
humbly wish to inquire

192
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,720
       on the status of a
    certain mare of intrigue

193
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,522
     taking residence here.

194
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,725
   What in Southern Equestria
        are you on about?

195
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,894
         Is it true that
      Daring Do stays here?

196
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,330
   Ha! Not anymore, she doesn't!

197
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,299
              Why not?

198
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,168
     The last time I rented
       that rascal a room,

199
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,637
   she was in a such a rush to
    high-tail it outta here,

200
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,205
  she didn't even pay her bill!

201
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,342
But--
      After that, a band of
      ruffians showed up

202
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,378
     and destroyed half the
     rooms looking for her.

203
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,547
    Guess she made them even
   more mad than she made me!

204
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,716
No, no, no. You've
 got it all wrong.

205
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,785
               Huh! How do ya figure?

206
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,554
     Daring Do was trying to
     save everypony from the

207
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,324
       Curse of the Doomed
        Diadem of Xilati!

208
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,327
   And she was only in a rush
because she had to get the crown

209
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,431
  back to the Tiara of Teotlale
  before the curse took effect.

210
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,266
       Chapter seventeen.

211
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,102
 Sounds like a tall tale to me.

212
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,871
  And a hard one to believe now
      that I know Daring Do

213
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,042
   is a scoundrel and a thief!

214
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:14,346
   Every year, ponies come to
     offer precious glowpaz

215
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,881
        to the Sonmambula
      statue in the village

216
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,950
   in hopes for a good future.

217
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,853
     Why that poor fella had
      his glowpaz necklace

218
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,290
       stolen by Daring Do
         just yesterday!

219
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,491
             Hmmmm.

220
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,128
                   THERE'S A.K.!

221
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:36,535
  Daring Do RUINED our town and
   stole our precious glowpaz!

222
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,704
    We need to make sure that
     if she turns up again,

223
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,973
   there will be consequences!

224
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:46,377
    Everypony who's with me,
  meet at the statue tomorrow!

225
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,882
   [sigh] Now I'm getting blamed for
    things I didn't even do?

226
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,584
  Why would I steal from them?

227
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,220
       They are SUPER BAD!

228
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,155
       But... we're still
    staying the night, right?

229
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,392
    Because I already ate all
     the free mini muffins!

230
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,729
      Listen, A.K., after a
       good night's sleep,

231
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,464
       we're going to fix
          all of this.

232
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,632
                   I promise.

233
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,605
I shouldn't be
here, Rainbow Dash.

234
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,073
This is never
going to work.

235
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,608
       Of course it will!

236
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,545
    All I have to do is go up
 there and explain to everypony

237
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,447
     how wrong they all are.

238
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,684
Yeah! And then I'll be
like what she said!

239
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,620
              [sigh] Easy-peazy-cheezy.

240
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,021
Exactly!

241
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,590
               Here it is! The
               remains of your--

242
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,327
           I mean our
       Somnambula statue.

243
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,196
     Now that Daring Do has
    destroyed it, tell me...

244
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,966
 where will we hang our glowpaz?

245
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,902
 We don't even have any glowpaz
    because they were stolen

246
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,270
          by Daring Do!

247
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,477
         Daring Do would
      never steal anything!

248
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,146
      And OK, she destroyed
          your statue,

249
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,282
   but it was because she was
     trying to save you all

250
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,650
         from Ahuizotl!

251
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,554
            Ahuizotl?

252
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:03,622
       He's about yay big?

253
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,555
           Long neck?

254
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,290
        Itty-bitty face?

255
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,924
 Weird claw thingy on his tail?

256
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,730
      Ooo! Ooo! I know him!
         He's a baddie.

257
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,638
Trust me, if Ahuizotl had gotten
away with the Doomed Diadem,

258
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,073
your entire village would
have been swallowed up!

259
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,710
   And that's a lot worse than
 losing some CRUMMY old statue!

260
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,913
                   Ahem!

261
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,949
               This was not some
              crummy old statue.

262
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,118
       It was the namesake
          of our town.

263
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,455
If you want to understand us,
you must first understand her.

264
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,123
                       Who?

265
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,558
          Somnambula...

266
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,429
   <i> Long ago this village fell</i>
     <i> prey to an evil Sphinx</i>

267
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,832
       <i> who demanded most</i>
        <i> of their crops.</i>

268
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,503
   <i> Like her fellow villagers,</i>
  <i> Somnambula didn't have much,</i>

269
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,707
  <i> but she used what she had to</i>
<i>keep others from giving up hope.</i>

270
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,577
         <i> The son of the</i>
     <i> Pharaoh, Prince Hisan,</i>

271
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,780
        <i> was so moved by</i>
        <i> her compassion,</i>

272
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:05,850
     <i> that he decreed nopony</i>
     <i> would go hungry again.</i>

273
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,326
      <i> But when Hisan stood</i>
       <i> up to the Sphinx,</i>

274
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,230
<i>the beast captured him, telling</i>
    <i> the Pharaoh the only way</i>

275
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,934
    <i> to get Hisan back was to</i>
       <i> solve her riddle.</i>

276
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,504
     <i> Nopony would volunteer</i>
      <i> to save the prince.</i>

277
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,841
   <i> Nopony except Somnambula.</i>

278
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,717
<i>The Sphinx gave her the riddle,</i>

279
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:44,789
<i>"I shine brightest in the dark.</i>
 <i> I am there but cannot be seen.</i>

280
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,025
 <i> To have me costs you nothing.</i>

281
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,929
     <i> To be without me costs</i>
        <i> you everything."</i>

282
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,398
     <i> As Somnambula thought</i>
        <i> of the hardship</i>

283
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,368
       <i> she and her fellow</i>
   <i> villagers had experienced,</i>

284
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,803
         <i> she instantly</i>
        <i> knew the answer.</i>

285
00:13:59,205 --> 00:13:59,838
         <i> "HOPE!"</i>

286
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,072
          <i> She shouted.</i>

287
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,844
 <i> The Sphinx was so enraged, it</i>
 <i> seemed she might still refuse</i>

288
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,178
     <i> to release the prince,</i>

289
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,182
    <i> so Somnambula asked her</i>
    <i> for one more challenge,</i>

290
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,951
           <i> but if she</i>
        <i> accomplished it,</i>

291
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,421
     <i> the Sphinx would leave</i>
   <i> from the kingdom forever.</i>

292
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,223
   <i> The Sphinx quickly agreed,</i>

293
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:21,526
  <i> asking only that Somnambula</i>
     <i> walk to the prince...</i>

294
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,964
       <i> ... across a deep</i>
      <i> chasm, blindfolded!</i>

295
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,467
    <i> Further, the Sphinx had</i>
     <i> cast a powerful spell</i>

296
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,970
         <i> that prevented</i>
    <i> Somnambula from flying.</i>

297
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,076
<i>But Somnambula never lost HOPE!</i>

298
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,245
     <i> She knew she'd need to</i>
      <i> make a leap of faith</i>

299
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,981
      <i> to save the prince.</i>

300
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,616
      <i> Guided by the sound</i>
    <i> of the prince's voice...</i>

301
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,289
   <i> she easily made it across.</i>

302
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,500
     <i> The Pharaoh asked how</i>
      <i> Somnambula prevailed</i>

303
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:04,469
     <i> and she explained that</i>
      <i> she had always hoped</i>

304
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,972
     <i> she could make things</i>
     <i> better for her people</i>

305
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:10,175
         <i> and that hope</i>
    <i> had carried her through.</i>

306
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,678
    <i> The Prince replaced the</i>
   <i> pearls Somnambula gave up</i>

307
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,014
   <i> with a string of Glowpaz.</i>

308
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,517
   <i> And around her neck, they</i>
      <i> glowed bright enough</i>

309
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,487
  <i> to light the entire kingdom.</i>

310
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:27,892
     <i> Forever after, Glowpaz</i>
   <i> became our symbol of hope.</i>

311
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:34,099
 Wow. I had no idea how special
     the statue was to you.

312
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,868
     Somnambula sounds like
       a pretty cool pony.

313
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,603
   But I bet if she were here,

314
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:41,139
     she'd tell you how cool
        Daring Do is too

315
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,441
      because they've both
  fought to protect this town!

316
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:49,214
If Somnambula were here today,
she would condemn Daring Do

317
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:52,584
       for destroying yo--
       OUR symbol of hope!

318
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,198
           Hey, buddy!

319
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,602
What did Daring Do ever do
to you to deserve all this?

320
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,405
       Only... everything!

321
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,541
         Dr. Caballeron!?

322
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,977
            Yes... Rainbow Dash.

323
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,883
         When I saw you,
       her closest friend,

324
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,752
      I knew that Daring Do
    would not be far behind.

325
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:31,556
     I really do owe you for
    leading her right to me.

326
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,924
But I didn't mean--

327
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,426
    Thank you for helping me
    break Daring Do's spirit

328
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,428
          by destroying
         her reputation,

329
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,932
  but I can't have you running
  off and telling her my plan.

330
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,639
              HELP!

331
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,209
Caballeron?

332
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,376
        No!

333
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,711
          He's got Rainbow Dash!

334
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:54,779
                   Come on!

335
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:05,589
        I'm... coming...
       Rainbow... Dash...

336
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,426
              Oh! I knew you'd come!

337
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,727
You did?

338
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,862
I sure didn't.

339
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,763
What if I cause
 more trouble?

340
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,831
           You won't.

341
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:14,899
        How do you know?

342
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,034
                I just do!

343
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,202
       You wouldn't let anything
        happen to Rainbow Dash.

344
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,971
              You care too much.

345
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,305
          You're right.

346
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,640
     Which way did they go?

347
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,445
         To the pyramid!

348
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,714
      Dash: Somepony help!

349
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,319
      Dash: Somepony! Anypony!

350
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,654
     Pinkie Pie! Daring Do!

351
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:37,922
          Is that you?

352
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,190
Don't worry, Rainbow!

353
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,891
We'll save you!

354
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,702
If my previous plan didn't cause
   you to give up, Daring Do,

355
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:54,405
  then the shame of losing your
    dear friend Rainbow Dash

356
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,140
       to the slime will!

357
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:02,480
   Oh, and that ancient magic
    from the legend is real.

358
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,049
      There'll be no flying
         in the pyramid!

359
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,485
      Good luck, Daring Do!

360
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,695
     He's right! We'll never
       get to her in time!

361
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,231
     If this really is like
       Somnambula's story,

362
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,700
      then we just have to
     have hope that we can!

363
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,903
I think we need more
than hope, Pinkie.

364
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,672
There was a bridge in the story
and there's no bridge here.

365
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,273
    What are we going to do?

366
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,911
    I don't know, but Rainbow
       Dash is our friend!

367
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,014
    Just like Somnambula. We
  need to make a leap of faith

368
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,949
 and hope that we can save her!

369
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,218
             PINKIE!

370
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,157
A-ha!

371
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,725
             Wheeee! Hee hee hee!

372
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,031
              I knew we'd do it!

373
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,700
Thanks for reminding me to
never give up hope, Pinkie.

374
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,103
    And I'm kinda hoping you
      ponies will untie me

375
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,106
    before we all take a bath
    in bubbling green slime!

376
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,276
          We're on it!

377
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,994
    Not so fast, Caballeron!

378
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,534
YOU stole our glowpaz!

379
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,041
I should have known you were
just trying to sully my name

380
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,844
so that you'd be free to
steal whatever you wanted.

381
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,747
       Of course that was
      the plan, Daring Do!

382
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,483
         At first I just
      wanted the Glowpaz...

383
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:50,688
But then I saw an opportunity to
   write you out of the story

384
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,690
            FOR GOOD!

385
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,262
        And with the destruction
         you leave in your wake,

386
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,464
         it didn't take too much
           to convince ponies

387
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,567
             you were a villain!

388
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,069
You're wrong, Caballeron.

389
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,438
And I won't let you
break my spirit again.

390
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,807
Because I'm never
going to give up hope

391
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,576
that I can protect ponies
and ancient treasures

392
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,712
from miscreants like you!

393
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,684
          Remember! She
       ruined your statue!

394
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,352
         You're fools to
         believe in her!

395
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,860
 Grrrr! You'll pay for this, Daring Do!

396
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,166
      OK, OK that's enough!

397
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,271
Thanks for helping
me come to my senses.

398
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:41,972
You two are true friends.

399
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,307
                Are you kidding?

400
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,208
              That.

401
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,075
              Was.

402
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,377
            Awesome!

403
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,346
   We're just glad you're back
     to your old self again!

404
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,149
[giggle] Me too!

405
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,684
  But I'm glad I realized that
     even if you're fighting

406
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:57,455
for something good, you're still
  responsible for your actions.

407
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,025
  And if something bad happens
     that you didn't intend,

408
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,328
   you shouldn't give up hope
   or lose faith in yourself.

409
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,632
Yeah! All ya gotta do
is make it right.

410
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,001
           Feel free to use that
            in your next book!

411
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,170
You know, I think I will.
