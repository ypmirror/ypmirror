1
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,946
        You said it,
         Big Mac!

2
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,015
     This is taking FOREVER!

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,183
        I know it's wrong
         to cut corners

4
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,585
      when it comes to
      gifts from the heart,

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,786
      but this is
      an emergency, right?

6
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:22,554
              Eyup.

7
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:23,589
            Discord?

8
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:24,790
         A little help?

9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,158
            DISCORD!

10
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,064
           Good idea! Heh.

11
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,183
              Ahem.

12
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:36,301
     "Captain Wuzz, are you
   prepared to enter the world

13
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,470
     of Ogres & Oubliettes?"

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,173
   Huzzah, fellow adventurers!

15
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:44,043
   Shall we storm the ramparts
    of Squizard's Castle

16
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,312
   to reclaim Calico's Ring of
    Imperceptibility?

17
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,551
      You did summon me for
      a rousing Guys' Night

18
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,020
    of Ogres and Oubliettes,
      did you not?

19
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,456
       Uh. Sort of, but...

20
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,991
   Do you think you could
   magically hurry-up this pie

21
00:00:59,093 --> 00:00:59,959
        real quick first?

22
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,395
      You seem to be mixing
      up the Lord of Chaos

23
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,899
    with a second-rate clown
      magician for hire.

24
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,700
                       Uh! WAIT!

25
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,402
       This needs to go in
       the mail today

26
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,654
       or it'll never get
        to Sugar Belle

27
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:13,405
       in time for Hearts
        and Hooves Day.

28
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:19,178
Please, can't you see that that
holiday is a commercialized ruse

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,414
      pushed on you by the
     greeting card industry?

30
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,682
Big Mac: Ahem!

31
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,387
              Fine...

32
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,055
      You owe me for this.

33
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,896
    Keep your eye on the pie.

34
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,999
        It's magic time!

35
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,011
    This smells... palatable.

36
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,947
Well, pies really are
Sugar Belle's thing.

37
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,183
   But I think that makes
   this all the more special.

38
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,385
   It shows you're interested
    in what she cares about.

39
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,504
              Eyup.

40
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:36,622
       And, he's planning
       a big romantic

41
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,074
    Hearts and Hooves dinner.

42
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,425
It was my idea to bake
the invitation inside.

43
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,697
     "Happy Hearts and
    Hooves Day, Sugar Belle.

44
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:50,201
      Meet me in my barn at
     sunset for a surprise."

45
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,636
           Pretty clever,
           huh?

46
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,705
Eyup.
[giggle]

47
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,383
 Aw, "Sugar
Belle." See?

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,752
     Well, you two certainly
      have bought into this

49
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,722
     romance nonsense hook,
      line, and sinker.

50
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,024
    For a formerly-friendless
      immortal despot,

51
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,459
     you're pretty cynical.

52
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,845
         I'm a realist.

53
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,730
   And love, like all things
   warm and fuzzy, isn't real.

54
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,735
      Aw, come on. You act
      tough, but deep down

55
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,104
        you're a softie.

56
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,472
 I mean, you don't have tea with
 Fluttershy every weekend

57
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,207
      because you like tea.

58
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,176
       But I do like tea!

59
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:31,943
           Every tea.

60
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,279
          All the teas.

61
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,115
  Chamomile, Earl Gray, green,
   white, yellow, maté, lemon,

62
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,220
    ginger, chai, spearmint,
    peppermint, hibiscus,

63
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,656
     cinnamon pumpkin spice!

64
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,994
        Tell you what:
       while Big Mac mails

65
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,696
         his incredibly
        romantic gesture,

66
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,797
   I'll show you the splendors
    of Hearts and Hooves Day

67
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,850
          in Ponyville.

68
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:56,101
      I bet I can prove
      you believe in love.

69
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,504
       Fine. Call it a
       gentleman's wager.

70
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,874
Loser mows my lawn
for eternity.

71
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,479
       Is it like a riding
        mower, or...?

72
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,947
Tweezers!

73
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,976
        Apple Bloom: Hear ye, hear ye!

74
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,911
       This special Hearts
     and Hooves Day meetin'

75
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,182
   of the Cutie Mark Crusaders
     is now in session!

76
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,818
First order of business: helpin'
my big brother decorate the barn

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,488
   for his big date with
    Sugar Belle tonight and--

78
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:51,977
             Hello?

79
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:57,061
    It seems like everypony's
  got somepony special but us!

80
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,631
 When's it going to be our turn?

81
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,765
         [knock at door]
            Huh?

82
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,769
              Huh?

83
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,104
                  [gasp] Who's it from?

84
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,524
    Can't tell.

85
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:12,243
 It's all smudged, but it looks
 like it's addressed to "Belle".

86
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,514
     Hmmm... SWEETIE BELLE!

87
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:23,622
 Somepony certainly went through
  a lot of trouble.. for me

88
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,157
    on Hearts and Hooves Day!

89
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,295
  [gasp] You don't think...? Could
   it be...? Hang on a minute.

90
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:35,567
  Mysterious package, smudged
 address, no idea who it's from?

91
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,669
      I know what this is.

92
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,539
  YOU'VE GOT A SECRET ADMIRER!

93
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,250
      Spike: Ah! Another
    Hearts and Hooves Day.

94
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,152
  Love is in the air, Discord.

95
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,887
Look at all these happy couples.

96
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,023
    How can they be happy if
     they aren't playing

97
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,891
      Ogres and Oubliettes?

98
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,928
   As a great Dragon poet once
      wrote to his beloved:

99
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,831
        "I love you with
       the utmost clarity;

100
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,334
      I love you, dear, my
      sweet, sweet Rari--"

101
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,902
     Are you even listening?

102
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,538
           Of course.

103
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,973
  "Love is something-something,
    and Discord is great."

104
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,175
          I don't know.

105
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,044
     Can we play O & O now?

106
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,113
    Sure, after you admit you
      believe in love and--

107
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,248
           SUGAR BELLE!

108
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,886
      Big Mac's girlfriend.

109
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,989
        What's she doing
        in town so early?

110
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,993
 Well, Sugar Belle, I'm sure
 Big Mac won't be expecting it.

111
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:39,130
  She's planning her own
 romantic surprise for Big Mac?

112
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,599
       What if she goes to
        Sweet Apple Acres

113
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,567
     before Big Mac's ready
       with his surprise?

114
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,902
     We've got to warn him!

115
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,840
          Whoa! [clang]

116
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,208
                   Whoa!

117
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,413
       Mig Back! Mig Back!

118
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,315
         I mean Big Mac!

119
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,650
    We just saw Sugar Belle.

120
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,252
   She's at Sugarcube Corner,

121
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,553
      but I think she's on
     her way over here now!

122
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,123
  You gotta keep her away from
 here until the barn's finished!

123
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,291
              [gasp] Eyup!

124
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,595
      I wonder what she
      has planned for him.

125
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,565
       [chuckle] We don't
         have to wonder.

126
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,568
              Agh!

127
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,005
      Will you WARN me next
        time you do that?

128
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,750
Oh, she hasn't seen him yet.

129
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,184
       Take note, Discord.

130
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,587
 This is what love is all about!

131
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,259
    Spike, "Love is about
     spying in the bushes."

132
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,861
Make fun of me
all you want,

133
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,395
but look at
Big Mac's face

134
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,231
and tell me you don't
believe in love.

135
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,171
I hope he'll be
OK without me.

136
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,010
            Oh, hey.

137
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,045
          We're just...

138
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,279
           not spying.
      Hush!

139
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,452
       I mean, he has been
       on his own before,

140
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,421
    so he'll be fine, right?

141
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,558
        How should I tell
        Big Mac tonight?

142
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,861
  "You won't need to come visit
   me in my village anymore"?

143
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,664
       "We need to talk."

144
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,966
Just be honest
with him.

145
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,735
        You're right, OK.

146
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,036
        "We're finished."

147
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,578
               You're right. She
               DID surprise him.

148
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,713
              Agh!

149
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,658
    OK. Things seem bad;
    maybe they're really not.

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,127
     Maybe "we're finished"
       was about the day.

151
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,395
     Ponies say that, right?
 Like, "Hey, remember yesterday?

152
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,399
        That's finished.
       Cause it's today."

153
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:56,868
         Maybe not that.

154
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,971
    Oooh! I know. Maybe Sugar
    Belle has a wacky cousin

155
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,232
   who's never been on his own

156
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,792
    and she has to leave him
    in charge of her shop

157
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:04,352
      while she apprentices
         with Mrs. Cake,

158
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:07,212
  who does that, like, two days
     a week. No, no, three.

159
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,648
  That's why she won't need you
 to come to her village anymore.

160
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,184
 Because she'll already be here!

161
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,554
Nah. I don't even
buy that one.

162
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,494
         She takes pie
        baking seriously.

163
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,996
        Why'd I even try?

164
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,166
     I bet she thought I
     was making fun of her.

165
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,972
Oh, I hate seeing you
 like this, Big Mac,

166
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,341
         and over a
         girl, no less.

167
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,879
 I'm calling an emergency Guys'
Night right now to cheer you up.

168
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,418
   Besides, we can't have
   you ruining any more of my

169
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,222
    1000-year-old monogrammed
       handkerchiefs.

170
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,957
    These are silk, you know.

171
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,432
    Class is now in session.

172
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,867
       Lesson one: Nothing
      can break your heart

173
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,136
   if you only love yourself.

174
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,039
  You've got to show everypony
    that you're too cool

175
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,609
  to be bothered with so-called
     "love." Observe.

176
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:17,616
      This is how cool guys
      lean against things.

177
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,418
   When you see a guy leaning
     against a thing

178
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,587
  looking this cool, you think,

179
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,891
    "Wow, that guy doesn't
    have a care in Equestria.

180
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,429
     Not a guy who leans
      on things that cool!"

181
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,698
      I don't think leaning
         is gonna help.

182
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,599
      Am I doing it right?

183
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,133
              WHOA!

184
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:35,934
              OOF!

185
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,139
  We're not like you, Discord.

186
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,374
     We can't put on a front
    and pretend not to love.

187
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,543
        It's impossible.

188
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,946
Lesson two: Plenty of
ponies in the pasture.

189
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,215
Right, Big Mac?

190
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,983
I know just the gal to make you
forget all about Sugar Belle!

191
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:57,488
       YOU SAID HER NAME!

192
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,323
    Oy vey.

193
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,426
   OK! We finished decoratin'
     the barn for Big Mac,

194
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,830
   which means we got the rest
    of the day to ourselves.

195
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,399
   There's a whole town of
   possible admirers out there

196
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,135
      and only three of us.

197
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,304
  But together, we're gonna
   get to the bottom of this.

198
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,039
          Ready? BREAK!

199
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,575
      Excuse me, Pipsqueak?

200
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,177
 Mind answerin' a few questions?

201
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,045
     No? Late for something?

202
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,348
     Are you Sweetie-Belle's
      secret admirer!?

203
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,617
 Excuse me, I'm doing a research
  survey about sending pie

204
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,886
    in the mail anonymously.

205
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,454
    Would you say you're pro
     "that," or anti "that?"

206
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,457
Happy Hearts and Hooves Day.

207
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,426
Did you boys happen to send
any packages to me recently?

208
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,897
It's OK to say no;
I won't be offended.

209
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,132
Please say no, please
say no, please say no.

210
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,739
 Sir McBiggun, meet Skellinore.

211
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,709
  She's a level-18 Bone-Warrior
    in Squizard's Mage Army,

212
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,579
   but only to pay off
  Skeleton Student Loan Debts.

213
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,015
      Get to know each
      other, why don't you?

214
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,585
  Wow! You're really going
  all-out to cheer up Big Mac;

215
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,786
         I'm impressed.

216
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,588
     Yes, yes, I'm amazing.

217
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,756
     Anyway, since we're
      in the neighborhood,

218
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,459
    care for a quick game
    of Ogres and Oubliettes?

219
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,930
     Like I've been wanting
      to PLAY ALL WEEK?

220
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,449
         I take it back.

221
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,067
     I'm helping our friend,
     first and foremost.

222
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,869
        See for yourself.

223
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,711
    I think he's showing her
    a picture of Sugar Belle.

224
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,529
    What?

225
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,846
      And now he's crying.

226
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,215
       No no no no no no!

227
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,950
 No, he's not. Let me see that.

228
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:32,817
         Don't touch it.

229
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,652
          I'm looking!

230
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,953
Give me-
             Cut it out, Discord!

231
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:35,854
            Quit it!

232
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,441
-used to do this thing

233
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,184
    where her nose would
    wrinkle when she laughed.

234
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:43,827
    Right there in that hole
   where your nose used to be.

235
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,533
 I never told her how much I
 loved Wrinkle Nose Cutie Face.

236
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,168
      AND NOW I NEVER WILL!

237
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:52,872
                    Agh.

238
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,578
 OK. I think we've had enough of
   the aloof Master of Chaos'

239
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,247
  remedies for a broken heart.

240
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,784
 You know what I do when I have
   a problem too big to solve?

241
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,870
                 I hide from it.

242
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:11,055
 When she can't find you, she'll
realize how much she misses you!

243
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:15,160
  Plus, if she can't find you,
  she can't break up with you!

244
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,628
              Eyup!

245
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,035
         I don't get it.

246
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,438
      We asked every
     stallion in Ponyville.

247
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,507
    Ugh. There's got to be
     somepony we're missin'.

248
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,110
        Somepony obvious.

249
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,712
       Somepony RIGHT in
       front of our NOSES!

250
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,065
            Oh, well.

251
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,917
   At least the barn's looking
    great for Big Mac's date.

252
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,557
 Too bad there won't be a date.

253
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,693
   Sugar Belle is so lucky to
   have a "non-secret admirer"

254
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:49,962
          like Big Mac.

255
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,130
  Well, she certainly doesn't
  seem to have appreciated it.

256
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,034
Apple Bloom: I bet she's gonna take one look
   at this barn and say

257
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,469
       "What did I ever do
        to deserve this?"

258
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,639
        Yes, what did she
       do to deserve this?

259
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,308
       She broke my heart.

260
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,177
         Well, not yet.

261
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,564
          Technically.

262
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:12,050
In fact, she can't break your
 heart if you break hers first.

263
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,552
             Eeeyup!

264
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,821
  Sugar Belle: Thanks for the
   tour of Ponyville, Mrs. Cake.

265
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,957
Oh, my pleasure.

266
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,559
       I'm off to surprise
     Big Mac with the news!

267
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,362
     Imagine the look on his
     face when I tell him:

268
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,830
       "We need to talk."

269
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,865
        Oh, dear me, no!

270
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,967
I told you, don't
say it that way

271
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,836
or he'll think you're
breaking up with him!

272
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,271
       Break up with him?

273
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,239
             Never!

274
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,606
     Why, without my
     favorite delivery pony,

275
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,110
       I couldn't imagine
     being happy ever again.

276
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,478
         He knows that.

277
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,947
Good. Save your mix-ups
   for cake batter;

278
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,382
    that's what I always say.

279
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,417
         Ha ha ha!

280
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,251
        He's a good
      listener, that pony.

281
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,620
   I promise you: no mix-ups.

282
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,256
 Ah! Big Mac!

283
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,858
          Sugar Belle?

284
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,426
        We need to talk.

285
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,700
                   I know why
                    you're here.

286
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,685
    You do?

287
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:06,069
            But I have something
             to tell YOU first.

288
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,438
Oh, can I go first?

289
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,573
I'm going to be--          Stop.

290
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,875
Oh. Why don't we tell
each other on three?

291
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:11,409
  One...

292
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,742
                    It's over.

293
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:13,911
   What's over?

294
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,247
                 You. And me.
                  It's over.

295
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,848
              Uh... what?

296
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,250
       We're breaking up.

297
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,786
I.. don't understand.

298
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,454
Why are you breaking
  up with me?

299
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,223
And why are you
leaning like that?

300
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,026
          I.... don't know!

301
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,995
   Big Mac, please talk to me.

302
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,864
                I-- you-- ARGH!

303
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,800
        This is why I
       don't like talking!

304
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:36,867
         Words can hurt!

305
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:37,969
           Words HURT!

306
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,904
      GOODBYE, SUGAR BELLE!

307
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,267
Big Mac!

308
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,102
       Oh, thank goodness.

309
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,703
  You gotta help us with this!

310
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,851
[rustling] Huh.

311
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,743
     Dude, how long have
      you been not-hiding?

312
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,012
      Oh. I should probably
      have said something.

313
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,314
Y'all should go.

314
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,150
  Did you... did
she... are you...?

315
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,354
    Big Mac? What's going on?

316
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,756
      Where's Sugar Belle?

317
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,458
            Just go.

318
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,394
       But we worked so
       hard on this chart.

319
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,563
  I think we've almost cracked
     it, if you could just--

320
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,865
       --not right now...

321
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,166
    But I can't stand having
      a secret admirer

322
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,435
       who's too scared to
       tell me who he is!

323
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,871
 Maybe he doesn't like TALKING.

324
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,806
But that doesn't make any sense!

325
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,474
        Maybe he used to
          talk too much

326
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,276
      and it only ever got
        him into trouble!

327
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,783
      [sigh] What if you're
       right, Discord?

328
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,185
 What if love isn't real at all?

329
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,710
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle.

330
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,094
I'm just mad and I'm
takin' it out on you.

331
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,014
                  That's OK.

332
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,932
      I bet if felt good to
       get it out, though.

333
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,000
        Actually, it did.

334
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,869
       Tellin' you how
        I felt just then.

335
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,737
           I gotta go!

336
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,650
            Big Mac!

337
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:21,362
      Where are you going?

338
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,274
  I gotta talk to Sugar Belle!

339
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,476
     Discord, you've got to
      use your magic and...

340
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,280
      Guess you have
      better things to do.

341
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,549
 Big Mac's gonna need a miracle.

342
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:42,893
     Of.... all the rotten luck.

343
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,139
Caught you just in time.

344
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,576
We both know I don't
like to say much,

345
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,246
but I'm going to
say something now.

346
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:02,023
Hmph.

347
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,182
    Even though I'm hurting,

348
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,651
I wouldn't trade this
feeling for anything,

349
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,687
because it'd mean giving up
the good times we had, too.

350
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,923
I only broke up
with you because

351
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,058
you were going to
break up with me.

352
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,927
I respect your decision,
but you should know

353
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,197
you'll always be
in my heart.

354
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,700
              I didn't want to
              break up with you.

355
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,369
But.. you said you don't
need me to visit anymore.

356
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,038
You said I'm gonna
be on my own.

357
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,774
I-I-I heard you said
"We're finished!"

358
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,475
when I was hiding
in the bushes.

359
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,245
That sounds worse
   than it is.

360
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:35,746
                  Oh, Big Mac...

361
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,515
          I was talking
        about my cousin!

362
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,451
  I have this wacky cousin
  who's never been on his own,

363
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,187
    but I have to let him
    run my shop on weekends.

364
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,356
      Which is why you
       won't be delivering

365
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,975
     to my village anymore.

366
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:49,693
  Because I'll already be here
  apprenticing with Mrs. Cake,

367
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,662
        who does that two
          days a week.

368
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,997
           No, three.

369
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,433
      Wait'll I tell Spike!

370
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,835
  I'd never break up with you.

371
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,344
 I suppose there's a lesson here
 somewhere about communication.

372
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,847
  Talking instead of assuming,
   or eavesdropping is wrong,

373
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,049
        wouldn't you say?

374
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,683
           Eyyyyyyup.

375
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,322
[chuckle] Wrinkle nose cutie face.

376
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,890
You must have been awful
confused at my breaking up

377
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,826
with you after
you got my pie.

378
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,161
            What pie?

379
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,862
You didn't get
the pie I sent?

380
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:25,647
                 Mm mm.

381
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,731
       Or the invitation?

382
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,633
                    Uh uh.

383
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,534
Well, in that case...

384
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,839
   Allow me to escort you to a
 Hearts and Hooves Day surprise!

385
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,082
       Mind if we join ya?

386
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,626
     "Happy Hearts and
    Hooves Day, Sugar Belle.

387
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,196
     Meet me--" SUGAR Belle!?

388
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,199
       You have GOT to be
       pullin' our hooves.

389
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,101
It was all a mix-up?

390
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,406
  Aw it's funny; I've been sitting
  here feeling sorry for myself

391
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,375
  for not having a special pony
   on Hearts and Hooves Day,

392
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,178
       but remembering all
        the fun we had,

393
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,847
       I think I have two
         special ponies.

394
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,417
      My two best friends.

395
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,684
              Awww.

396
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:27,190
     And so ends another
     Hearts and Hooves Day.

397
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,626
    Despite a bumpy start...

398
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,428
    and middle... and ending.

399
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,496
      A lot of bumps today.

400
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,698
      Love was in the air.

401
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,733
So was confusion,
 apparently.

402
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,436
And a fair number
 of assumptions.

403
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,255
     But YOU have to admit,

404
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:42,273
     after seeing everything
      Big Mac went through,

405
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,241
       love is one hundred
        percent real.

406
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,111
           Seriously?

      I can't believe you!

00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,016
   Who do you think broke
   Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?

    You old softie! Ha ha! I
    knew you had a heart!

413
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,797
Speaking of how great I am,

00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,899
are you busy for the
rest of the night?

  I thought you'd
    never ask.

419
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,379
      Oh, and just
      wondering, no biggie,

420
