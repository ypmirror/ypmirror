     find a SINGLE reference

95
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,749
       That book's <i>pretty</i>
        out of date,

96
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,750

          worth a try.

97

     are even less so.

414
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,224
        What do you mean?

415
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,360
  There's only one petal left,

416
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,796
    but I think the three of
    you know what to wish for

417
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,465
       and I'm pretty sure
      Starswirl won't mind.

418
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,569
  We wish we were foals again.

419
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,004
            [whoosh]

420
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,574
            [zapping]

421
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,250
       Hold on. You three are
       actually younger than us!?

422
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,252
        The flower turned
        us into grownups,

423
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,587
     so we figured we could
     do whatever we wanted,

424
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,990
       but I guess that's
        not exactly true.

425
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,960
     We did everything real
     grownups told us not to

426
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,961
        and caused all
        kinds of trouble.

427
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,030
      And things could have
        been a lot worse.

428
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,566
         I guess we <i>were</i>
         pretty selfish...

429
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,368
       I'm glad you
       learned something.

430
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,003
   That's what growing up is,

431
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:15,006
    which is why you probably
    shouldn't skip any of it.

432
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,708
      I know we didn't make
      the best impression,

433
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,811
  but we sure would like to
  visit you and Bloofy someday.

434
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,416
I guess that'd be
OK, on one condition:

435
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,119
      You get a REAL
      grownup to bring you.

436
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,253
              DEAL!

437
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:32,455
               [laughter]
