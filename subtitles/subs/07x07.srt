1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:09,508
       Scootaloo, is this
        such a... good idea?

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,143
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,312
This is the best
idea I've ever had!

4
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,248
           It's just--

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,051
--You wanna come. But
we talked about this.

6
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,653
Non-Pegasus ponies fall
through the clouds.

7
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,124
          Right, but--

8
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:26,993
       I think we're good.

9
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,195
             We are?

10
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,431
      Scootaloo, I know you
    have to go to Cloudsdale

11
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,600
     to finish your report;
       I'm just wondering

12
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,902
       if this is the best
        way to get there.

13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,606
     It'll be fine. Besides,
   how else could I get there?

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,241
              A Pegasus chariot.

15
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,509
A flock of birds!

16
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,044
              A hot air balloon.

17
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,813
 Huh, those do seem a lot safer.

18
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,781
       Maybe I should try
        to find another--

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,449
           --WAAAAYY!

20
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,554
             WOOHOO!

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,294
           Nailed it.

22
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,299
        Little ma'am, are
         you all right?

23
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:19,411
    You're-- you're-- you're
       Rainbow Dash's dad!

24
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,916
       Ah yes. Bow Hothoof
        at your service.

25
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,900
     Uh, honey, something's
       going on out here!

26
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:25,211
Oh, heavens to Celestia,
what's wrong with her?!

27
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,016
           I don't know, but you
            just made it worse.

28
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:35,387
    Sorry, it's just, you're
     RAINBOW DASH'S PARENTS!

29
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,958
           She's doing it again!

30
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,227
       Oh, dearie, please.

31
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,932
  You might shatter my Princess
 Celestia commemorative plates!

32
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:47,766
              Agh!

33
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,908
    I'm so sorry. I just... I
 can't believe I'm meeting you.

34
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,076
     My name's Scootaloo and
    I'm doing a school report

35
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,244
        on your daughter.

36
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,947
Our Rainbow Dash?

37
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,783
       The report's on an
 inspirational pony in my life.

38
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,352
      And no pony inspires
     me more than she does!

39
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,690
    I'm putting together this
    scrapbook for my report.

40
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,859
      I'm her biggest fan!

41
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,796
      Little trotter, what
    you say is impossible...

42
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:23,168
 because nopony is a bigger fan
  of our Rainbow Dash THAN US!

43
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:29,275
        Whoa. You always
        wear that shirt?

44
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:33,745
Actually it's er.. laundry day,
but pretty great, right?

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,680
                Yeah!

46
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,350
        My name's Windy Whistles
         and I just have to say

47
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,719
            that it is a total
          blast to meet somepony

48
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,889
            that loves Rainbow
          Dash as much as we do!

49
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,389
What can we help
    you with?

50
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:48,493
 Well, I know all about Rainbow
    Dash's time in Ponyville,

51
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,863
    but I don't know anything
   about her life before that.

52
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,999
Well, you came to
the right place.

53
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,408
   Windy: Here you go. Rainbow
      Dash's favorite meal.

54
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,245
       A pasta and potato
     sandwich on sourdough!

55
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,114
  She just LOVES to carbo load!

56
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:12,351
I can't believe I'm eating
Rainbow Dash's favorite food,

57
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,720
made by Rainbow Dash's mom,

58
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:18,023
while sitting in Rainbow
Dash's childhood kitchen!!

59
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,894
This is the greatest
day of my life!

60
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,399
Mm! Mmmmm!

61
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,836
I think it's time for
a tour of the house.

62
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,171
               OK!

63
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,875
  Our little Dashie was an early
  learner and so rambunctious.

64
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,211
     The combination was...

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,413
            EXCITING!

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,285
              Woah.

67
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,358
               Is that her room?

68
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,000
  Rainbow Dash's linen closet!

69
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,102
           Her carpet!

70
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,638
    Her inspirational poster!

71
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,474
   "When the going gets tough,
     the tough don't notice

72
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:13,478
 because they have hard shells."
     That's so Rainbow Dash.

73
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,318
             Woohoo!

74
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,721
Scootaloo, want to see
something really cool?

75
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,343
         I.. uhh.. installed the
          sound effects myself.

76
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,147
Pretty great, huh?

77
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,615
                       So great!

78
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,016
And look at this.

79
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,787
     She was wearing it when
   she spoke her first words.

80
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,422
            So cool!

81
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,562
And this broken lantern is from
when she first learned to fly.

82
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,569
And this bitten apple is from
when she grew her first tooth.

83
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,003
So many memories...

84
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,041
       You're so lucky to
       have all of these.

85
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,877
       Well, I may have a
       ton of Dash-mentos,

86
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,779
                but I don't have
                  any of those

87
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,416
    Rainbow Dash saves Ponyville
         headlines like you.

88
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,168
Tradesies?

89
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,285
                       Dealsies!

90
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,759
So where's all the
 Wonderbolt stuff?

91
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,796
         You mean.. Rainbow Dash's
           personal collection

92
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,499
      of Wonderbolt memorabilia?

93
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,001
   No, I mean where's all the
    stuff about Rainbow Dash

94
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,270
      getting accepted into
     the Wonderbolt Academy

95
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,572
        and then getting
     chosen as a Wonderbolt.

96
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,744
Wait, you don't know that
your daughter's a Wonderbolt?

97
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,147
And I got to tell you!

98
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,119
     Oh, wow, you should see
      your faces right now!

99
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,457
See that's what your
faces look like.

100
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,566
  Our daughter's a WONDERBOLT?!

101
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:18,637
          Great timing.

102
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,871
           Great door.

103
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,709
  I just... it's unbelievable!

104
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,279
You two were kind enough to show
  me the Rainbow Dash you know;

105
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:31,350
  now please, allow me to show
  you the Rainbow Dash I know.

106
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,961
        Let's make some thunder!

107
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,096
I was born to
make thunder!

108
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,036
      We've got turbulence!

109
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,071
How? Where's it
coming from?

110
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,306
                        There!

111
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,480
             Oh, no.

112
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,849
OK, which pony
broke protocol

113
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,620
and invited guests to
our training exercises?

114
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,822
                I guess they're
                   with me.

115
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,324
                Agh!

116
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:18,764
               Mom, Dad,
                 so ..good to see you.

117
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,101
        Oh, honey it's so
     great to see you, too!

118
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,570
And WOW! You were so
amazing up there

119
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,372
with all of that flying!

120
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,708
                Er.. How did you know
                   I was here?

121
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,844
Scootaloo filled us
in on everything.

122
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,013
You modest pony, you.

123
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,185
       I can't believe I'm
     documenting the moment

124
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,854
     your parents first saw
      you as a Wonderbolt!

125
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,827
          And these must be your
            Wonderbolt friends.

126
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,364
 Hello team! I'm Windy Whistles,

127
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:56,802
the mom of the best
Wonderbolt ever! Yeah!

128
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,639
Just kidding.. you guys
were great, too. Go team!

129
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,540
              Mom....

130
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,311
               Hello Ma'am, nice
                 to meet you.

131
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:11,850
Nice to meet you, as well and
love those goggles! Love 'em!

132
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,519
You know I have
goggles, too,

133
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,689
but they're mostly just for
swimming. Oh and bath time.

134
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:23,428
Mom, please! They don't want
to hear about your bath time.

135
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,166
I can't believe it. My
daughter, a Wonderbolt!

136
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,401
            So proud!

137
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,038
     Dad, hold it together!
        We're in public.

138
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,540
I know, I know, but it's just...

139
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,510
       you had a goal and
        ...you achieved it!

140
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,067
     All right Wonderbolts,
      let's hit the showers

141
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,656
   and give Rainbow Dash some
 time to spend with her family.

142
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,025
    OK, yeah. Great practice.

143
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,696
     I'll uh, catch up with
      you guys in a minute.

144
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,866
Sir. You really
raised a great flyer.

145
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:05,536
         Oh, no... tears
        welling up again!

146
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,738
              Dad.....

147
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,546
        Could you give us a sec?

148
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,149
Is something wrong?

149
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,084
        Yeah, you should
         have warned me

150
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,784
          that you were
      bringing my parents,

151
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,555
    or talked to Twilight or
  something. Not just shown up!

152
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,055
              Why?

153
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:28,927
   It's just, my parents and I
  have a delicate relationship.

154
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,196
      I love them very much
     and we're really close,

155
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,032
  but there's a reason I didn't
   tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!

156
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,002
      They can be a little
        bit... embarrassing.

157
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,205
          Huh...? Really?

158
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,074
          Yeah, really.

159
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,778
 And now you've invited a whole
   lot of crazy into my life!

160
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,713
        What's wrong with
        a little support?

161
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,054
Bow and Windy, I'd
like you to meet

162
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,522
Apple Bloom and
Sweetie Belle.

163
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,374
          Hi!

164
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,090
               Hello!

165
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,792
Greetings, small ponies.

166
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,194
Are you excited to
see Rainbow Dash?

167
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,264
          Oh, my, YES!

168
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,100
 And to think we never bothered
 to come to a Wonderbolt event!

169
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,303
     We said if Rainbow Dash
       isn't a Wonderbolt,

170
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,273
         then what's the
     point? But now she is!

171
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,241
       And she earned it!

172
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,211
       Did you know it all
   started when she won a spot

173
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,647
         in the coveted
       Wonderbolt Academy,

174
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,683
    training under Spitfire!

175
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,753
       I didn't know that!
         How wonderful!

176
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,790
      But then she had some
       heavy competition,

177
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:35,860
   especially against another
  Pegasus named Lightning Dust.

178
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,796
    Oh, no...

179
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,632
But of course, Rainbow
Dash proved to be the best

180
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,568
     and later made it into
    the Wonderbolt Reserves!

181
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,637
          Hooray again!

182
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:49,941
But.. a jealous ex-Wonderbolt,
Wind Rider, was worried

183
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,877
that Rainbow Dash might
break his speed record

184
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:57,048
and so he framed her for
a crime she didn't commit.

185
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,200
     Oh, no!

186
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,754
But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow
Dash proved her innocence

187
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,723
and became a back-up Wonderbolt.

188
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,825
    Until Fire Streak retired

189
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,294
        and she became an
      official Wonderbolt!

190
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,062
                  Hooray!

191
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,299
   Wow! What a gripping tale.

192
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,851
           You really know your
           Rainbow Dash history.

193
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,203
       You're going to do
      great on your report.

194
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,806
     Show's about to start!

195
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,349
    HOO! HOO! HOO! HOO! HOO!

196
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:35,053
           Come on, bolts, LET'S
             START THIS THING!

197
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:40,158
Wonderbolts Spring
Showcase HERE. WE. GOOOO!

198
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,828
   Rip it up and tear! it! down!

199
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,766
   Then build it back up again
  and tear it back down again!

200
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,000
              Yeah! Woo!

201
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,970
        Yeah! Uhuh! Uhuh!

202
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,606
          Go go go! Yes!

203
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,845
        GO RAINBOW DASH!
      BEST WONDERBOLT EVER!

204
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,582
Woohoo! That's my daughter!

205
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,651
      Go Rainbow! Go Dashie!
         Go go go go go!

206
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,492
      Woohoo! You go, girl!

207
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,997
Your folks were
definitely loud,

208
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,619
but they weren't that bad.

209
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,938
        Whoa, since when did we
      add fireworks to the show?

210
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,208
         Uh...we didn't.

211
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,945
       Atta girl! Woohoo!
   Yeah! Go girl! Go go go go!

212
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,385
      Wow.

213
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,460
        Go RAINBOW DASH!

214
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,498
      You sign that photo!

215
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,633
              Whoo!

216
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,473
     Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon!
     Cut the ribbon!

217
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,981
                The camera loves
                   you! Yeah!

218
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,384
    Now let's do the pyramid.

219
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,087
        Scootaloo get up
     there; you're the top!

220
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:21,159
You really do got yourself your
very own mega fans! Lucky you.

221
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,340
   You hung that towel!

222
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:35,641
YEAH!

223
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,576
Greatest towel
hanger OF ALL TIME!

224
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:45,650
          TOWEL! TOWEL!
          TOWEL! TOWEL!

225
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,050
              STOP!

226
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:51,923
This is ridiculous! Mom and Dad,
  you are both too supportive!

227
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,926
  This is exactly why I didn't
  tell you I was a Wonderbolt;

228
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,295
      you're just.. too much!

229
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,764
   Did.. did we do something wrong?

230
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,767
       Yes! The fireworks,
        the cheerleading

231
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,870
   and how do you even compare
     who is better or worse

232
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,839
     at hanging up a towel?!

233
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,209
        We're just trying
        to be supportive.

234
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,896
   Well, I'm tired of it! I've
      had enough of you two

235
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,120
     being so proud of every
       little ridiculous,

236
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,183
    insignificant thing I do!

237
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,755
    I think you should leave.

238
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,926
     First of all, great job
     yelling at us, sweetie.

239
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:33,164
  No one can make their parents
  feel more worthless than you.

240
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:38,370
Your words were direct,
clear and... so painful.

241
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,372
        Is there nothing
          you can't do!?

242
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,810
                   Why?

243
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,879
Scootaloo, you
don't understand.

244
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,149
    I met your parents hoping
     to learn more about you

245
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,451
        but I don't like
        what I found out.

246
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,723
     I'll find somepony else
    to do my hero report on.

247
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,537
        Scootaloo, wait!

248
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,005
I know I wasn't
myself back there

249
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,841
and I shouldn't have
snapped at my parents.

250
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,544
 But that's exactly why I didn't
   tell them I'm a Wonderbolt.

251
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,448
       I don't understand;
    they're so proud of you.

252
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,518
    Can I tell you something?

253
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,818
              Sure.

254
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,388
         OK, but you might want
         to hold onto your wings

255
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,425
         because this could rock
         you to your very core.

256
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,680
       Believe it or not,
        there was a time

257
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,333
        when I wasn't the
       best at everything.

258
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:48,239
   See this picture? It looks
  like I won something awesome.

259
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,042
        But, actually...

260
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,111
   Announcer: And last but not
  least, it's time to hand out

261
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,813
    our participant stickers.

262
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:05,924
       Yeah! Rainbow Dash,
         you show them!

263
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,961
   Greatest participant ever!

264
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:12,497
   Uh... your parents realize you
     didn't win, don't they?

265
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,169
Granted, I was the youngest pony

266
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,138
          in the senior
      competitive circuit.

267
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,806
    Most other ponies my age

268
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,142
        were still in the
      junior flappers club.

269
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,245
        I thought it was
       utterly mortifying

270
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,015
     having my parents cheer
     me on even when I lost.

271
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,218
     But then when I started
      to win competitions,

272
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,487
        which didn't take
     very long, by the way,

273
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,923
     things got even worse.

274
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,593
     Woo!! Yeah! Go Rainbow!
       Go Rainbow! Woohoo!

275
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,463
     Yeah, Rainbow Dash! You
    show em! That's our girl!

276
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,532
       Being the best came
       with consequences.

277
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,102
         Very loud, very
   embarrassing consequences.

278
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,973
You know, some
ponies would dream

279
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,575
of having parents
like that.

280
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,379
          Yeah, right, name one.

281
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:06,184
 Me. Growing up, I never thought
   I'd be the best at anything

282
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,287
  because no pony ever told me.

283
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:12,257
    But your parents told you
  over and over again -- look.

284
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:17,462
   Best bath taker ever. Best
    carrot eater under three.

285
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,532
  Greatest napper of all time!

286
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,036
  I am pretty good at napping.
   I can fall asleep anywhere.

287
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:29,574
              Huh?

288
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,411
For your entire life,
your parents gave you

289
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,446
the confidence to
believe in yourself.

290
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,688
   You're right. I was always
  so embarrassed by my parents

291
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,657
   that I didn't realize their
    support actually made me

292
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,727
     the awesome, confident,
        amazing, awesome

293
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,762
     and awesome pony I am!

294
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,069
  And I took them for granted!

295
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,537
And you yelled
   at them.

296
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,206
        Ugh, I gotta make
           this right.

297
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,745
     I have an idea, but I'm
    going to need your help!

298
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,348
  That is, if you're willing to
help me after I acted like that.

299
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,552
   Now that's a great picture.

300
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,322
Rainbow Dash learns
the error of her ways.

301
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,794
     I'm telling you, I just
       can't see a thing!

302
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,930
     Scootaloo, you are just
     so great at blindfolds.

303
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,034
   It's true. You must tell me
   what kind of knot you used.

304
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,237
     A Falconer's knot? Wait
     no... a farmer's loop!

305
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,773
           What's this
       all about, anyhoo?

306
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,876
 Rainbow over loudspeaker: Windy
    Whistles and Bow Hothoof,

307
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,547
  please be seated for a super
    private Wonderbolt event.

308
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,458
              Ahem.

309
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,460
   Mom and Dad, welcome to the...

310
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,660
     "I love my parents and
   I'm sorry that I took them

311
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:59,864
   for granted and I know that
   they made me who I am today

312
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,899
    so I really want to make
      it up to them" event.

313
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:05,870
             Enjoy.

314
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,143
Thanks for doing this.

315
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,411
                  Happy to help!

316
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,753
         Ooooh! Aaaaah!

317
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,101
Oooooh!

318
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:36,221
Oooooh!

319
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,807
 Mom and Dad, I want you to know
   that I'm your biggest fan.

320
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:49,981
  Oh, honey, thank you. But you
   didn't have to do all this.

321
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,151
  It's kind of... embarrassing.

322
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,520
Yeah, it is a bit much.

323
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,290
   And that's why Rainbow Dash

324
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,293
    is the most inspirational
        pony in my life.

325
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,632
      Thank you, Scootaloo.
      Very well researched,

326
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,734
       but a little heavy
         on the pictures

327
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,471
      and there was a moldy
    sandwich in your report.

328
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,405
       I'll give you a B.

329
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,677
YEAH! GREATEST
REPORT-GIVER OF ALL TIME!

330
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,415
   SCOOT-AL-LOO! SCOOT-AL-LOO!
          SCOOT-AL-LOO!

331
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,919
  Keep it down! OK, this isn't
    a rock and roll concert!

332
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,721
                      Please!

333
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,045
   SCOOT-AL-LOO! SCOOT-AL-LOO!
          SCOOT-AL-LOO!
