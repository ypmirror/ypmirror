1
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:37,069
    Ahem. Morning, Sunburst.

2
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,171
                   What? Oh. Hi!

3
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:39,985
                    Heh heh.

4
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:42,398
     You know, no matter how
      many times I read it,

5
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:45,411
  Houyhnhnm's Guide to Magical
    Arcana never gets boring.

6
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,013
If you say so.

7
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:52,151
   I've got another letter
   for you from Sires Hollow.

8
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,852
             Mm-hmm. Sure thing.

9
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,401
          What's this?

10
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,572
   Could I be experiencing the

11
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,807
 Cerebration Transmogrification
 Effect described in Chapter 17?

12
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,579
  Oh, my cutie mark is glowing.

13
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,349
    My cutie mark is glowing!

14
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,150
     I know what this means!

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,686
        Why am I yelling!?

16
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:11,263
Princess Twilight,
what an honor this is.

17
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,265
I mean, it is, right?

18
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,767
        I'm called for a
       friendship mission?

19
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,218
                You sure are.

20
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,831
                  And it must be
                  a special one.

21
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,144
     Nopony outside of Ponyville
    has ever been called before.

22
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,746
If you need some
pointers, let me know.

23
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,848
I've been on my fair
share of missions.

24
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,218
                  You've been on
                  one, Spike.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,687
          And that's.. my
           fair share.

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,576
    Starlight!

27
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,193
You mean we've
both been called?

28
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,295
This is great!

29
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,864
              [unexcited]
              Yeah. Great.

30
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,533
Aren't you excited?

31
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,335
              You and me!
             On a mission!

32
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,470
                Together.

33
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:56,375
I-I'm sorry, are you not excited
 to go on a mission with me?

34
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,476
     No...

35
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,745
No! I mean, yes. Heh.

36
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,713
Totally excited about
us going together,

37
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,617
just not so excited
about where.

38
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,421
             Sires Hollow?

39
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,490
 Yep. Home.

40
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,525
           Oh. Great.

41
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,998
    You know, I can go if
     you two don't want to.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,933
     I am kind of an expert.

43
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,349
      It's not that I don't
       want to go home,

44
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,887
  it's just that whenever I do,
 my dad treats me like a filly,

45
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:45,023
     like nothing's changed
       since I was a foal.

46
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,024
      Huh.

47
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,059
                     I know. I'm a horrible
                     daughter.

48
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,929
     No, no.

49
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,264
My mom actually does
kind of the same thing.

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,083
             Really?

51
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:55,867
I don't even have to go home.

52
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,536
She sends me
letters constantly

53
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,571
asking about my plans
for the future.

54
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,008
<i>"You're a grown-up pony,</i>
<i>Sunburst. You need a plan."</i>

55
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,677
I haven't been home
in a while either.

56
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,481
     Hm. We'll just have to
     explain to our parents

57
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,350
   that we're on an important
     friendship mission,

58
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:12,884
        so they can't bother us.

59
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,353
Do you think
that will work?

60
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:15,354
              Nope!

61
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,766
        [sigh] The great
       thing about home is

62
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,035
       it always stays
       just how you left--

63
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:30,970
           [bang] OH!

64
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,708
       Where did that come from?

65
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,011
  [woman's voice over speaker]
   Welcome to Sires Hollow.

66
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,517
  Essence?

67
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,886
        Essence of what?

68
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,221
 You tell me.

69
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,092
                     What is it?

70
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,827
Ah. Chocolate? Maybe?

71
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,729
      Not chocolate maybe.

72
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,498
      Chocolate definitely.

73
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,868
   And all of the benefits
   with none of the drawbacks.

74
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,872
             Didn't this used to
              be a fruit stand?

75
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,107
I don't know what
it used to be.

76
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,444
The Sires Hollow Development
Committee determined what it is.

77
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,347
               The Sires Hollow
               Development what?

78
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,082
      Where do ponies buy fruit?

79
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,118
You can get a fruit
smoothie two doors down.

80
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,656
  All the shops are different.

81
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,091
      Everything's changed!

82
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,794
         Not everything.

83
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,862
 That's the same as it ever was.

84
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,275
Sorry, our bookstore's
been declared a

85
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,777
"site of historical
significance"

86
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,114
by the Sires Hollow
Preservation Society.

87
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,617
    You'll have to experience
      the books from here.

88
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,688
       That's why windows
        are see-through.

89
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,324
                  WHAT?

90
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,460
      Preservation Society?

91
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,094
 What is happening around here?

92
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,330
              I'll explain it to
              you, Sugar-Plum.

93
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,269
            You are just as
         cutsie-wootsie as ever!

94
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,471
   Dad!

95
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:13,972
   Quit it!

96
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,275
What is going on?

97
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:19,277
  Oh! Just a father wanting to
preserve our town's rich history

98
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,646
                 for his little
                Pumpkie-Wumpkin.

99
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,683
    Dad. You promised no
   pumpkie-wumpkins in public.

100
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,653
  [whispers]
Sorry, Chipmunk Cheeks.

101
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,691
       Er. Don't.

102
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,259
You're preserving
 the whole town?

103
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,311
That's crazy.

104
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:37,262
                That's exactly
               what I told him.

105
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,932
       I said, "Firelight,
         you're crazy."

106
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:42,886
    Mom?

107
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,704
      Our village needs the
    same thing you do, Sunburst:

108
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,672
                 a clear plan
                 for the future.

109
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,010
 That's why I started the Sires
  Hollow Development Committee.

110
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,613
     And I've got plans
      for this little town.

111
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,281
           Big plans.

112
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,834
 Listen here, Stellar Flare; I'm
   not going to let you

113
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,856
  turn our historical heritage
    into Las Pegasus!

114
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,628
And I'm not going to let
you turn it into a museum!

115
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,431
              Wait.

116
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,799
 Are you two fighting over this?

117
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,434
Like, having a
friendship problem?

118
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,703
Oh, there's no problem.

119
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,606
                Because there is
                 no friendship.

120
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,810
Well, the good news is
we know why we're here.

121
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,122
      Maybe we should have
      sent Spike after all.

122
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,766
     Sunburst and I were
     called here to do a job

123
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,368
        and it looks like
         you two are it.

124
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,606
           You mean your success
              depends on us?

125
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,125
                Uh...

126
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,743
And you have to hang out with
us the whole time you're here?

127
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,347
          Um...

128
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,549
            Well, I'll hear what
              you have to say,

129
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,251
             but every plan I've
             made for this town

130
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,819
        is perfectly reasonable.

131
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,854
Good luck convincing me
my preservation efforts

132
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,855
don't make sense.

Welcome to Sires Hollow.

134
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,337
     So we can't hold the books?

00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,239
Ha ha ha ha ha ha. No.

00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,445
     Too bad there's nowhere
      to get actual fruit.

144
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,082
In the future, all ponies
will drink their fruit.

145
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,023
       One hundred percent
      ancient pony grains.

146
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,359
Just like the town
founders ate.

147
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,162
Hope you like crust!

148
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,069
     [squeak]
    Welcome to Sires Hollow.

149
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,388
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

150
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,590
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

151
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,942
Welcome to Sires Hollow.

152
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,229
          Welcome to Sires--

153
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,747
  OK, it's annoying. I get it.

154
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:49,087
  Maybe my preservation efforts
   were a little over the top.

155
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,056
Oh...
Oh no.

156
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,359
      And I might have been
     trying to turn the town

157
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,794
      into a shopping mall.

158
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,030
Well, whatever direction
the town takes, from now on

159
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,132
how about we work
together on it?

160
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,268
                  Deal!

161
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,337
Sunburst, you should
move closer to Ponyville.

162
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,207
After this success, I'm sure
the Princess of Friendship

163
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,009
will want to send you
on more missions.

164
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,779
               That's not really
                 how it works.

165
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,548
      Oh, look at the time!

166
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,283
      We should get going,
      now that we've solved

167
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:21,019
     the friendship problem!
        Right, Starlight?

168
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,823
   Yeah. The thing is, I don't
     think we did solve it.

169
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,391
         When we solve a
       friendship problem,

170
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,493
       our cutie marks are
        supposed to glow.

171
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,196
Aww, don't be
disappointed, Puddin'.

172
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,865
Your papa will work
this out for ya.

173
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:39,638
  [sigh] My papa wasn't called by the
map in Twilight's castle; I was.

174
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,545
How are you going to explain
this to the princess?

175
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,414
What's your plan if she fires
you from friendship quests?

176
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:50,927
              Mom!

177
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:51,872
         She doesn't...

178
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:52,917
           It's not...

179
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,053
Use your words, Sunburst.

180
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,556
 I guess you two
weren't the problem

181
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,525
we were sent to
solve, after all.

182
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,395
      So now you don't even
      know why you're here?

183
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,698
We have to figure this out
before we run out of time!

184
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,201
            [sigh] Mom. There
             isn't a time limit.

185
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,904
So you're here for
an extra-long visit?

186
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,273
You can stay in your
old room, Punkie-Wunk.

187
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,109
It's just like you left it!

188
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,717
[softly] We need to find this
friendship problem... now!

189
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,187
Now, I know you have
your little job to do,

190
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,690
but Stellar and I know the
town a lot better than you two.

191
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,009
                   That's right.

192
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,427
             Neither of you have
             been home in ages.

193
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,563
            You're going to need
            our help to succeed.

194
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,501
          I guess that
          makes sense...

195
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:45,536
                  I already have
                    some ideas.

196
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,771
Me too!

197
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,608
    I think I liked it better
    when they were fighting.

198
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,282
               OK.

199
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,218
   Now that I've explained how
    Sires Hollow was founded,

200
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,721
 we can start to explore all the
  possible friendship problems

201
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,190
      that might have
      developed over time.

202
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,695
            I appreciate the
            history lesson, Dad,

203
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,231
              but I need to find
              the problem now...

204
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,365
                 in the present.

205
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,502
Aw, now Hon-Bun, how
are you gonna do that

206
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,004
without all the
backstory, huh?

207
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,309
Oh, of course I know
how hard it is for you

208
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,111
to sit still and focus, so...

209
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,715
Would it help you pay attention
to hold on to your bwankie?

210
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,224
     Now you've had a little
    setback, but don't worry.

211
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,259
       I know exactly what
         you need to do.

212
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,593
Make a plan?

213
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,096
                Already got one.

214
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,098
       Step one: interview
          the suspects.

215
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,068
   Step two: use your talents
     to solve the issue.

216
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,370
     Step three: get the
     Princess of Friendship

217
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,339
         to send you on
         more missions!

218
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,743
Mom! IT DOES NOT
 WORK LIKE THAT.

219
00:12:58,845 --> 00:12:59,744
                         Uh-huh!

220
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,850
                      AHEM.

221
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,189
[acting]
Oh, thank goodness you are here.

222
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,126
   These two ponies refuse
     to use my essences.

223
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,131
   Maybe because we don't like
   to cover our natural scent.

224
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:21,900
                    AHEM!

225
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:31,776
              And <i>she</i> refuses
               to buy our books.

226
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,180
[all together]
Surely this is a
  friendship problem.

227
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,386
It needs to be a real
friendship problem!

228
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,954
You can't just make one up!

229
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:43,988
URGH!

230
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,226
      This is what happens
     when we don't rehearse!

231
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,127
              UGH.

232
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,031
           Starlight?

233
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,299
            Sweetie?

234
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:59,069
   I found a really old town
  bylaw that nopony agrees on.

235
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,506
      Apparently, we're not
       supposed to prance

236
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,074
   or canter after dinnertime.

237
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,710
   Could that be the problem?
       Sillyfilly?

238
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
              Phew.

239
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,683
             What are you doing?

240
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,785
[sigh] Hiding from my mother.

241
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,921
She started making up friendship
problems for me to solve.

242
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,124
           Oh.. My dad won't even let
            me talk to anypony,

243
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:24,129
  in case they're "strangers."
   I'm A GROWN MARE!

244
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,498
We're never going to find
the friendship problem

245
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,335
with them around,
let alone solve it.

246
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,605
Maybe you two should start
looking for it on your own?

247
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,515
 OK, so we wanted to talk to all
  of you, you know, in private.

248
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,752
       Just to see if there were
       issues any of you had

249
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,787
              with your friends.

250
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:50,288
             Got it.

251
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,390
       Just one question.

252
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,258
     Why are we whispering?

253
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,529
 They're avoiding their parents.

254
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,764
   Ohhh!

255
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,334
               No. Not avoiding.

256
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,103
            Just.. taking a break.

257
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,039
              Yeah...

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,874
  We needed to focus, but we're
  definitely not avoiding them.

259
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,145
      So you're whispering
       with all of us

260
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,947
      in the darkest corner
        of the shop,

261
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,016
        where nopony can
          possibly see

262
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,284
         because you're
       <i>not</i> avoiding them?

263
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,187
                  Mm-hmm!

264
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,956
    Er.. but they definitely can't
     hear us in here, right?

265
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,291
     No way!

266
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,125
 This is the
antiquities section.

267
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,495
Nopony ever comes
   back here.

268
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,931
            Firelight: There you are!

269
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,666
But what are you doing in here?

270
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,336
        [gasp] Is the
       friendship problem

271
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,771
     in my favorite section
      of the book store?

272
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,612
...and then I
thought the best way

273
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,114
    to look for a friendship
    problem in the present...

274
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,167
   Dad!

275
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:55,319
      ...was to look back in our
      town history even farther!

276
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,156
        Stellar Flare: Sunburst!

277
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,825
                   Oh. Finally.

278
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,193
   Now, I know you don't want
   me to "make up" a problem,

279
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,063
    but what if I START one?

280
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,399
That's not how this...

281
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,067
   I mean, no pony ever became
     a success by following

282
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,736
      all the rules, right?

283
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,637
                  How are things
                   on your end?

284
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,139
             Couldn't be better.

285
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,807
             New leads and such!

286
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:17,977
              Guys?

287
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,346
 We really are providing
excellent assistance, aren't we?

288
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,332
              Guys!

289
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:26,217
 I dare say our children should
   be grateful for our help.

290
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,485
              GUYS!

291
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,321
  Both: We don't WANT your HELP!

292
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,033
        I'm sorry, you
      don't want our help?

293
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,635
          [laugh] That's--that's
             ridiculous.

294
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,772
     What reason could you
     possibly have for that?

295
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,442
BECAUSE YOU'RE DRIVING US CRAZY!

296
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,577
           Oh, really?

297
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,046
       And just how am I
       driving you crazy?

298
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,882
 By always coming up with plans!

299
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,051
I don't need a plan!

300
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:04,756
I mean, maybe I do, but
it'll be mine, not yours!

301
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,260
        Well, I'm sorry
       for trying to help!

302
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,098
   And you're not any better.

303
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,167
        I'm not a filly.

304
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,571
 I'm a grown pony with a job to
  do and I'll do it on my own.

305
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,742
       Well, I'll let you
        get to it, then.

306
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,614
                  Great...

307
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,849
  Now we have to smooth things
    over with our parents

308
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,784
  on top of finding and solving
   a friendship problem.

309
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,255
It's almost like our
relationship with our parents

310
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,957
is the friendship problem.

311
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,025
              You don't think
              that's it, do you?

312
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,227
Ahem.

313
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,062
That's what all
of us think.

314
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,464
                       Agh!

315
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:51,935
 Why couldn't we have been sent
   to stop a war or something?

316
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,044
                          Dad?

317
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,146
Hello, Ms. Glimmer.

318
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,148
How is your friendship
problem search going?

319
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,350
       I only ask as an
      interested observer,

320
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,486
     since I know you are an
       adult who's capable

321
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,522
     of doing things without
     help from anypony else.

322
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:17,262
  Actually, I think Sunburst
  and I figured out what it is.

323
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,632
    So, Stellar and I weren't
    really helpful after all.

324
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,835
              Well, we haven't
             actually solved it.

325
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,637
       And I don't think we can.

326
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,272
                Not without you.

327
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:37,917
            Pungent!

328
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,153
       Oh, did you come by
       to be driven crazy

329
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,589
 by more of your mother's plans?

330
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,125
    No, I came to apologize.

331
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,895
    Well, it's going to take
    more than an apology

332
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,397
    to make up for telling me
     you don't want my help

333
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,266
finding your friendship problem.

334
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,235
   Oh, I'm not sorry for that.

335
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,303
 Starlight and I already figured
    out what the problem is.

336
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,772
   This is a terrible apology.

337
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,543
     Well, if you come with
       me and help fix it,

338
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,011
   I'll give you a better one.

339
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,583
  Usually, Twilight or one of
  our other friends gets called

340
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,519
     to a place with a
   friendship problem to fix.

341
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,722
       But Starlight and I
      realized we came here

342
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,591
     to fix a friendship
     problem we already had.

343
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,661
       I'm sorry I've been
   avoiding coming home, Dad,

344
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,565
     but you can't keep
    treating me like a foal.

345
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,300
      I'm sorry, Sugarbun!

346
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,273
 I just know how hard things
were for you when you left home.

347
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:40,245
 I guess I wanted you to feel
 safe, like when you were young.

348
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,780
              Dad, I know I've
             made some mistakes,

349
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,715
               and I'll probably
              make a bunch more,

350
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,551
          but I learn from them.

351
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,786
               I think that's
             what growing up is.

352
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:54,558
I'm sorry I never told you how
much your plans bothered me,

353
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,561
and I know you just
want me to succeed,

354
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,863
but I need to do
that on my own.

355
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,998
         I remember how
          lost you were

356
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,534
      when you flunked out
        of magic school.

357
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,003
       I thought as long
       as you had a plan,

358
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,639
        you'd never feel
         that way again.

359
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,774
  You don't have to worry, Mom.

360
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,609
   I need to find my own way,

361
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,245
     but I definitely don't
       feel lost anymore.

362
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,860
       It's so beautiful!

363
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:34,665
 The glowing cutie mark is such
   a symbol of accomplishment.

364
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,534
I don't suppose
there's a way for you

365
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,469
 to get it to glow all the time.

366
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,906
     Heh heh. Pretty sure it
     doesn't work that way.

367
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,008
   Not unless we solved a
  friendship problem every few

368
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,246
 seconds, and I kinda hope this
   one will be it for a while.

369
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,916
  You know, it seems to me your
  map is saying we're not just

370
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:55,754
       your parents; we're
        your friends too.

371
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,689
           I guess so.

372
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:01,425
  So, if I promise to treat you
    less like a little filly

373
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,228
     and more like a friend,
      will you visit more?

374
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,397
           Absolutely.

375
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,369
      And if you start to
      drive me crazy again,

376
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,871
      I'll tell you instead
      of never coming home.

377
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,041
     That's lovely of you to
    say, dear, but you know,

378
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,777
     I can always visit you.

379
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,211
    Stellar, you're a genius!

380
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,347
            Ha ha ha!

381
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,282
              How do you feel
              about a road trip?

382
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,918
I might have a few
plans for that.
