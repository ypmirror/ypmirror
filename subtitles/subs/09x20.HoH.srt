     but everypony has
    something to contribute.

415
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,781
       The trick is
       figuring out what.

416
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,650
  What if you and your
  friend can't figure it out?

417
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,753
If you have a job to do, you
have to decide what's best

418
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,989
and be upfront and honest,
even if that means

419
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,124
you can't work with
a friend on it.

420
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:17,595
 So, I guess that means talking
 to them at the beginning

421
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:21,199
instead of stringing them along
until you get so frustrated

422
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,635
 you totally lose it and say a
 bunch of really awful things?

423
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:25,870
Pretty much.

424
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,004
                  [groan]

425
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,208
         [knock knock]

426
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,676
      Trixie?

427
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,444
I know you're in there.

428
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,346
      Well, you're wrong!

429
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,370
[clinking] [coughing]

430
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,952
       I'm sorry for all
      those things I said.

431
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,388
      I just really wanted
       it to work out,

432
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,124
     even though I knew
     it probably wouldn't.

433
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,259
       I should have said
       something sooner.

434
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,628
      Obviously, we can't
       have what we want

435
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,097
      because I'm TERRIBLE
       at everything

436
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,099
      and could never
    help you with anything.

437
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,901
            You aren't terrible.

438
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,037
      And you have a lot
      of great qualities.

439
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,806
    Maybe not Vice-Headmare
      qualities,

440
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:05,175
     but great and powerful
       friend qualities...

441
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:07,599
          [door opens]

442
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,249
Well, you really stand by
the ponies you care about.

443
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,252
Gallus even said no creatures
EVER stuck up for him

444
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,187
the way you did
with Grandpa Gruff.

445
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,158
It would have been nice to
run the school together,

446
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,862
but not everypony is
right for every job.

447
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,299
   I know how you take your
  responsibilities seriously.

448
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,237
 And maybe I should have known
I wasn't exactly a perfect fit.

449
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,407
If it makes you feel
any better, nopony was.

450
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,408
               What do you mean?

451
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,079
Well, Dr. Hooves has decided to
go back to his experiments

452
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,347
and Octavia is worried the
responsibilities of

453
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,451
Vice-Headmare will take too
much time away from her music.

454
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,854
Maybe getting a Vice-Headmare
  was a bad idea..

455
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:50,789
                     Starlight.

456
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:53,824
Obviously, you'd like some help,
and hiring a Vice-Headmare

457
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,326
                IS a great idea.

458
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,262
But.. who could it be?

459
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:01,465
     Well, you need somepony
     who's responsible like you,

460
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,135
            and detail-oriented,
            like Twilight.

461
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:08,539
        And smart, obviously, it
        is a school after all.

462
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,808
It would be nice if I
got along with them,

463
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,278
since having it be a
friend can't work out.

464
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,312
                 Maybe it can!

465
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,648
          [explosion]

466
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,118
    ...and I knew as soon as
     I read Trixie's scroll

467
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,554
  that it was the exact right
  thing for me to do.

468
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,324
   But what about being
   Flurry Heart's Crystaler?

469
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,060
 Well, honestly, now that
 Flurry Heart's a little older,

470
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,695
there really isn't
much for me to do

471
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,131
outside of the occasional
tradition or festival.

472
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,000
And working at a school is what
I always thought I'd do,

473
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,135
I mean, if you'll have me..

474
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,603
                Are you kidding!?

475
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,705
                   You're hired!

476
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,607
            I had a feeling
            this would work out.

477
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,943
       Oh, Trixie, thank
       you so much!

478
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,445
    Between being insightful
     when I want to be

479
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,615
          and giving good advice
           when I don't mean to,

480
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,117
            I suppose I can be a
            pretty good friend.

481
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,053
More than that, actually.

482
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,155
       You really did
       give good advice,

483
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,923
     and you helped me talk
      through the problem

484
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,891
      of finding the right
       pony for the job.

485
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,094
      And we know you care
      about the students..

486
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:06,330
          Trixie the Great and
          Powerful Advice Giver,

487
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,534
       Problem Talk Througher,
       and Student Care Abouter!

488
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,702
                 Eh. I think I'll go
                 with friend.

489
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,040
Friend is perfect, but.. there's a
position here at the school

490
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,109
you might be
right for too..

491
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,544
What would you say to being
the School of Friendship's

492
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,646
NEW student counselor?

493
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,585
   I'd say, this office needs
   a bit of redecorating!

494
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,254
               Potted plants
             scream desperation..

495
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,656
          Phyllis! No!
