1
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:06,064
Hey Spike. What's up?

2
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:08,300
Just, uh, wanted to
make sure you're ready

3
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,464
for your big
ceremony today.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,656
Yup. Wow, I still can't
believe my friends and I

5
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:15,636
are getting medals of honor.

6
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:19,344
Are you kidding? You
totally deserve it!

7
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:25,348
After all, you saved Equestria
from Queen Chrysalis

8
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:29,336
with the help of Trixie
and Thorax and Discord.

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:33,288
Uh, yeah. I know what
happened. I was kinda there?

10
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:37,556
Oh, right. Uh, so
what are you wearing?

11
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,736
Not sure. Why? Am I
supposed to dress up?

12
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:45,676
No. I mean, you could. It's
like Rarity always says:

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,352
"There's no such thing
as overdressed darling.

14
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:51,908
You're just the best-looking
pony in the room!"

15
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:56,356
What are you
looking at?

16
00:00:56,668 --> 00:00:57,572
No, don't look!

17
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:04,468
Cuz there was a spider there
but it's gone now so...

18
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:05,724
Thanks, Starlight!
Bye!

19
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:15,996
Heh heh. She had no idea.
We're a good team, Sparkle.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,408
Sparkle? Yeah we are.
So, do you think she'll like it?

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,216
I want this present to
say "I'm so proud of you,

22
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:27,540
both as a mentor
and a friend.

23
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:30,476
Equestria is safer
thanks to you."

24
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:34,104
Oh. I thought you were getting
her a mirror, like yours.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,008
I am.

26
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:37,868
Maybe you should
get her a card,

27
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:39,944
cause I don't think the
mirror will say all that.

28
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,336
But I think
she'll like it.

29
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,260
It's just what
her room needs.

30
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:45,816
The first thing she'll see
when she wakes up is herself

31
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,416
surrounded by all her friends!

32
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:49,900
I plan on giving it to
her after the ceremony.

33
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,424
Yeah, about that.

34
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,868
Don't you need to get the castle
ready for the celebration?

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,436
Nah. Pinkie Pie's
got that covered.

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,132
Hm.

37
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:13,360

By YayPonies
Hey look! it's NEW PONY SEASON TIME!
https://yp1.yayponies.eu

38
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,492
Starlight, Trixie,
Thorax and Discord

39
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:46,444
were brave in the
face of danger,

40
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:48,832
resourceful when
things got challenging

41
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,964
and proved that the
bonds of friendship,

42
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:54,916
no matter how unlikely, are
stronger than any adversity.

43
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:57,140
By stopping
Queen Chrysalis,

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,464
not only did they
save Equestria,

45
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:02,192
they set the changelings
free from her reign.

46
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:06,912
Go Discord! Yahoo!

47
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:12,440
And that's why we're proud
and honored to give them

48
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:15,584
the Equestrian Pink
Hearts of Courage.

49
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:33,192
Yeah! Oh! Not quite!

50
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,716
All right! There it is.
YAAAAAAY!

51
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:43,328
We are so proud of you all.

52
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:59,460
It was the Great and
Powerful Trixie's pleasure

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,296
to save you from
your imminent doom.

54
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:06,324
Yes. Because you did
it all by yourself.

55
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:09,888
I can't believe you managed
to do it without magic.

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,508
It was amazing!

57
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,168
No one's ever stood up
to Chrysalis like that.

58
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:18,684
Oh, I just did what
anypony would've done.

59
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:20,996
It's a wonderful
feeling, isn't it?

60
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,624
Watching your
student shine

61
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,796
the way you always
knew they could.

62
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,436
My cheeks are sore.

63
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:30,336
I don't think I've ever
smiled this much in my life.

64
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:33,440
I can only imagine
what that feels like.

65
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:39,264
Yes, Starlight is student
of the year, isn't she?

66
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
She has so much
potential.

67
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:43,120
So, what are we going
to do with her?

68
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:46,028
And by "we" I
definitely mean you.

69
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,924
Being her mentor
and all that,

70
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:51,528
her destiny falls
squarely on your haunches.

71
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:54,496
Oh, don't you worry.

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,400
I've planned enough
friendship lessons

73
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:58,132
to cover the next
three years.

74
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:01,672
What's so funny?

75
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,212
No, no.

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,492
Clearly Starlight is beyond
basic friendship lessons.

77
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,768
She just won a medal,
for Equestria's sake!

78
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:14,116
I thought you were joking.
You are joking, right?

79
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,884
Of course I was.

80
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:20,796
Obviously you should have a
grand master plan for her,

81
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:24,260
the same way Celestia
set you on a path

82
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,728
that eventually
made you a princess.

83
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:28,780
Yup.

84
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:35,560
Oh, good. I'm sure she can't
wait to hear all about it!

85
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,352
So how's the whole
ruling-a-kingdom thing going?

86
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:45,068
It's a bit... overwhelming.
But we're adjusting.

87
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:48,964
So you can't have friendship
without makeovers?

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,324
Not exactly.

89
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,344
Oh, Starlight!

90
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:57,176
Princess Twilight has something
very important to tell us.

91
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:01,444
Well, just you really, but
I'm nosey and I want to hear.

92
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:04,280
OK. Would you
excuse me?

93
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:06,976
Never mind.

94
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,396
What's going on?

95
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:11,144
Well, Twilight was
just about to reveal

96
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,996
her grand master
plan for you.

97
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,152
Really? I was kind
of wondering

98
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,372
what we were going
to do next.

99
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,728
Yes, I'd say we were
both fairly interested.

100
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:26,304
Of course you are. And I
do have a plan, obviously,

101
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:28,540
but now's clearly not
the time to do it.

102
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,960
You should enjoy your party.

103
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,004
Starlight, come on!

104
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:34,216
The Ponyville Chronicle
wants to take our picture!

105
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,228
Ugh. You too,
Discord.

106
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,012
PSST. I see what you're doing.

107
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:44,092
You do?

108
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:47,464
You already planned
the perfect moment

109
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:50,044
during the party to make
the grand announcement

110
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,624
to everypony
about your plan!

111
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,280
Brava, Twilight.

112
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:57,640
I can't wait to tell
Fluttershy and the others!

113
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,120
Discord, no.

114
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:07,104
Twilight? Are you reading
during a party again?

115
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,640
No, no, no. She's
already good at that.

116
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,932
She mastered this. She
taught me about this one!

117
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:15,352
Wild guess: something's wrong.

118
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,732
Spike, I'm a terrible mentor.

119
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,200
Why didn't I come up with
a path for Starlight?

120
00:07:20,412 --> 00:07:22,936
Princess Celestia had it
all figured out for me.

121
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,784
That's it!

122
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,260
I had years' worth
of friendship lessons

123
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:31,052
ready to go,

124
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,044
but when we were
captured by Chrysalis,

125
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,452
Starlight took charge
and really stepped up.

126
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:37,184
I don't think
friendship lessons

127
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:38,732
are enough for
her anymore.

128
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:43,076
So you have an overachieving
student? Sounds familiar.

129
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,992
That's why I had
to talk to you.

130
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:48,208
You of all ponies
would know what to do.

131
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:50,784
I mean, you were me
and I was Starlight.

132
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:53,608
But for now, I need you to
pretend you're you and I'm me.

133
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:54,456
Huh?

134
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:55,992
Go on.

135
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,560
When I was your student
and you were in this place,

136
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:02,812
you... oh no. You
sent me to Ponyville.

137
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:04,444
Which means, it's
time for me

138
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,228
to send Starlight
Glimmer away!

139
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:11,424
I can't believe it.

140
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,656
It really is time for
Starlight to go, isn't it?

141
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,456
Only you can make
that decision.

142
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,088
It's a difficult one, but your
heart knows what's right.

143
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:22,984
Even as it hurts.

144
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,624
Where are you going
to send her?

145
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:27,376
Too soon?

146
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,944
No. This is something
I have to do.

147
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:35,436
Oh, boy.

148
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:36,948
Oh, boy?

149
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:39,312
Whatever Twilight's
planning for Starlight

150
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,560
is going to be
so exciting!

151
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:44,864
Hm. Wonder why she didn't
tell any of us about it?

152
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:48,056
Probably because you're not as
close as you think you are.

153
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:53,500
Just kidding. She wanted
it to be a big surprise.

154
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,808
Just between us,
she's getting ready

155
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:58,052
to make a big
announcement!

156
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,760
Eeeee. That's so
exciting! And surprising.

157
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,180
Usually you tell
your party planner

158
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:03,764
about all your plans
for your party.

159
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,508
Well, she definitely has one.

160
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,680
I mean when has
Twilight not had a plan?

161
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,700
Hm, gosh, I don't know.

162
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,744
I GOT IT!
Since defeating Chrysalis,

163
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:19,064
Starlight's given
the changelings

164
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:21,488
an opportunity to
revolutionize their society.

165
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,152
Maybe I can send her there.

166
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:30,956
Cool spell.

167
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,272
If Starlight goes to
the changeling hive,

168
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:35,628
she can help them adjust
to their new way of life.

169
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:38,164
OK, friendship one-oh-one:

170
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,332
Thorax and I are going to
show you how to compromise.

171
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,112
I want to have honeysuckle
nectar for lunch.

172
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:49,544
I would like a sandwich.
Oh, no. What should we do?

173
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:52,860
Attack! The winner
gets to choose!

174
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,872
OR, Thorax and I can
talk about it and come up

175
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,772
with a solution that
works for everypony.

176
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:04,936
Starlight. How do
you feel about

177
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:08,056
honeysuckle and peanut
butter sandwiches?

178
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,284
Why, that sounds
delicious.

179
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,444
Compromise!

180
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,776
Um, this doesn't
seem like something

181
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,368
Starlight and
Thorax would do.

182
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,980
Uh, this is Twilight's
fantasy, Spike.

183
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:26,384
There is no wrong
way to fantasize.

184
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:27,488
Thank you.

185
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:31,712
Starlight Glimmer is a most
apt and perspicacious pony!

186
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:34,452
Yep, definitely a
Twilight fantasy.

187
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,902
This seems like a lovely
path for Starlight.

188
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:39,728
The Changelings have
so much to learn

189
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:42,368
about how to enjoy love
through friendships.

190
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,232
Starlight would be busy
for a very long time,

191
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,808
but her work there
would be very rewarding.

192
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,116
Or dangerous. It would
only take one Changeling

193
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,540
to deviate from the pack.

194
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:07,684
Hi, I'm Starlight Glimmer.
What's your name?

195
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:09,524
Uh, Cornicle?

196
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,404
PFFFT! HA! What kind
of name is that?

197
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:19,364
Your wings are so
um, see-through.

198
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,384
I'm so glad I'm a pony.
Are you like bugs or what?

199
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,820
There she is! Get her!

200
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,596
Um, that probably
won't happen.

201
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:42,516
But it could. I can't
just send her off to

202
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,892
Celestia-knows-where without
thinking it through!

203
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,939
Huh. I was not aware
that I was an expression.

204
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,856
An appropriate one, of course,

205
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,964
for even I don't
know the answer.

206
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:54,340
This is a momentous
decision.

207
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,924
You must consider all
the possibilities.

208
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:58,788
Rethink, rethink, rethink...

209
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,884
What about the dragons?

210
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,076
I can send Starlight
to the Dragon Lands.

211
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,072
She and Ember would
totally hit it off!

212
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:12,936
Emberrrr!

213
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,008
Starliiiiight!

214
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,820
You ready to do some
death-defying dragon stuff?

215
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,568
Totally.

216
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:23,772
OK, that doesn't sound anything

217
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,608
like Ember or Starlight.

218
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:27,940
Who knows what their
dynamic would be, Spike?

219
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:41,376
Freaky.

220
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:44,772
Starlight will love it
in the dragon lands.

221
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,320
In her letters, Ember
said dragons do a lot

222
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,372
of fun things: The Feast
of Fires, the Dragon Bowl,

223
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:51,620
Clawchella...

224
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,028
Starlight could be there
for a really long time.

225
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,360
But then again, not
all dragons like ponies

226
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:01,084
as much as Ember does.

227
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,668
Hey, Twinkle Star!

228
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:05,700
It's uh, Starlight Glimmer.

229
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,152
Star-kle Light-star?

230
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:10,028
Starlight Glimmer.

231
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:11,764
Yeah Whatever. You
wanna hang with us?

232
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:15,112
What are we diving into?

233
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:16,948
Lava!

234
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,824
WHAT?!

235
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,988
Twilight, this is crazy!

236
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:24,864
Starlight's really
good with magic.

237
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,532
She could just stop
herself from falling

238
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:27,644
into a pit of lava.

239
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:30,848
What if she didn't
realize it was happening?

240
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:32,628
You just never know, Spike!

241
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:34,944
I just need to think of
someplace safe to send her.

242
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:36,848
Some place safe, some place
safe. Some place safe.

243
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:39,944
I could send her to
the Crystal Empire

244
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,344
to continue her magical
studies with Sunburst!

245
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:48,328
It'll be perfect!

246
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,748
Sunburst's knowledge of
magic is only matched

247
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,040
by Starlight's abilities.

248
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,080
I've got it! Try placing your
horn directly on the potion

249
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:58,840
and picture the clock
you wish to make.

250
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:05,872
They could challenge
each other into becoming

251
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:08,472
the most talented unicorns
Equestria's ever seen!

252
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,760
We did it! Quick,
what's next?

253
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:15,488
Of course, the study of
magic is a lifelong pursuit

254
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:17,516
and Starlight could
be there for a while,

255
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,900
especially once they
start attempting

256
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,720
the really complicated stuff!

257
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:23,764
Three... two... one...

258
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,052
What if they become
too ambitious?

259
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,300
I never would have thought
to combine Starswirl's

260
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,560
apparition spell with
spatium flexibus!

261
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,652
But what would
happen if we added

262
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,736
Sonambula's tempus
objectus?

263
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:38,212
If we do it just right,
it should allow us

264
00:14:38,236 --> 00:14:41,076
to materialize an object
that was lost in the past!

265
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,600
No, don't do it.

266
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,600
Starlight! NOOOO!

267
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:08,096
Twilight! Snap out of it!

268
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,232
Easy, Twilight.
It didn't happen.

269
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:14,588
But it could.

270
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:17,508
I just don't think I
can send her anywhere.

271
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,580
What am I going to do?

272
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:26,772
Are you laughing at me?

273
00:15:33,156 --> 00:15:35,552
I can't believe
you're laughing at me.

274
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:39,576
Oh, Twilight, I'm not.
I'm laughing because

275
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,884
I had the exact same
fears you're having.

276
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,712
What?

277
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:44,728
Let me tell you a story.

278
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:48,880
Once upon a time there was
a very bright young filly.

279
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:52,028
She was truly one
of my best students.

280
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:54,264
Are you talking about Twilight?

281
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:56,164
I can't see what
you're thinking about.

282
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,152
Yes, Spike.

283
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,716
I was constantly
surprised and impressed

284
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,612
with her discoveries.

285
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,872
But I noticed that her
pursuit of academia

286
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,532
was preventing her from
reaching her full potential.

287
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:20,284
You mean it was keeping
her isolated and alone?

288
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:21,800
Uh. Yes, Spike.

289
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,864
I had a decision to
make. But it wasn't easy.

290
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:30,520
Maybe I could close the library

291
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,776
or throw a party in the castle?

292
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,640
She'd have to talk to
the other fillies then.

293
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,144
I must send her away!

294
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,132
I knew there was a special
group of fillies in Ponyville,

295
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,796
but I kept inventing
all kinds of reasons

296
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,360
why I shouldn't send you.

297
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,388
What if she runs into a
manticore? Or what if

298
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:57,264
she gets pulled into
Tartarus? Or worst of all,

299
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,352
what if she doesn't
get along with anypony?

300
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,236
Are we supposed
to say something?

301
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,572
I don't think so.

302
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:07,028
I kept you in Canterlot
longer than I should have.

303
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:11,544
Eventually, I realized
all the anxiety I felt

304
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:14,240
was because I didn't
want you to go.

305
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:15,528
Really?

306
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:18,184
I loved having you
as a student.

307
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,932
You challenged me and
taught me just as much

308
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,252
as I taught you.

309
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,668
I am embarrassed to admit
it, but I was afraid

310
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:29,148
if you made friends, you
wouldn't need me anymore.

311
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:33,744
Princess Celestia,
that is so not true.

312
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,860
I will always need you.

313
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:38,576
I think Starlight Glimmer
might feel the same way

314
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,196
about you, if that is
what you're afraid of.

315
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:43,268
Maybe it is.
Just a little.

316
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:46,512
Oh, it definitely
is. Like a lot.

317
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:50,724
Here we are after all
these years, Twilight.

318
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,504
We are living proof
that letting someone

319
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,392
spread their wings doesn't
mean you no longer have

320
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:58,236
a place in their lives.

321
00:17:58,628 --> 00:17:59,352
Thank you.

322
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,956
And if you're still worried,

323
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,300
you can always make
her write you letters!

324
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,668
I may have let it slip
that you'd be unveiling

325
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:19,168
your big plan for Starlight
tonight. Silly me.

326
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,324
But we're all very excited to
hear what you've cooked up.

327
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,276
You weren't coming up with
a plan just now, were you?

328
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:35,028
Oh, dear. This could be
pretty embarrassing for you.

329
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,332
Gee, thanks Discord.

330
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:40,168
Anytime. I really do
love being helpful.

331
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,624
If I could have
everypony's attention.

332
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:49,120
As you all know, Starlight
Glimmer has been my pupil

333
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:52,232
for a while now and I'd
hoped she'd be my pupil

334
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:55,316
for a long time yet to
come, but it turns out

335
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,268
that's just not meant to be.

336
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:02,008
Starlight, you have proved
yourself to be a kind,

337
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:06,448
loyal, strong, honest
and truly magical friend.

338
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,320
Just looking around
this room at

339
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:09,936
all the new friendships
you've made,

340
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:12,244
I know there's nothing
more I need to teach you.

341
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,672
So we have a second
reason to celebrate today.

342
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,752
Three cheers for
Starlight Glimmer

343
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:19,516
on her "graduation" day!

344
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:24,992
EEE WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE!!

345
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,684
Your future is in
your own hooves now.

346
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:30,908
Wow. I was not expecting this.

347
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:35,916
Darn it. I was hoping you'd
send her to my realm.

348
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,192
We could have been roomies!

349
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:39,992
Way to not pick up what
I was putting down.

350
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:44,208
How do you wanna celebrate?
Girls trip to Las Pegasus?

351
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:46,888
We can throw you a
changeling Gorbfest!

352
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,292
Uh, it's more fun
than it sounds.

353
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,652
Or we could go cause
a little mischief.

354
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:58,400
I know a trick that'll turn
Celestia's castle into cheese.

355
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,536
Do you think it's
a gouda idea? Ha!

356
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,056
That's just the first
of many cheese jokes

357
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,568
if we go down this path.

358
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,656
That all sounds
wonderful but um...

359
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:11,132
Give me a minute, would ya?

360
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:15,396
Congratulations!

361
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,392
Thanks!

362
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,556
So, how do you feel?

363
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:21,668
Happy, surprised, overwhelmed...

364
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:26,112
I mean, not that I'm not
grateful but are you sure?

365
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,580
Believe me, I've thought
long and hard about this.

366
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
Of course you did.

367
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:36,152
Starlight, trust
me. You're ready.

368
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,484
Yeah.

369
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:40,228
No, I'm not.

370
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,716
What are you
talking about?

371
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:43,500
I'm not ready to leave!

372
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,528
Oh, good! Cuz I'm not
ready for that either!

373
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:48,984
Here. I got you
this present.

374
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:52,920
It was going to be a

375
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:54,816
'congrats on getting a
medal of honor present',

376
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,152
but then I was afraid
it would have to be a

377
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,592
'going away' present
but now it's a

378
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,308
'I couldn't be happier
you're staying' present!

379
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:03,204
It fits perfectly over your
dresser. I know. I measured!

380
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:05,284
Thank you.

381
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,556
I may not know what
comes next for you,

382
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:11,436
but whatever it is, I promise
I'll always be there for you.

383
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,892
Ohhh!

384
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,436
Phew!
