00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:05,971
<i>Please put your hooves together</i>
<i>  for your next performer...</i>

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,773
           <i> Maud Pie!</i>

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,748
   What do you call an Alicorn
   with no wings and no horn?

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,551
          "Earth Pony."

5
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:21,052
       [Pinkie Pie shrieks
         with laughter]

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,192
   But seriously, being an
    Earth Pony isn't so bad.

7
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,494
  We've got magic powers, too.

8
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,462
     Like walking around...

9
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,032
      and picking stuff
       up with our teeth.

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,603
   That's sarcasm by the way.

11
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,810
   It's funny cause it's true!

12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,182
   My favorite thing to
   listen to is clastic rock.

13
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:53,085
  The accumulation of sediments
   over millennia forming

14
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,422
      to create sandstone,
       shale and breccia.

15
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,991
       It sounds something
         like this.

16
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,165
       And that's my time.

17
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,200
       Pinkie: Hahahahaha!

18
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,702
   Isn't my sister Maud the
  most hilarious, entertaining,

19
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,272
     AMAZING comedian ever?

20
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:05,959
           Your jokes!

21
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,993
    Your hilarious delivery!

22
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,327
     Your.. your EVERYTHING!

23
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,132
How was my... timing?

24
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,900
         Ha! You got me!

25
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,336
     C'mon! Let's celebrate,
       sister style!

26
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:20,506
 We could get matching stickers
  that say "Eyes on the Pies!"

27
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,841
    then show them off at the
  Ponyville Sticker Convention

28
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,611
     that I could plan for
     tomorrow if you want?

29
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,813
                   Actually, I'm
                   busy tonight.

30
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,015
       Aw, that's what
       you said yesterday.

31
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,851
    And the day before that.

32
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,554
       And the day before
      the day before that!

33
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,557
[sigh] It's just, we haven't hung
out in a really long time

34
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,392
       because you always
        have other plans,

35
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,195
 even when you promised to build
  whip cream pyramids with me.

36
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,602
 I know. I am sorry, Pinkie. The
   reason is I have a--

37
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,271
               Apology accepted.

38
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,206
          As long as we get some
          serious sister time

39
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,358
           before your birthday.

40
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,409
              And there's uh,
            definitely no reason

41
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,278
       I want to hang out
      before your birthday.

42
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,548
   Just, you know, not
   planning anything special.

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,183
               OK.

44
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,651
               What about
               tomorrow morning?

45
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,218
     OK.

46
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,220
              Yay!

47
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,239
        Just you and me!

48
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,957
                  Best Sister
                Friends Forever!

49
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,361
Best Sister
Friends Forever.

50
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,596
       I can't wait for
      tomorrow to be today!

51
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,900
           Eeeeeeeee!

52
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,435
       Tomorrow is today!

53
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,206
    Who's ready for some fun
   times at Sugarcube Corner?

54
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,408
       The answer is YOU!

55
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,544
   I would also accept "Maud."

56
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,279
              Maud?

57
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,547
              MAUD?

58
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,786
          [gasp] Oh, I get it!

59
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,721
       We're playing hide
         and go seek!

60
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,863
               Ah-HA! Found you!

61
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,434
          Where's Maud?

62
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:40,991
      I've already checked
      Discord's dimension,

63
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,548
       Granny Smith's wax
    museum, AND Yakyakistan!

64
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,384
       She HAS to be here!

65
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:49,021
  Nope, it's just me, reading.

66
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,793
        Story checks out..

67
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:55,895
           OR DOES IT?

68
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,563
It does.

69
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,566
    But are you sure
    there's nopony hiding...

70
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,334
         IN YOUR CLOSET?

71
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,138
Pinkie...I don't
have a closet.

72
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,507
Is everything OK?

73
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,009
    No. I was supposed to go
     birthday cake shopping

74
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,644
        with Maud today.

75
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,646
And ruin her
surprise party?

76
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,449
      I wasn't going to
      tell her why, silly!

77
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,384
         But now I can't
         even find Maud.

78
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,121
    I'm usually way better at
    hide and seek than this.

79
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,422
Oh, she probably just found
a new rock formation

80
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,091
and forgot you two
were gonna hang out.

81
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,326
Tell you what, you
take care of the cake,

82
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,461
and I'll look for Maud.

83
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:30,929
             Really?

84
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:31,997
Thanks, Starlight!

85
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:35,735
Just checking.

86
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,977
 I've got to get very important
ingredients for a very important

87
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,047
 pony's cake, and it's gotta be
  tippy-top-super-duper-secret.

88
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,983
             Technically... it's
             not your turn yet.

89
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,452
Oh, I'm sorry.

90
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,120
Didn't mean to cut
in front of anypony.

91
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,693
              Um, whatcha doin'?

92
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:04,429
  I am currently speaking to a
  pony at a baking supply shop

93
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,999
      two minutes before it
        closes for lunch.

94
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,201
             Riiiiight.

95
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,636
               OK..?

96
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,505
    It's just that I'm trying
      to plan a party here,

97
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,374
     and the clock is
    ticking while you, uh...

98
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,309
   What are you doing, anyway?

99
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,878
         I am currently
          speaking to--

100
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,314
       I mean, can I help
      you move this along?

101
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,348
    What are you looking for?

102
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,800
   Rolling pins? Cupcake tins?

103
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,051
       Cookie cutters with
         tails and fins?

104
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,454
            Goodbye.

105
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,993
THAT'S what you've been standing
 here all this time to say?

106
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:39,065
I was deciding between
"goodbye" and "see you later."

107
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,767
                  Uh...but...they're
                 the same thing!

108
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,503
      Technically?
     They're very different.

109
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,772
   "See you later" implies an
    event in the near future

110
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,908
    wherin we see each other.

111
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,244
    "Goodbye" expresses good
      wishes where parting

112
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,447
        or at the end of
         a conversation.

113
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,948
        Yeah. Same thing.

114
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,085
    I will not apologize for
    speaking with precision.

115
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,021
          In that case,
      apology not accepted!

116
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,489
 Goodbye-later-seeya-same thing!

117
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,158
    Ah! Can you believe that guy?

118
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,161
              Huh?

119
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,795
         "Out to lunch?"

120
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,097
          Oh, come on!

121
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,201
 Ugh. No Maud, no cake, no anything!

122
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,670
 And how annoying was that pony?

123
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,038
       Who takes that long
         to say goodbye?

124
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,540
   Or was it "see you later?"

125
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,675
 UGH, now he's got me doing it!

126
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,878
              Hello, Pinkie Pie.

127
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,113
      MAUD!

128
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:28,880
     Found you!

129
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,081
My turn to hide!

130
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,552
       I'm sorry I wasn't
      around this morning.

131
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,221
      Oh, psh, what are you
     apologizing to me for?

132
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,623
 I'm not upset, you silly willy.

133
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,792
                The reason is I
                 met somepony--

134
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:41,994
Want to hang
out right now?

135
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,595
I mean, I can see you're
not doing anything

136
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,698
with anypony else.

137
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:49,100
Unless they're invisible
or really small.

138
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,020
             Pinkie.

139
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,539
  The reason I've been so busy
 is that I have a boyfriend now.

140
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,507
             A WHA?

141
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,875
          A boyfriend.

142
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,977
           A WHAAAAAA?

143
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,312
          A boyfriend.

144
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,781
           A WHAAAAAA?

145
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,283
          A boyfriend.

146
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,151
       That's so exciting!

147
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,252
           MY sister!

148
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,954
            IN LOVE!

149
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,023
       Technically, we're
         "in like."

150
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,958
       Tell me EVERYTHING!

151
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,193
        Who is he? What's
       his favorite color?

152
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,246
     Does he like ice cream?

153
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:19,197
     If he were a bird, what
    kind of bird would he be?

154
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,367
Wait. Is he
actually a bird?

155
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,835
Oh! I don't know because you
haven't told me anything yet!

156
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,904
        You'll like him.

157
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,039
    We have a lot in common.

158
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,874
Well, I love you,

159
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,910
so I know I'm going to
love your boyfriend!

160
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,613
Oh! I can't wait
to meet him!

161
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,414
              You don't have to.

162
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,419
He's a rock!

163
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,222
And you love rocks,
so it's perfect!

164
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,690
[gasp] Is Boulder jealous?

165
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,026
      No, behind the rock.

166
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,529
  Mudbriar, are you back there?

167
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,599
                  Technically?
                  Not anymore.

168
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,934
       [gasp] WHA WHA WHAAAAA?

169
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,776
                Pinkie Pie,
              meet Mudbriar.

170
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,677
                Technically?

171
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,079
              We've already met.

172
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,047
You...?

173
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:09,981
              Yes.

174
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,616
              You?

175
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:12,517
              Yes.

176
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,885
              You.

177
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:14,920
              Yes.

178
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,988
            I mean... haha, you!

179
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,359
         You! You! You!

180
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,162
         Yes. Yes. Yes.

181
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,931
I'm sorry, let's
start over.

182
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,767
Hi! I'm Maud's
sister, Pinkie Pie.

183
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,470
                 I know.

184
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,039
   So...

185
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,340
How did...

186
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,476
You two meet?

187
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,611
         At a rock show.

188
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,646
Oh, you're into
rocks too?

189
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,349
              No. I like sticks.

190
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,152
Then why were you
at a rock show?

191
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,855
   It was a petrified wood show,
    which technically

192
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,624
          makes it a stick show.

193
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,093
       Except that in the
    permineralization process

194
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,563
  of petrification, all organic
  material is replaced with

195
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,500
     silicates, i.e. rocks--

196
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:05,236
 --while retaining the original
  structural elements of wood.

197
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,840
   Q.E.D. It was a stick show.

198
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,409
          I'm... really
        into sticks too!

199
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,945
        They're great for
        hitting piñatas!

200
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,313
             Aaahhh!

201
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,649
     Pinkie!

202
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,018
Oh, you
wanna go first?

203
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,220
            That is stick abuse.

204
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,254
     It is?

205
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,925
  I'm sorry.

206
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,460
Oh, this is awful, I am not
being a very good sister.

207
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,412
Let's start over.

208
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,863
I'm Pinkie Pie,
nice to meet you.

209
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,332
          Technically?

210
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,967
       We've already met.

211
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,903
      You should introduce
       Pinkie to your pet.

212
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:40,772
     Oh!

213
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,440
Your pet likes fetch!

214
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,375
                This<i> is</i> my pet.

215
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,244
             So no.

216
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,449
Aw. Look at Twiggy and
Boulder playing together.

217
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,152
               They're adorable.

218
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,287
It's just a stick.

219
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,789
         Don't be rude.

220
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,325
      Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

221
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,760
        One more time...

222
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,896
I'm Pinkie Pie,
nice to meet you.

223
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,464
          Technically?

224
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,033
       We've already met.

225
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:16,575
             AHHHH!

226
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,909
      I don't get this guy!

227
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,079
   Wow! Maud has a boyfriend?

228
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,647
              Agh!

229
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,482
        How can she like
        someone so weird?

230
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,221
       He has an inanimate
        object for a pet!

231
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:30,873
          So does Maud.

232
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:32,924
      Boulder has TEN times
         the personality

233
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,093
      of some random stick.

234
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,195
 Mudbriar too, for that matter.

235
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,364
   He's not like Maud AT ALL.

236
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,335
  Maud is hilarious, friendly,
  caring, and easy to talk to!

237
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,437
        Yup, that's Maud.

238
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,874
But this guy is awkward,
quiet, and kind of...

239
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,609
   strange!

240
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,478
                 Uh, that also
               sounds like Maud.

241
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,047
         Hah! You're so
        funny, Starlight!

242
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,767
         Maud is nothing
         like Mudbriar.

243
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,986
  If she were, then we wouldn't
 be best sister friends forever.

244
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,189
   Well, Maud obviously
   likes something about him.

245
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,727
        Maybe you just need to
       spend more time with him,

246
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,161
               find out what you
                have in common.

247
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,462
That's easy.

248
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,263
    Nothing!

249
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,567
                   You both care
                    about Maud.

250
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,303
           I know! He could help
            you with her party!

251
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,238
   I guess...

252
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,874
     And I'll keep Maud busy
     while you and Mudbriar

253
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,177
     plan the best surprise
      birthday ever!

254
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,646
         That, I can do.

255
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,183
         Listen. Maud's
      birthday is tomorrow

256
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,885
         and there's no
         time to waste.

257
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,587
        You're not afraid
       of slides, are you?

258
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,289
      No, wh-aaaahhhhhhhh!

259
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,024
           No reason!

260
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,726
            Weeeeee!

261
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,002
       Welcome to my PARTY
         PLANNING CAVE!

262
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,539
          Technically?

263
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,274
   Due to the speleothems
    growing from the ceiling,

264
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,810
        this is more of a
       cavern than a cave.

265
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,412
      Maud taught me that.

266
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,013
            Yeah OK.

267
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,818
  Here's what I'm thinking for
    her surprise party:

268
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,420
    edible rock candy plates,
      gem-shaped ice cubes,

269
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,755
        a pebble piñata--

270
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,191
   --uh, we'll skip that one.

271
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,494
               Might I make some
                 suggestions?

272
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,830
Oh, suggest away!

273
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,365
That's why you're here.

274
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,168
 You and me,
planning... together.

275
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,770
    Friends.

276
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,540
    I have a vision board of
     everything Maud loves,

277
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,142
        and none of those
        things are on it.

278
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,077
               Hm.

279
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,446
 Let me see this "vision board."

280
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,347
   It's not a physical thing.

281
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,685
       I'm envisioning it.

282
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,054
    I enter through the large
     door of my mind palace

283
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,356
   and enter to the back where
     I have all of my books

284
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,660
  and possessions and what do I
  encounter, The Maud Room.

285
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,930
 None of those things are there.

286
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,932
       Just as I thought.

287
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,034
  Maud doesn't like surprises.

288
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:58,870
     Where does it say that?

289
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,439
     She never told me that!

290
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,942
Mm. It sounds like she was
 protecting your feelings.

291
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,144
   She's very caring that way.

292
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,447
       Stop acting like you know
       my sister better than me!

293
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,849
Technically, I never said that.

294
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:17,222
              Well, technically,
               I don't care!

295
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,290
 And since I've been best sister
  friends forever with Maud

296
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,694
     my entire life, I think
      I'M the expert here!

297
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,097
   Oh, but fine. If you don't
   believe me, let's ASK HER.

298
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,399
 BUT WE HAVE TO BE SUPER SNEAKY!

299
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,335
    Can you be more specific?

300
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,470
                    NO!

301
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,613
Huh! You must
be Mudbriar!

302
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,748
I'm Starlight Glimmer,
nice to meet you!

303
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,584
I've heard great things.

304
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,854
I'm so glad the two of you
are spending time together!

305
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,958
       So, how's it.. going?

306
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,162
 Mudbriar and I have just spent
   the BEST time bonding

307
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,930
    and we're really starting
     to make some headway

308
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,499
    becoming besties, except
    for one teensy weensy

309
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,701
     disagreement that maybe
     you could settle, Maud.

310
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,603
       See, Mudbriar here
        seems to think

311
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,406
       that you don't like
        surprise parties.

312
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,409
       Isn't it funny how
        WRONG HE IS?

313
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,078
   I like surprise parties...

314
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,490
Hmm?

315
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,948
       ...because I know they
        make you happy

316
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,483
         when you throw
          them for me.

317
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,018
     See?

318
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,071
      WAIT, WHAT?

319
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:25,123
  I'd rather just do something
   small with you, Starlight,

320
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,326
      Boulder, and Mudbriar
        for my birthday.

321
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,928
            No party?

322
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,596
               NO. PARTY?

323
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,832
Did he put you
up to this?

324
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,300
       Mm mm.

325
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,602
         Maybe you should
         consider, I don't know,

326
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,071
       taking things a little
     less serious with Mudbriar,

327
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,073
    because he's kinda, sorta...

328
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,008
       IMPOSSIBLE TO LIKE.

329
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,178
         Hey, Mudbriar!

330
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,180
Have you ever flown a kite?

331
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,048
Lemme tell you
all about it, see,

332
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,984
the first thing
you should do is...

333
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,286
 I just can't believe you would
 choose sitting around with him

334
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,622
        over a party with
        your own sister.

335
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,425
I didn't "choose" either of you.

336
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:01,827
          Technically?

337
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,828
       I said I wanted to
      be with both of you.

338
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,464
          TECHNICALLY!?

339
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,867
       UGH! You even like
        the way he TALKS?

340
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,902
Everything about
him makes me happy.

341
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,057
   Then I guess you don't need

342
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,475
    a best sister friend
    forever forever anymore.

343
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,946
            Pinkie...

344
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,083
    Wait, let's all slow down
      and talk about this--

345
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:29,385
                No! [blubbering]

346
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,623
                See you later!

347
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,397
       I don't understand!

348
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,600
  How could Maud like Mudbriar?

349
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,702
       Is it opposite day?

350
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,104
      Nothing makes sense!

351
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,239
         <i> I'm not shy! </i>

352
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,541
     <i>  And I hate animals. </i>

353
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,176
           <i> Fashion? </i>

354
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,445
      <i> Not for me, Darling. </i>

355
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:59,617
   <i> Pthew, an apple a day
    is downright disgusting. </i>

356
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:04,188
 <i> Slow and steady wins the race. </i>

357
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,257
   <i> I never learned to read! </i>

358
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,864
 WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE CUPCAKES?

359
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,310
          Good morning!

360
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,346
    Oh, wait... bad morning.

361
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,617
       GET OUTTA BED, SIS!

362
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,719
       IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
      HERE, YOU GOTTA WORK!

363
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:36,954
               Oh.

364
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,794
 You're probably wondering why I
  came back to the family farm

365
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,529
          in the middle
          of the night.

366
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:45,764
            Mmm-hmm.

367
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,532
 Well, it all
  started when--

368
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,600
                  Less talking,
                  more farming!

369
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:50,719
             Mmmmm.

370
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,237
It's just... Maud
has a boyfriend.

371
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,939
        I'm not jealous.

372
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,641
Who said anything about jealous?

373
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:57,843
   Don't be!

374
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,644
He's super-duper weird!

375
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,913
     And somehow he tricked
      Maud into liking him.

376
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,048
And now I'll never get
to see her again.

377
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,352
  I came home because you two
  know her better than anypony.

378
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,487
       What am I missing?

379
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,655
    What does she see in him?

380
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,257
 What does he have that I don't!?

381
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,329
      Buck up, Pinkie Pie!

382
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,430
      You look as miserable
     as I feel all the time.

383
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,204
 It's just.. that I love Maud
  and I WANT to love Mudbriar,

384
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,740
    but I can't see anything
    to LIKE about him!

385
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,878
           Ugh, fine.

386
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,246
   We're taking a work break.

387
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,114
             C'mon.

388
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,919
   I'm looking at a sparkling
   bright blue and white rock.

389
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:42,688
             See it?

390
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,890
  You mean that lumpy gray one?

391
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,894
No, the beautiful blue and
white one, right there.

392
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,397
  I would not describe that as
   beautiful, blue, or white,

393
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,834
       but... heh heh, OK!

394
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,236
            Show her.

395
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,173
          It's a geode.

396
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,142
     The outside looks
      like a regular rock,

397
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,678
    but the inside is filled
    with beautiful gems.

398
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,779
       So you're saying...

399
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,515
      I should crack open
      Mudbriar like a rock!

400
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,718
       IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

401
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,553
      No wait, it doesn't.

402
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,889
It's a METAPHOR, Pinkie!

403
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,392
   You see Mudbriar as a rock,
   but Maud sees him as a gem.

404
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,528
      Even if you never see
       past his dullness,

405
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,964
      you CAN see how
      happy he makes Maud.

406
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,199
     And to a sister, that's
       all that matters.

407
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,300
Mmm-hmm!

408
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,641
        Oh, Limestone,
       Marble, thank you.

409
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,776
      I don't know what I'd
       do without you two!

410
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,444
            PIE PILE!

411
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,982
     OK, OK. You're crushing
      me to gravel, Pinkie!

412
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,785
      I really owe
      Mudbriar an apology.

413
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,621
     [gasp] And I owe Maud a party!

414
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,555
  I just hope I'm not too late!

415
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:07,171
     I brought you an olive
      branch to say sorry.

416
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,907
   I was really unfair to you,

417
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,642
 and I'm ready to listen to your
   ideas for Maud's birthday,

418
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,146
      if you still want to
        plan it together.

419
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,249
     Technically, this isn't
      even an olive branch.

420
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,986
      It's a<i> quercus,</i> most
      likely<i> castaneifolia.</i>

421
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,188
           OH COME ON!

422
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,158
             Uh... Sorry.

423
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,061
     Keepin' it together...

424
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,463
                   And I love a
                  good<i> quercus</i>.

425
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,664
                        Friends?

426
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,233
   Friends!

427
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,136
Now, do you have any
ideas for the party?

428
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,605
                 There is one...

429
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,149
            SURPRISE!

430
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,803
 This is my favorite party ever.

431
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,305
     It was all your amazing
      boyfriend's idea.

432
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,507
 He said the best present would
  be me throwing you a surprise

433
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,576
 party you didn't have to go to.

434
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:19,745
 Technically?

435
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:22,613
It wasn't a surprise because
she could see the pre-party

436
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,416
   preparations from up here.

437
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,151
  "Technically..?"

438
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,253
You're right!
