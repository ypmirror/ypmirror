1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:02,985
  Twilight: Princess Celestia,

2
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:05,303
       I have an idea for
       your Onesversary!

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,639
        My...Onesversary?

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,075
  The one thousand one hundred
   eleventh year anniversary

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,844
        of when you first
         raised the sun.

6
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:13,512
Good thing Pinkie
Pie reminded us,

7
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,281
or we woulda forgot
to celebrate!

8
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,382
    You're not the only ones.

9
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,718
   What did you have in mind?

10
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:22,353
 To commemorate your first
  sunrise, I've written a play.

11
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,690
   We'd like to perform it at
    my School of Friendship.

12
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:25,791
       If you don't mind.

13
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,627
[excited laugh] Ooh!

14
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,628
   Mind?

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,463
Oh, of course not!

16
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:35,600
      Oh, I think a play
      is a fantastic idea!

17
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,636
Did she just...
 prance?

18
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,440
       Oh. Forgive me for
       getting so excited.

19
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:42,741
         I-it's just...

20
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,478
    When I was a filly, my
   friends often put on plays.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,516
    Oh, it was so wonderful;
    everypony coming together

22
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:54,019
 to create a magical experience
    to share with others.

23
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,489
  I've always believed theatre
   brings out the best in us,

24
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,259
      and forges a special
       bond of friendship.

25
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,027
             [gasp]

26
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,094
I didn't know you used to act!

27
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,197
           Oh, not me.

28
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,432
      I was always too busy
      with my magic lessons

29
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,435
        to be part of any
        plays myself.

30
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:13,238
But still, it's something
I always wished

31
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,773
I could experience.

32
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,475
       And you still can!

33
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:17,894
      Princess Celestia...

34
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,812
  we would be honored if you
 would be the star of our play!

35
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,347
            WE WOULD?

36
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,788
You want me to
star in your play!?

37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,824
             Yeah, when did that
               happen exactly?

38
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,859
       If you'll excuse
       us for a second...

39
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,529
      Don't you see, Spike?

40
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,581
          It's perfect!

41
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,432
  Princess Celestia has always
   wanted to be in a play,

42
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,902
    and this one's about her!

43
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:17,987
                  I guess...

44
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:19,871
         But how are we supposed
         to give her directions?

45
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,840
   She's the ruler of Equestria!

46
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,442
     She's also our friend.

47
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,844
       Celestia's always
       kind to everypony.

48
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,047
 So if we have a chance to
  finally do something for her,

49
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,149
           we should!

50
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,668
                      Hmmm.

51
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,586
C'mon, how many times
has Celestia helped us?

52
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:35,455
Guided us.

53
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,723
Been a warm calming
voice over our shoulder-

54
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:38,890
 Twilight?
 [startled gasps]

55
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,726
     Yes, Princess Celestia?

56
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,994
Your invitation
is very kind.

57
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,030
But are you certain
  it's wise?

58
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:48,166
I have no acting
experience at all.

59
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,035
        Experience? Pssh!

60
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,636
   You'll be playing yourself!

61
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,971
     And we'll all help you.

62
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,206
             Please?

63
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,006
        It'd mean so much
         to the students

64
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,342
    if you were in our show.

65
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,878
     Well, if you're sure...

66
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,715
      Yeah, what she said.

67
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,352
Then I would be delighted
to join your theatre troupe!

68
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,020
            Whoo hoo!

69
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,791
       Confetti is ready!

70
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,326
            Hoo hoo!

71
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,528
    Wormy applecores, Pinkie!

72
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,030
  How many times have I told ya
  to keep your special effects

73
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,899
       away from my sets?

74
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,501
   Three hundred twenty-seven.

75
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,136
    Ooh! Unless you just DID.

76
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,670
        Then it's three
      hundred twenty-eight!

77
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,907
              Ugh.

78
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:30,375
I can't believe you've memorized
your lines already, Fluttershy.

79
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,211
  Once you get past terrifying,
    paralyzing stage fright,

80
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,513
        the rest is easy.

81
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,147
         Now I just hope
        Princess Celestia

82
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,783
    says we can do our play.

83
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:41,653
     Oh! As soon as she sees
    these fabulous costumes,

84
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,789
       all she'll be able
       to say is 'brava!'

85
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,676
            Heads up!
          Here comes our answer.

86
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,763
Wonderful news, everypony!

87
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,265
             Yeeeha!

88
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,666
   We get to put on our show?

89
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,685
          Even better.

90
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:58,203
      Princess Celestia is
       gonna be our star!

91
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,404
             [gasps]

92
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,640
Yeah, that's how I felt, too.

93
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,376
 Celestia? Starring in our play?

94
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,677
          This is huge!

95
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,513
Well, she was a little
nervous at first,

96
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,182
but I told her not to worry.

97
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,717
With us helping, it'll
all go smooth as--

98
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,818
                   SILK! [zoom]

99
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,222
      I must find the silk!

100
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,990
      If Celestia is going
       to be in our play,

101
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,493
   we have to take everything
   up to the next level!

102
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,129
        None of these old
         ideas will do!

103
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,298
         Yeah! Forget my
      regular party cannon.

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,634
For princess-size effects, we're
 gonna need "Big Bertha!"

105
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,436
             [crash]

106
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,938
   Applejack: Grrr... PINKIE!

107
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,239
              What?

108
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,241
  Our play is gonna be AMAZING!

109
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,843
 I gotta tell everypony I know!

110
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,111
   And even the ones I don't!

111
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,413
           [zoom] [bang]

112
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,383
   Why in tarnation are y'all
     gettin' so star-struck?

113
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,585
       We've met Princess
        Celestia before.

114
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:47,654
        Plenty of times.

115
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:51,322
    Those were formal things,
      galas, world-saving.

116
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,958
       This is different.

117
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,328
      Imagine doing sweaty
    warm-ups with a princess.

118
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,597
      Blowing your nose in
      front of a princess.

119
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,067
     Sitting around just...
    talking with a princess.

120
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,703
I'm a princess.
You talk to me.

121
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:06,456
               That's different.

122
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,907
              You're not a
              PRINCESS princess.

123
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,943
          Uh... thanks.

124
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,712
Celestia wants to experience
  the special friendship

125
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,147
that theatre ponies have.

126
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,649
To give her that, you just
need to be yourselves.

127
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,151
                You...you really
                 think so?

128
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,254
     Heh. Aw, quit frettin'.

129
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:24,423
       It's only a coupla
      pals gettin' together

130
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,391
  to put on a Onesversary play.

131
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,926
      What could go wrong?

132
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,580
  Spike: Places, everypony.

133
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:33,132
  We're here to rehearse
 "A New Day in Equestria!"

134
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,900
                   Ahem.

135
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,503
Directed, written, and
produced by Twilight Sparkle.

136
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,341
         Page 1, Act 1, Scene 1.

137
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,375
                   ACTION!

138
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,581
        Once upon a time,
        before Celestia,

139
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,717
     Equestria was suffering
       terrible hardship.

140
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,186
      Raising the sun every
      morning was so hard,

141
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,188
  it took five great sorcerers

142
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,058
       plus Starswirl the
      Bearded to do it.

143
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,463
            [grunts]

144
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,265
            [clatter]

145
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,534
   And every day, the unicorns
