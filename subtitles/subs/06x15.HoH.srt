Fluttershy: I'm so sorry I lost
track of time on our picnic.

2
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:09,409
I didn't mean for us to get
caught out here after dark,

3
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:12,092
but there's really
nothing to be afraid of.

4
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:15,224
The forest at night is the same
as the forest during the day...

00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:21,310

Still, maybe we should
hurry back to the cottage.

11
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,144
Nothing to worry
about. No reason to...

00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,581
RUN!

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,298
AAAHHHH!

24
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:13,144
That wasn't funny.
You really scared me.

25
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:14,393
I hope you're happy.

00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,043
[low snarl]

27
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:21,126
Nope. You're too easy.
You're scared of everything.

28
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,070
That's not true!

29
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:24,664
Boo.

30
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,323

I mean, how could you
not appreciate that?

34
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,818
Because I don't think
being scared is very fun.

35
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,335
I do! Your heart
gets all racey!

36
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:23,138
Your hooves get all tingly.
Your mouth gets all dry-y.

37
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:27,532
Actually, I don't like that
part, but the rest is great!

38
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,956
See? Everypony likes a good
prank. They're just jokes.

39
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:33,692
Rarity: Now, Rainbow Dash,

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,963
I don't think Fluttershy
would have called us all here

41
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,326
to talk about this if she
thought it was funny.

42
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,298
Everypony has things they
like and things they don't.

43
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:44,030
And scaring Fluttershy
is just lazy.

44
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:46,326
LAZY?

45
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:47,963
A prank isn't
very good

46
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:49,643
if you're the only
pony laughing.

47
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,396
But what if it's really,
really, really, really,

48
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:53,009
really, really funny?

49
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,935
And I can do funny.

50
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,963
I know you can. I guess
the trick is making sure

51
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:59,175
that your idea of funny

52
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,200
matches the pony you're
pranking. That way-

53
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,540
[fart sound]

54
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:06,787

57
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:20,473
Good one, Rainbow! You have
to admit. That was funny.

58
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:22,418
Not really.

59
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:26,018
Yeah. A whoopee cushion
is like a joke shortcut.

60
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,520
WHAT!?

61
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:28,947
Rarity: Honestly, Rainbow Dash,

62
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,923
if you are not willing
to put forth the effort

63
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:33,575
required to pull a prank
that everypony can enjoy,

64
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:35,556
you may as well not
pull one at all.

65
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,612
Fine. If you ponies
want effort,

66
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:41,735
then that's just
what you'll get.

67
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:46,061
I'm not sure she
understood what we meant.

68
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,713
I know you're excited about
the Filly Guide cookie drive,

69
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,990
but I still have to do
a few finishing touches

70
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,104
on your uniform.

71
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,726
Mmmm. Not bad.

72
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:06,689
Hmm. "You asked for it."

73
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,944
What does it mean?

74
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:12,233
Hmm. I assume this is
Dash's idea of a prank.

75
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,713
Which can only mean she's
rigged some kind of booby trap

76
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,676
to your Filly Guide
uniform up there.

77
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,935
So... how do we
get it down?

78
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,606
We don't. If Dash thinks
I'm going to fall

79
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,812
for whatever she's
got in mind,

80
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,166
she's got another
thing coming.

81
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,347
There's more uniforms
where that one came from.

82
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:36,080
Mmm. The sewing machine
cake is actually better

83
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,335
than the cake cake!

84
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:39,587

00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:05,415
Uh, yeah. Sorry about that,
but Rainbow Dash has been

91
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:08,344
on a pranking tear and you
can never be too careful.

is gonna try to prank you

you know nothing about all
the pranking Rainbow Dash

120
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:20,240
has been doing?

00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:23,655
Oh, no. She's been
pranking up a storm!

Well, she needs to stop.

are so much fun.

doesn't seem like Dash

is taking the time to
find out who enjoys them

131
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:49,507
and who doesn't.

132
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:54,763
Uh, since you and Dash
share such an... affinity

133
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:59,224
for pranking, we thought you
might be able to get her to, um...

134
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:00,769

00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,418
Hey, Rainbow Dash!

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,612
I have something very
important to tell you.

137
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,046
Pinkie! Hey.

138
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:20,578
I actually have something
totally important to tell you!

00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,390
You do? Oh.
You go first!

140
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,698
OK, you know how I've
been pranking everypony?

141
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:31,581
Yeah. It's been
pretty funny.

142
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,766
I-I mean, actually,

143
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:36,307
that's what I have
to talk to you about.

144
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:37,716
Here, have a cookie.

145
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:39,384
Oooh. Thanks.

146
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:43,618
So I got to thinking,
why waste my time

147
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,889
pranking every
pony one at a time,

148
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,369
when I could prank
everypony at once!?

149
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:53,304
Wow. Everypony at
once? That sounds amazing.

150
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,880
Uh. Wait. I mean,
it's not...

151
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,769
You don't even know
what it is yet.

152
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,812
Pinkie, this is going to
be the best prank ever!

153
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,673
I special ordered
these joke cookies

154
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,809
so the colors would
match my mane.

155
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:08,861
And...?

156
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,935
And I'm gonna switch them
with the Filly Guide Cookies.

157
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:15,156
When Scootaloo and
her friends sell them,

158
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:18,258
everypony in town's gonna
get a rainbow mouth,

159
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:23,716
courtesy of Rainbow Dash, ha
ha! It's gonna be so awesome.

160
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,138
Uh, I don't know.

161
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:29,520
I mean, it doesn't really
seem all that funny.

162
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:31,378
WHAT!?

163
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,369
Maybe this is a good time to
stop pranking for a while.

164
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,184
The other ponies
in town have--

165
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:40,701
STOP!? No way! This prank
is happening, Pinkie.

166
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,796
And it's going to
be hilarious!

00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,606

Filly Guide Cookies

170
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:02,504
for the joke cookies.

171
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:05,304
But when you didn't show, I
had to do it all by myself!

172
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,027
Uh, Pinkie?

00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,680
Wow. Your face is
still pretty rainbowed.

175
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,166
Yeah. I haven't really [cough]
[cough] been feeling well,

176
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,289
and these joke cookies
are the only thing

177
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,963
that makes me feel better.

178
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:27,950
You don't have any
more, do you?

179

to turn the tables on you.

358
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:26,953
Aw, shucks. It was nothing.

359
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:28,941
Just a little something
I threw together.

360
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:30,763
Uh...

361
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:33,636
Wow. You should
see your face.

362
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,870
Ha ha! Talk about funny!

363
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,316
Well, I don't think
it's very funny!

364
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:43,452
And I'm the one that got
pranked. I was really scared.

365
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,550
I thought I made everypony sick.

366
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,984
You can't just go around...

367
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:48,990
Pranking whoever
you feel like?

368
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,575
Without thinking about how
it might make them feel?

369
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,243
Or if they'd even enjoy it?

370
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,200
Or think it's funny?

371
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:59,963
Yeah! Oh. I see
what you did there.

372
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:02,547
Pranks can be a lot
of fun when everypony

373
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:05,347
has a good time. I thought
you just needed to see

374
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:07,163
what it's like
when they don't.

375
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:10,775
I guess I did. I'm
sorry, everypony.

376
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:14,080
I haven't really been thinking
about how other ponies feel.

377
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,818
Well, I hope you
learned your lesson.

378
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,981
Totally! You ponies pulled
off an amazing prank.

379
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:22,529
I'll have to work
extra hard to top it.

380
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,169
[crickets]

381
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:26,160
Gotcha!

382
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,907
[laughter]
