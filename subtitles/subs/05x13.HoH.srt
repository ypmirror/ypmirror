power was enough to enable it

[rooster crows]

327
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:52,544
[gasp]

328
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,784
Luna did it!

329
00:20:56,992 --> 00:21:01,620
She sure did! Only, I'm not
exactly sure WHAT she did.

330
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:04,460
Luna created the Tantabus
to punish herself.

331
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:07,248
The worse she felt,
the more power it had.

332
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,541
But once she finally
forgave herself

333
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:10,800
for what Nightmare Moon did...

334
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:11,700
Poof!

335
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:12,608
Shhh!

336
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,341
Huh. Wonder what she's
dreaming about now?
