1
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:27,893
                 Huh?

2
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,932
 [gasp] Some poor creature's in
 trouble. We have to help it!

3
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:40,373
Oooh! Listen to that suffering!
 It must be in horrible agony!

4
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,315
    Oh! It sounds like a herd
     of injured Chimerae.

5
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:58,090
  Or, it's Cerberus with
sniffle-itis in two of his heads

6
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,826
    and kennel cough in his
     third, or maybe it's-

7
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,031
          Pinkie Pie..?

8
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:11,604
That's me! And a one, and a
 two, and a I know what to do--

9
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:20,279
    Ugh. At least no animal is
    suffering, right Angel?

10
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:24,417
     [out of tune tuba and
     bagpipe sounds]

11
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,487
        [nervous laugh]
        Well, until now..

12
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,776
             What <i>is</i> that thing?

13
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,012
It's called a Yovidophone.

14
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,616
  It's from Yakyakistan, where
  it's actually quite popular.

15
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,051
       Is it supposed to
       sound like that?

16
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,622
Not exactly. It's
known to produce

17
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,691
a fairly complicated
melodically rich and
harmonious tone.

18
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,871
   Are you sure we're talking
   about the same thing?

19
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:59,777
   Phew! And that's with only
   a few days of practice!

20
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,647
             Can you believe it!?

21
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,518
        Yes. Yes, I can.

22
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,520
         I can honestly say I've
          never heard anything

23
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,722
             like it in my life.

24
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,423
 Well, if you enjoyed listening
 to my playing half as much

25
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,994
as I enjoyed playing my playing,
then I should totally play more.

26
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,229
    That way we'll be even!

27
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,099
Oh, I don't think that's
necessary, Pinkie.

28
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,702
         Please. Don't.

29
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,205
   There's a chance I may
   have missed a note or two

30
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:29,609
   here or there, but I just
  love playing so much!

31
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:32,578
        [sigh] You.. complete me.

32
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,080
    Well, I for one am glad

33
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,950
    you're having so much
    fun with your new hobby.

34
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,020
         Uh-huh, sure.

35
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,490
   And it's great that you're
   learning a new skill and--

36
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,192
and you're just waiting
for me to finish talking

37
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,261
so you can start playing
again, aren't you?

38
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,197
   No! But if you're done...

39
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,434
  And-a one, and a two,
   and-a I know what to do...

40
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,143
      Oh. It's OK, she's gone.

41
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,145
    Anypony else think that
   sounded like an apple core

42
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,747
  caught up in a pulp grinder?

43
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,283
                  Applesolutely..!
                 A-Absolutely.

44
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,819
        OK, so maybe she
        isn't good yet,

45
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,722
    but she's our friend and
    we should be supportive.

46
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,359
She just started playing. She's
bound to get better. Right?

47
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,530
Yeah, we just need to be
 supportive of her practicing.

48
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:29,000
  So the getting better part
  happens as fast as possible.

49
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,273
              Ah!

50
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:37,876
              Agh!

51
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,989
     Ah! You're absolutely
      right, Spike.

52
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,425
    Sometimes it is nice to
    get out of the library

53
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,961
       and be in the sun.

54
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:05,230
    Especially when you take
     the library with you.

55
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:12,003
 [gasp] We need to do something about
 Pinkie Pie's playing.

56
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,472
        Like <i>now</i>!

57
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,307
     Is it really that bad?

58
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:17,762
        Does <i>this</i> answer
         your question?

59
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,411
                   Uh, a trophy?

60
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:25,316
For second place. SECOND. PLACE.
All because of Pinkie's playing.

61
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,787
And I wanted to turn heads
with my new fall line,

62
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,790
but not like this! [sobbing]

63
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,626
And thanks to her fruit
blastin' melodies,

64
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,162
I've got an orchard full of
nothing but apple sauce,

65
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,331
   and it ain't even
   saucin' season!

66
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,834
 And just look what her playing
 did to poor Fluttershy..

67
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:48,339
 Oh! So very tired. It
 practically took me all night

68
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,709
       to get the nursery
         back to sleep..

69
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,745
I mean, I know we said we
should all be supportive,

70
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,780
but Pinkie's been
playing for moons now

71
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,449
and she's not
getting any better.

72
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,719
      Yeah, if anything,
      she's gotten worse!

73
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,688
  OK, maybe we can just
   pretend she's really good

74
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,090
      and then I'll find
      a spell that will--

75
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:08,360
Oh, no no no, we're not
going through that again!

76
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,794
Remember how well
it worked out

77
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,663
when you weren't
honest with Celestia

78
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,532
   about her acting ability?

79
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:17,436
   [groan] You're right. We'll just
    have to tell Pinkie Pie

80
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,071
      she's not very good
      at the Yovidophone.

81
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,546
     Well, there's no time
     like the present.

82
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,988
      Phew! That's weird.

83
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,791
 I could have sworn this place
   was packed a second ago.

84
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,597
 Hey guys! Can I favor you all
 with a tune? I take requests!

85
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,499
Actually, we do
have a request

86
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,901
and yeah, it involves
your Yovidophone.

87
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,472
 You mean the thing I love more
than anything else in Equestria?

88
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:57,776
     My sun, my moon, my
     stars! My everything?

89
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,744
      Oooh. Tell me! Tell
         me! Tell me!

90
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,413
  All right, in all honesty...

91
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:07,818
Uh... In all honesty,
Rarity has something to say.

92
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,424
     Pinkie, Please! Listen
     to Rainbow Dash!

93
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,828
    Ugh. Fine. So Pinkie...

94
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,963
    remember when we all
    were shocked to discover

95
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,033
    Princess Celestia wasn't
     so good at acting?

96
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,135
      Yeah, she was awful!

97
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,538
   But that's kind of a
   random thing to bring up.

98
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,140
 I thought you wanted to talk
 about my Yovidophone playing.

99
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:36,281
Well, it's ah, it's just... you
 need to know the...Twilight?

100
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,551
[sigh] Pinkie, we
all support you,

101
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,353
but we're afraid you're just
not good at the Yovidophone

102
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,355
and none of us want
you to waste your time

103
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,258
on something you
can't do well.

104
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,528
       Oh. Why didn't you
        just say so?

105
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,269
Ah! We were all really
nervous to tell you.

106
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,438
       Why? It's just a
       silly instrument.

107
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,441
 Well, lunch break's over,
 gotta get back to the bakery.

108
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,811
 Those apple turn-overs aren't
  gonna apple themselves!

109
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,716
No more Yovidophone
playing for me!

110
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,621
   Wow. She took that so much
   better than I thought!

111
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,738
      No more Yovidophone
      playing for me...

112
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,143
   And a one, and a two, and
   I don't know what to do...

113
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,858
       [sigh] Another beautiful
       day in Ponyville.

114
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,528
Uh, Twilight, when was the
last time you saw Pinkie Pie?

115
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,865
 Hmmm. Not since we told her to
 stop playing the Yovidophone.

116
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,268
    I'm still surprised with
     how well she took it.

117
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,905
I don't think she took it as
well as you think she took it.

118
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,141
Top of the
morning to ya!

119
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,378
        Is it morning? I
        hadn't noticed.

120
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,013
                That's not good.

121
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,014
 Rainbow Dash: There you are!

122
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,083
       We've been looking
       all over for you!

123
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,052
  It turns out Pinkie may not
   have taken our critique

124
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,153
   of her Yovidophone playing

125
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,222
       in the spirit with
     which it was intended.

126
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,290
  I saw.

127
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,031
There's gotta be
something we can do.

128
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,301
 I'm sure there is, Spike. We
 just have to figure out what.

129
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:40,138
Ugh. I don't get it! So she's no
good at playing the Yovidophone.

130
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,491
      What's the big deal?

131
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:44,843
There's soooo many other things
 she's really good at doing!

132
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:48,313
Yeah. Not being able to play
the Yovidophone is nothing

133
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,849
compared to all the
things she can do well.

134
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,551
And that's exactly
what we'll show her!

135
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,954
     I bet if we get her to
     do the stuff she likes

136
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,456
 <i> and</i> is good at doing, she'll
  cheer right back up

137
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,725
      and forget all about
      the Yovidophone.

138
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,494
Hoo whee! That's a
great idea!

139
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,735
 Let's get started. Apparently,
 there's not a moment to lose!

140
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,574
             Achoo!

141
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,053
     So, I'm guessing
    nopony had any success?

142
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,157
      Huh. My party cannon
      idea was a real dud.

143
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,961
   Don't blame yourself.
   None of us did any better.

144
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,697
 Well, not to worry. I came up
  with the perfect solution.

145
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,233
  Instead of trying to remind
   her what she's good at,

146
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,037
we'll remind her what she's best
at. And that's being our friend!

147
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,507
 We're going to throw her a
 Pinkie Pie appreciation party!

148
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,576
That's a
wonderful idea!

149
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,546
If anypony needs to know
how much she's appreciated,

150
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,147
it's Pinkie Pie!

151
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,849
        We can get the
      whole town involved,

152
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,620
just so she can see what a good
  friend she is to everypony!

153
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,022
    Then I hearby officially
     declare today

154
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,191
     "Pinkie Pie
       Appreciation Day!"

155
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,939
Now <i>this</i> is perfection!

156
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,408
     Yeah, if anything can
     help Pinkie cheer up

157
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,343
     and make her forget
     about her Yovidophone,

158
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,379
     this is definitely it!

159
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,248
     It sure is. OK, who's
     going to get her?

160
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,951
   No need. Gummy's on it.
   In fact, there he is now!

161
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,297
Uh, Gummy? You were supposed to
bring Pinkie Pie. What happened?

162
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,200
Is she still coming!?

163
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,805
  Fluttershy, can you
  understand what he's saying?

164
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,742
I could... if he
was talking.

165
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:09,981
      Let me try something.
     Gummy, where IS Pinkie Pie?

166
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,853
     Maybe we should
      just go and get her.

167
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,358
What in tarnation
is goin' on here?

168
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,694
    This decor is dreadful!

169
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,564
      And all of Pinkie's
      stuff is... gone?

170
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,298
        It is a puzzle.

171
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,399
Maud: Excuse me.

172
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,900
              Oh, yes of course.

173
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,177
       Um, Maud, can I
      ask you a question?

174
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,311
You just did.

175
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,581
                 Well, can<i> I</i> ask
                 you a question?

176
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,117
         You just did.

177
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,652
Agh! Fine! How about if
<i> I</i> ask you a-- wait.

178
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,654
        Oh, for goodness
          sakes. Maud!

179
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,523
     All of your sister's
   things are gone. Explain.

180
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,625
No, they're not.
They're right here.

181
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,297
                   Have you seen
                    Pinkie Pie?

182
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,101
       Lots of times. I
       grew up with her.

183
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,574
OK... let's try this
a different way.

184
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,143
Why did you pack up
all of Pinkie's things?

185
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,578
                She asked me to.

186
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,413
    What!?

187
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,747
               Pinkie told me to
               pack up her room

188
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,782
             and take everything
             to the rock farm.

189
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,716
    WHAT!?

190
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:19,851
              She said she
              wouldn't need them

191
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,752
              since she's moving
              to Yakyakistan.

192
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:22,920
          WHAT!?!?

193
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,994
   Terribly sorry, Maud.
    Must have misheard you.

194
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:35,198
It almost sounded like you said
Pinkie's moved to Yakyakistan..
[chuckling]

195
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:38,036
Uh, Rarity, she
<i> did</i> say that.

196
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,906
     Uh... terribly sorry,
     Applejack; must have
     misheard you.

197
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,743
  It almost sounded like
   you said she did say that.

198
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:50,681
Maud, I don't understand. Why
would Pinkie leave Ponyville?

199
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,918
       Yeah. Why would she wanna
       go live with the Yaks?

200
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,720
        She said without
        the Yovidophone,

201
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:56,921
          her life had
           no meaning

202
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,473
       and at least
        in Yakyakistan,

203
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,324
      she could listen to
       the masters play.

204
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,361
 She hoped that would give her
 some semblance of happiness.

205
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,998
Well, no. Nononono!
That will not do.

206
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,133
I say we go to
Yakyakistan right now

207
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,535
and make her
come back home.

208
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,504
  We can't just march up there
  and tell Pinkie what to do.

209
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,308
   But, we didn't even get
    a chance to say goodbye.

210
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,211
    Well, we may not be able
    to go to Yakyakistan

211
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,249
  and force her to come home,
  but we could go say goodbye.

212
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:27,652
And if we happen to mention how
much her friendship means to us,

213
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,755
   and how much we'd miss her
   if she were gone forever,

214
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,393
  and then she decided to come
    back home on her own...

215
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,061
    Then what are we waiting
    around here for?

216
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,964
        Let's get going
        to Yakyakistan!

217
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,008
      We're almost there.

218
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,117
Pinkie's got to be
around here somewhere.

219
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,551
                   But where?

220
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,720
 [Beautiful Yovidophone music]
Is that..?

221
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,790
 The music of the Yovidophone.

222
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:10,028
  Are you sure? Because that
  actually sounds kinda good.

223
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,862
     Oh, I'm sure. Come on!

224
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,348
   Huh. Not what I expected.

225
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,782
                      Shhhh!

226
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,650
         Oh, sorry.

227
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,884
                      Shhh!

228
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,556
            Tch. I said I was sorry!

229
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,757
     Fluttershy: Ah! There she is!

230
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,128
         Gimme another.

231
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,131
          But pony already had
            twenty-five ice--

232
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,300
    [bang] I said GIVE ME ANOTHER!

233
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,136
           Pardon me.

234
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,104
           Excuse us.

235
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,238
             Sorry!

236
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,275
       I feel nothing.

237
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:58,943
                Maybe we can
                 help with that.

238
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,515
     Oh. Hey. What are
      you guys doing here?

239
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,017
               Just hear us out.

240
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,020
    We respect your decision
    to move to Yakyakistan.

241
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,889
  But we just wanted to remind
  you how much you mean to us,

242
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,492
 and how much we'd miss you if
 you decided to move here for--

243
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,861
Fine. I'll move
back to Ponyville.

244
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,498
   Wow. That was a lot easier
 than I thought. We're awesome!

245
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,869
           Pinkie, what's wrong?

246
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,571
That's what's wrong.

247
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,506
   I thought coming here and
   listening to real

248
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,775
      Yovidophone playing
      would make me happy.

249
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,613
But it makes
me feel worse.

250
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:37,482
I'm never going to
sound like them.

251
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,885
Yovidophone Fan-pony
watch instrument

252
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:44,022
while Yigrid visit
little Yak's room?

253
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,291
Eh, if I can't play it, I
 might as well do menial chores

254
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,993
       for those who can.

255
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:53,197
  OK, so Pinkie Pie is
   obviously still miserable.

256
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,300
Oh. I can't bear to
see her like this.

257
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,104
                Indeed. But what
                else can we do?

258
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,673
 Yeah, we've tried everything!

259
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,876
Maybe not! Look!

260
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,013
            Hee hee!

261
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:13,785
  Whoops! Sorry. I forgot what
  an awful Yovidophoner I am.

262
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,287
 Playing it makes you so happy!

263
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:20,825
      [sigh] It sure does.
       I mean it did.

264
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,094
  Then you should never stop!

265
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,495
                  So say we all!

266
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,964
                     Absolutely!

267
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,232
     But you were the ones
      who told me to stop

268
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,800
     because I wasn't good.

269
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,135
              And we were wrong.

270
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,937
                   Playing makes
                    you happy.

271
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,705
And as long as it
makes you happy,

272
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,707
it doesn't matter
how good you are.

273
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,311
So get up there and show
these yaks how it's done!

274
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,780
   [loud whisper] I don't
    know if you've noticed,

275
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:47,051
 but the audience are all yaks
 and they kinda have "issues"

276
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,387
    with things
     that aren't perfect...

277
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,589
        like my playing.

278
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,525
    Pinkie Pie, you get up
    on that stage and play.

279
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,396
 If these Yaks don't like it,
 they'll have to answer to us!

280
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:03,267
  Well, OK. If you all say so...

281
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,304
    Ahem. Ladies and gentle yaks!

282
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,839
     Performing for her
     very first time here,

283
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:14,045
   let's give a big round
   of stomps for... Pinkie Pie!

284
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:20,652
      Ahem. Um, hi. So er.. any yaks
     here from out of town?

285
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:28,259
OK. And a one, and a two and a
uh, kinda remember what to do...

286
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,151
       Uh, I kinda wasn't
        expecting this.

287
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,385
Me neither.

288
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:58,423
Oh! Pony play good set.

289
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,459
          You think so? Even
       though it wasn't perfect?

290
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,829
Yovidophone is
instrument of happiness.

291
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:10,935
 Playing Yovidophone make pony
happy. Pony playing IS perfect!

292
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,371
     Well, if that's the
     case, let me play you

293
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,139
     the song I just wrote
    two seconds ago!

294
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,176
 It's called: "I've Got the
 Best, Most Supportive Friends

295
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,645
       a Pony Could Ever
           Ask For."

296
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,413
     It's a working title.

297
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:23,714
           And a one-

298
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:24,582
           And a two-

299
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,617
   And a you know what to do-
