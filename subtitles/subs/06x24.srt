1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,530
Spring training was awesome, but
I can't wait to see my friends!

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,470
I'm gonna catch up on some
Daring Do with Twilight,

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,430
help Applejack make
my favorite cider,

4
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:12,420
and have a sleepover
with Pinkie!

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,240
We get it, you have
a fun week planned.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,635
Meanwhile I'm stuck here running
trials week at the Academy.

7
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:22,250
But you love yelling and
blowing your whistle.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,530
Yeah. I do.

9
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,915
See you gals later!

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,630
Heh heh heh.

11
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39,030
Huh? Oh, the map!

12
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:48,310
Hey Twilight! So
where am I going?

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,605
The Crystal Mountains?
Vanhoover? Here?

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,600
Please say here.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,660
Well, the good news is we
both got called by the map.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,730
Awesome! Does that
mean there's bad news?

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,750
No! Well, not exactly.

18
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,015
Aww, I was just there!

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,340
Ahem.

21
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,390
All right newbies,
welcome to trials week

22
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,845
for the Wonderbolt Academy!

23
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,060
You'll be judged on your
speed, strength, agility

24
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,345
and technique, culminating
in a final evaluation.

25
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:09,595
Will it be hard? Yes.
Will you cry? Maybe.

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,055
Will you fly so much
your wings fall off?

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,290
That has only happened once.

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,950
She's just exaggerating
to make a point, right?

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,890
I mean, wings can't
really fall off, can they?

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,000
You think you've got what it
takes to be an elite flyer?

31
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:24,995
Yes, ma'am!

32
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:26,180
Yes, ma'am!

33
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:28,840
Well, let me tell
you, you don't.

34
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,185
I remember when she
said that to me.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,758
[excited hero-worship chatter]

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,360
You don't think Rainbow
Dash is the pony

37
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,145
whose wings fell
off, do you?

38
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:50,855
Quit yer whisperin' and give me
five hundred laps! Go go go!

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,460
Um... I just wanted you to know.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,275
You two are my favorite
ponies in all of Equestria.

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,585
Well, isn't that sweet. Now
get going on those laps!

42
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,295
Welcome, Princess
Twilight!

43
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,365
What are you doing
back so soon?

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,480
Official Friendship business.

45
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:12,675
Have you noticed anypony having
a hard time with their friends?

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,300
Not really. But it's
not my job to worry

47
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:19,630
about their relationships. I'm
here to make them elite fliers.

48
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,855
Adorable. They're so full
of hope and competition.

49
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,020
Their technique could
use some work, though.

50
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:30,420
You should tell them.

51
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,795
I'm sure they'd appreciate
any notes from you.

52
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,395
Nah. I wouldn't want to
mess with their confidence.

53
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:38,085
But they'll never get better if
they don't know what to work on.

54
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,580
Sloppy wing placement.
Crooked lines.

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,110
I'm gonna have to drill
them on basic technique

56
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,545
in the classroom portion.

57
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:46,170
Classroom portion?

58
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:49,805
Yeah. It's everypony's least
favorite part of trial week,

59
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:51,570
but it has to be done.

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,355
Maybe we can help.

61
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:54,685
We can?

62
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:55,870
Absolutely.

63
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,085
Between your flying skills
and my teaching expertise,

64
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:00,190
they could learn a lot!

65
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:02,935
Plus, once they get to know us,
they'll be more comfortable

66
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:04,765
coming to us with their
friendship problems.

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,675
Count us in.

68
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,350
Great!

69
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,315
You have your work
cut out for you.

70
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:18,890
Thank goodness I had time
to whip up a few charts

71
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,630
on flight patterns
and wing symmetry!

72
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,985
It's fresh in my mind from
when I learned to fly.

73
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,265
This is so exciting!

74
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,015
Maybe for you. I
practically fell asleep

75
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,980
when I went through
this. Tell ya what.

76
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:32,875
I'll leave the
teaching stuff to you

77
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,665
and I'll just make
sure they stay awake.

78
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,445
I'm pretty sure their thirst
for knowledge will keep them

79
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:40,785
bright-eyed and bushy tailed.

80
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:43,990
[laugh] Good
one, Twilight.

81
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,245
Wake up, newbies!
Class is in session.

82
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:52,320
Hello, students!

83
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:55,225
I'm Twilight Sparkle and
this is Rainbow Dash.

84
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,205
But you can call us T-Sparks
and the Dashinator!

85
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,515
Ahem!

86
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:03,120
Heh heh. Just kidding.

87
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,020
And we're here to go over
basic flying technique.

88
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,365
Uggggggh.

89
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,585
Who said that?

90
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,385
Me. I mean, we're here because
we're amazingly awesome

91
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:16,335
crazy good flyers. We're
waaaaay past basics.

92
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,065
What's your name?

93
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,685
Sky Stinger. You've
never heard of me?

94
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:23,470
He set the record
for the fastest

95
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:24,980
vertical acceleration rate.

96
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:27,590
500 feet in two seconds.

97
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,165
That's pretty impressive.

98
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:31,485
It's amazing.

99
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:33,200
Ahem. It is.

100
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:36,750
And we can talk personal
records after class, Ms--?

101
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:41,125
Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony.
I never fly without her.

102
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:43,735
But you'll have to
in the solo trials.

103
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:47,010
There are solo trials?

104
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,760
Yup. It's a part of
your final evaluation.

105
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
We'll ace that test with our
wings tied behind our flanks.

106
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,540
My picture will go
right up there...

107
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,995
...next to yours.

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,150
That's a mighty big claim
considering everypony here is an

109
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,670
"amazingly awesome
crazy good flyer."

110
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:06,855
I know.

111
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,810
OK!
Let's get back on track.

112
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:13,015
Now, who can tell me
the best wing angle

113
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,130
to achieve minimal
air resistance?

114
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,560
Wake up, newbies!
Class is in session.

115
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:33,270
Well, there were a
few hiccups,

116
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:35,075
but overall that
went pretty well.

117
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,985
Yeah. Nopony fell asleep.

118
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,615
What? I'm not
a student!

119
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,105
Hey, teach!

120
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,130
Me? Or Twilight?
Probably Twilight.

121
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,185
Uh, both. About
the solo test,

122
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:50,630
I'm actually kinda
worried about it.

123
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:52,385
Aw. That's all right.

124
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,685
We all have moments
where we doubt ourselves.

125
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,860
No. No. I have absolutely
zero doubts about myself.

126
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,035
I'm a strong flyer--like
really, really, really strong.

127
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,875
But this isn't about me.
I'm worried for Vapor.

128
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,075
Oh. Well... that is
very... kind? Of you.

129
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:13,510
Tell you what. It's almost
time for freestyle training.

130
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,815
Why don't you grab her and
show us what you've got?

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,715
Yes! Prepare to be
impressed. By me.

132
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,660
Like I said, Vapor
still needs work.

133
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:31,600
Well, he may be full of
himself but I have to admit,

134
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:35,775
Sky's an excellent flyer. He
must've shot up 200 feet!

135
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:40,080
But did you see Vapor Trail?
Her wing was under his.

136
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,105
I think she gave him a boost.

137
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,370
I guess I didn't
even notice Vapor.

138
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,330
I was too busy
watching Sky.

139
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,780
I think you're right!

140
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,715
Vapor just created a gust of
wind that caught Sky's wing

141
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,655
at a 45 degree angle, propelling
him into a flipping loop.

142
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,090
Somepony paid
attention in class!

143
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,905
Sky obviously has no
idea he's not actually

144
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,620
"amazingly awesome".

145
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,140
And Vapor's so busy making
her friend look good,

146
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,570
she's not focused on
her own flying at all.

147
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,205
This must be our
friendship problem,

148
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,265
and there's only
one thing to do.

149
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,455
Fix it without telling them!
Tell them the truth!

150
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:24,195
You don't want
to tell them?

151
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,595
Of course not. Flying
is like 30 percent skill

152
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,295
and 70 percent confidence.

153
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,485
You can't mess with
a flier's confidence.

154
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:34,140
But you can't improve if you
don't think you have to!

155
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,180
Besides, Vapor's keeping a
pretty big secret from Sky

156
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,620
and that can lead
to trouble.

157
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,485
Yeah, but if we tell
them that they've been

158
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,135
holding each other back,
that could be trouble too!

159
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,705
I nailed that
flipping loop.

160
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,580
I'm actually surprised
you're still here;

161
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,385
I thought I blew
you away.

162
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:53,120
You were great,
Sky.

163
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,595
Come on, Vapor Trail.

164
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:58,235
You're going to have to
build up your endurance

165
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,985
if you want a shot
at the Academy.

166
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:02,225
Wonderbolts don't
get winded.

167
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,985
Angel Wings! You call
that cloud busting?

168
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,010
That cloud barely
knew you were there!

169
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,650
I love my job.

170
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,610
We'll keep working
and who knows?

171
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,540
One day you might come close
to being almost as good as me.

172
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:19,935
Oh, I don't think so.

173
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,910
You were voted Stratusberg's
Most Promising Flier.

174
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:25,580
I was voted
Best Sneeze.

175
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,805
Achoo!

176
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,075
You do have a
really great sneeze.

177
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,365
Thanks, Sky. But I don't
think I can sneeze my way

178
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,000
into the Academy.
 I'm pretty beat.

179
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,580
I'm gonna hit the showers.

180
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,200
You have to help her.

181
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,890
Actually, she's
not the one...

182
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:44,660
Will do!

183
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:51,490
Hey, you did great. You're
a really strong flyer.

184
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,250
Me?

185
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,995
Vapor Trail, we know
what you've been doing.

186
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,590
You've been doing... great!

187
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,160
You've been helping Sky.

188
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:04,425
Uh. I don't know what
you're talking about.

189
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:07,525
Sky doesn't need anypony's
help. He's amazing.

190
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:12,985
Not without you. And it's
gonna be pretty obvious

191
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,265
during the solo trials when
he can't get enough air

192
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,260
to do a flipping loop.

193
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,825
Oh no. I can't let
that happen.

194
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,815
I mean--aww, sugarcubes!

195
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,730
Why are you doing
this for him?

196
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,625
It started when we were kids.
You have to understand...

197
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:32,635
...Sky grew up with a lot
of siblings. It was tough.

198
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,395
He was always trying to
get his parents' attention.

199
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,985
Meanwhile, I was an only child
who hated all the attention

200
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,125
I got from mine.

201
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:45,680
Vapor Trail! Where are you?
Do you need a snack?

202
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,345
Do you want to do homework?

203
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,430
Or we can just spend
some time together!

204
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,405
All day is never enough!

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,010
Mom! Dad! Up here! Look, look,
look, look, look, look, hey!

206
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,320
Mom! Dad! Can you see?

207
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,895
That was amazing!

208
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:23,220
Flying together gave
us both what we wanted.

209
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:27,655
But I never told Sky how
much I was helping him.

210
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,860
It started with a
small boost here

211
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,700
or a little gust of
wind there.

212
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,510
But I didn't think my help could
actually hurt his chances!

213
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,820
I understand. But now
you're both in trouble.

214
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:41,775
You need to work
on your tricks.

215
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,755
And Sky needs to be able to fly
without you or he won't make it.

216
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,280
Oh, but he has to! Flying
with the Wonderbolts

217
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:52,265
has been Sky's dream
ever since he was a colt!

218
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:53,475
What about you?

219
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,840
I-I guess I haven't
thought about it.

220
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:58,785
I just want to be
with my best friend.

221
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,445
Then we have to find a
way to help both of you.

222
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,505
Starting with telling
Sky the truth.

223
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,840
No! You can't. Sky
will be crushed.

224
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,445
And without his confidence
he won't fly as well.

225
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:14,320
Then I guess we'll give
Dash's method a shot.

226
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:19,270
Yes! I love being right.
OK. Here's what we do.

227
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,600
Sky needs to build his strength.
Air drills, wing lifts...

228
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,275
all that boring,
methodical stuff.

229
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,305
Sounds like my
cup of oats.

230
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,535
But how will we
get him to do that?

231
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,680
He doesn't think
he needs practice.

232
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:34,080
We'll just tell Sky that he
should practice with Twilight

233
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:36,405
so you won't feel so
self-conscious about getting

234
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,990
special training from me.

235
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,705
With you? Really?
You'd do that for me?

236
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:45,910
Ha. You say that like
it's not gonna be a blast.

237
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:06,130
Whoa!

238
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:06,980
Agh!

239
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,020
You were awesome!

240
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,195
Really? Thanks! I can't
believe I was able to keep up!

241
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:08,755
That's the first nice thing I've
heard you say about yourself.

242
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:09,870
Hey!

243
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:14,255
Can we switch now? I want to
do tricks with Rainbow Dash!

244
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,340
You can't. I mean... uh
you're already so good

245
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,930
at the fancy stuff.

246
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,980
And the basic stuff.

247
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,625
You're right. I don't
need to practice at all.

248
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,170
Um. Maybe, Sky,
you should...

249
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,005
I'm already the best and
everypony's gonna know it

250
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:33,900
when I'm asked to join
the Academy tomorrow.

251
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,360
But not if you
don't practice.

252
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,555
I wouldn't be surprised if they
asked me to become a Wonderbolt

253
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:43,220
straight out of the trials!
Boom. Dream achieved.

254
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,825
SKY YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE!

255
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:49,260
What did you say?

256
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:53,775
Sky. I want you to get
in as much as anypony,

257
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,905
and you're amazing, but...

258
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,025
But what?

259
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,090
I've been... helping you.

260
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,000
Please. I don't need
your help. Watch.

261
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,715
How could you do this
to me? Did you all know?

262
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:26,440
Oh great. So everypony
but me knows I'm a joke.

263
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,550
Was this your plan the whole
time? To embarrass me?

264
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:32,910
What? No! Don't
you know me at all?

265
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,335
I guess not since it took
me this long to find out

266
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:36,750
you're a terrible wingpony!

267
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:39,190
I can't believe you!

268
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,545
I can't believe I
was ever your friend!

269
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,460
Thanks a lot.

270
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,640
Do you think
they're still mad?

271
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,610
Yeah, they're still mad.

272
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,710
This is all my fault. If we
had just done things your way,

273
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,895
maybe we could've
avoided this whole mess.

274
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,960
No, it's my fault.

275
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:10,715
It hit me when I was
watching Sky train with you.

276
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,290
He wasn't even trying.

277
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:26,145
Oh no. He's lost
his confidence.

278
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,500
Do you want to tell me why one
of my most promising students

279
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,050
is flying like a balloon
with a hole in it?

280
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,545
Uh, it's a long story,
but we'll fix it.

281
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,010
Yes you will!

282
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,680
We really messed up, huh?

283
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,540
I have a plan.

284
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,420
Hey, Sky. I thought I
might find you here.

285
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,735
Well, apparently I
need a lot of practice.

286
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,110
Guess I'm not the
natural I thought I was.

287
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,030
No, you're not.

288
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,230
Thanks. Good pep talk.

289
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,130
I wasn't a natural
at friendship.

290
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:06,640
But with some practice and
some help from my friends,

291
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,125
I got better. And now? I'm
the Princess of Friendship.

292
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,965
So you're saying I can be
the Princess of Flying?

293
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:21,690
You know, you're really good.
You're lead pony material.

294
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,095
That's sweet of you, but no.

295
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,065
I couldn't handle
all the attention.

296
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:28,205
But you'll never
become a Wonderbolt

297
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:32,330
if you're too afraid to shine.
That is what you want, right?

298
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:36,105
Not at first. I just
wanted to be with Sky.

299
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,850
But learning to do all
those fun tricks with you?

300
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:41,945
It made me realize this is
something I want for myself.

301
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,050
I was hoping you'd say
that. Come with me.

302
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,965
What's she doing here?

303
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,890
Sky, Vapor was never trying
to steal your spotlight.

304
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:58,835
She thought she
was helping you.

305
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,740
And Vapor, you shouldn't
have been so content

306
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,045
to take a back seat.

307
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,855
Now you can either stay
mad, or help each other

308
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,185
and become two of
the greatest fliers

309
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,685
the Wonderbolt
Academy has ever seen!

310
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,035
Please pick the second option.

311
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,885
I don't want Spitfire
to be mad at me.

312
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:31,740
You've got this, Sky!

313
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:45,630
Focus on a cloud
when you spin!

314
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:47,515
It'll help you fly straight
when you come out of it.

315
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,455
Uh-huh!

316
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,285
Woo-hoo!

317
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:28,310
Woo! Yeah! Ha ha ha!

318
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,245
Oh yeah, way to go! Woo-hoo!

319
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:01,395
Congratulations.

320
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,560
You've both made it into
the Wonderbolt Academy.

321
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,675
Whatever you
did, it worked.

322
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,345
These two have a
lot of potential.

323
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,110
Who knows? They might even
be better than you, Crash.

324
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:19,890
OK,
let's not get carried away.

325
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,585
Um, I just wanted
you to know.

326
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:26,415
You two are my new favorite
ponies in all of Equestria.

327
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,405
Hey! I heard that!

328
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,150
I can't believe
we did it!

329
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,085
You were great! Even
though you can out-fly me,

330
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,090
you can be my
wingpony anytime.

331
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,900
And you can be mine.

332
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,105
Phew! It's good to be home.

333
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:07,055
You're telling me. Now
we can finally catch up

334
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,380
on some Daring Do; I can
make cider with Applejack...

335
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:16,990
Dash! I've been looking
all over for you.

336
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:20,070
Wonderbolt emergency!
We gotta get back to HQ!

337
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:26,255
You've got to be kidding
me! I was JUST there!
