1
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,975
        Care for a carrot
        ginger sandwich?

2
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,375
              Ohh.

3
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:14,346
      You remembered to cut
     off the crusts for me.

4
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:18,050
        Of course I did.

5
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,152
    I know how you like them.

6
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,426
       You really do make
     the best finger foods.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,163
What do you say?

8
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,765
           Excuse me!

9
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,300
Oh! I really can't
take them anywhere.

10
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,273
      Can I trouble you for
       another sugar cube?

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,712
      Oh, no. I'm so sorry,
      but I seem to be out.

12
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,314
[pop] Well, I can just
  pop us in some more.

13
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,214
               Oh that's all right.

14
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,484
                I need to go to
              the market anyway.

15
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,387
     I have to restock my pantry
    for our tea party next week.

16
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,490
Oh, I never realized
how much work you put

17
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,359
into hosting these
tea parties.

18
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,365
                 Oh, it's really
                 not that much.

19
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,866
No, no, no, no, no.

20
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,335
I've been taking advantage
of your hospitality

21
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,603
for far too long.

22
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,872
It's high time I do
something about it.

23
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,477
     What to do... What to do...?

24
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,880
Why don't you host
the next tea party?

25
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:22,780
            I've got it!

26
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,285
Why don't I host the next
tea party at my place?

27
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,087
Hey, that's my idea.

28
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,223
        Why didn't I see
          that coming?

29
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:36,593
       [escaping air hiss]

30
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,767
So Fluttershy...

31
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:18,537
what do you think of
my brilliant,

32
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,506
genius, amazing idea

33
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,275
of having the next tea
  party at my place?

34
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,312
          Are you sure?

35
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:30,482
     I wouldn't want you to
     go through any trouble.

36
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,152
      You, trouble? Never!
            I insist.

37
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,727
               Then count me in.

38
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,695
             I'm already looking
               forward to it!

39
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,364
       Me, too!

40
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,766
I'm so excited; I can't wait.

41
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,236
No, really! I can't.

42
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:53,973
How about we have the tea
party tomorrow afternoon?

43
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,673
              Sounds good to me.

44
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,378
  You know, Discord, I've never
   been to your house before.

45
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,115
Well, that's OK, because I've
never hosted a tea party before.

46
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,287
      Oh? I've never hosted
       a tea party before.

47
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,554
         So much to do!

48
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,691
      Thank you so much for
      the tea and nibblies,

49
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,460
   but I really must be going.

50
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,161
         Uh, Discord...

51
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:19,631
    before you go, would you
    mind helping me tidy up?

52
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,534
          There you go.

53
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,537
      Back to normal, just
      the way you like it.

54
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,872
See you tomorrow!

55
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,975
I can't wait!

56
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,348
   OK, since Fluttershy always
       goes out of her way

57
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,283
       to host the perfect
        tea party for me,

58
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,485
        how do I make my
        tea party for her

59
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,187
       even more perfect?

60
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,924
I'm sorry dearie, were
you talking to me?

61
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,660
Actually, Madam, I'm
talking to myself.

62
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,662
                 Well, I'm not
                 talking to you!

63
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,464
It's for Fluttershy.

64
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,765
         Oh, all right.

65
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,534
      No more holes though.

66
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:59,404
   You have to knock this tea
 party out of the park for her.

67
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,740
        She was our first
       friend, after all.

68
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,609
You don't have to
  tell<i> me</i> that.

69
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,412
She gave us a chance
when no other pony would!

70
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,348
         She makes us want to be
         a better draconequus.

71
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,284
           Fluttershy deserves
         the best of everything.

72
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,753
   Of course. I should get her
     the best of everything!

73
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,321
   Why didn't I think of that?

74
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,491
       Well, are you going
      to answer me or not?

75
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,759
               Me?

76
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,661
              I thought you were
              talking to--

77
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:24,930
--No time!

78
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,967
I'm off to prepare a tea
party worthy of Fluttershy!

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,107
           Excuse me.

80
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,676
Is this where Fluttershy
usually buys her tea?

81
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,478
         Why, yes it is.

82
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,778
         Oh, wonderful!

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,081
      I'll be enjoying her
        company tomorrow,

84
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:46,885
    so I will be needing your
     very best tea, please.

85
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,721
  Something especially special.

86
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,624
 I'm sure Fluttershy would enjoy
 some of our Rosehip green tea.

87
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,393
       Oooh. Interesting.

88
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:58,230
   Does it decorate your hips
   in roses or turn you green?

89
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,165
                Uh, neither?

90
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,700
            It just tastes good.

91
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,068
   How boring.

92
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,403
     Pass.

93
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,372
            Hold on!

94
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,074
          Ginseng tea.

95
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,476
Now that sounds promising.

96
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,511
What does it sing?

97
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:16,415
    I'm partial to something
        upbeat and jazzy.

98
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,852
     Again. It's just tasty,
    like all of our tea here.

99
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:24,089
So.. all this is just
tea you simply drink?

100
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,090
                    Uh-huh.

101
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,660
Oh! Seems that I got
here just in time.

102
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,330
       <i> ♪ La, la, baloo. ♪</i>

103
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,231
   <i> ♪ Sha loo ba doo ba dee! ♪</i>

104
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,633
        Singing ginseng!

105
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:35,933
          I'll take it!

106
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,171
       Are you sure you're
    friends with Fluttershy?

107
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,040
        You seem so very
       different from her.

108
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,709
Well, of course
we're friends.

109
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,478
She gets me and you
obviously do not.

110
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,280
      "Are you sure you're
    friends with Fluttershy?"

111
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,149
      Why, the very nerve.

112
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,653
I'm sorry, do you validate?

113
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,456
               Hello.
               Gah!

114
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,927
       Uh, can I help you
         find something?

115
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,631
        Yes you can. Your
     finest tea set, please.

116
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,433
    I want only the best for
     my friend, Fluttershy.

117
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,536
Uh,<i> you're</i> friends
with Fluttershy?

118
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,608
        Yes, judge-y clerk pony.

119
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,208
   Why is it such a surprise?

120
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,645
   Sure, she's on the quieter
       side and I'm a bit,

121
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,381
        well, more showy..

122
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,083
          but I'll have
    you know, we're besties.

123
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,621
      And that's why I need
        the BEST TEA SET!

124
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,390
Perhaps then you'd
be interested

125
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,492
in our classic
"Tea for Two" set.

126
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,597
  A teapot that just pours tea?

127
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,499
    How positively dreadful.

128
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,568
But that's all tea pots
are supposed to do.

129
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,237
                  Not anymore!

130
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,241
                  Much better.

131
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,410
                Don't wrap it;
              I'll walk it home.

132
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,250
        Now let's see, I
      have the perfect tea

133
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,218
  and the perfect tea service.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,587
     What else do I need for
     the perfect tea party?

135
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:03,855
               Oh!

136
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,724
     Decorations, of course!

137
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,364
    Good, but not nearly good
     enough for Fluttershy.

138
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,833
          Ta da! choo!

139
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,669
           Oh, ho ho!

140
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,238
                  Better.

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,141
Oh, I'll need napkins.

142
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:23,842
I'll simply make them...

143
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,143
   I could...

144
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,845
     or ...nope.

How do I make these better?

00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,017
What should I do?

148
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,252
Make them...

149
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:34,920
  make them glow.

150
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,923
That's not good
enough for Fluttershy.

151
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,025
Should I make them fly?

152
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,195
       Glow, fly and fold!

153
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:47,366
      Glow, fly, fold into
       fun shapes perhaps?

   friend, I need your advice.

160
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,749
   I'm hosting a tea party for
  her and it has to be perfect.

161
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,119
      No, it has to be even
      better than perfect!

162
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,488

      over-thinking things.

164
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,960
   All you have to do is make
  Fluttershy feel comfortable,

165
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,728
         which should be

            like me.

    But all I did was make it
  chaotic and weird... like me.

200
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,220
 What if those ponies at the tea
 shop and china shop were right?

201
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,056
   What if Fluttershy sees how
       crazy this place is

202
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,425
        and realizes how
        different we are

203
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,860
        and then doesn't
   want to be friends anymore?

        is that she loves

     But not on the ceiling.

   stairs.. that lead somewhere.

223

       never discussed it,

         turn us green?

273
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,525

00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,953
                 as I previously
                   mentioned.

283
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,291
              Would you care for
               some milk toast?

284
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:57,428
Uh.. Discord, you don't
seem to be yourself today.

285
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,230
Are you feeling
all right?

286
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,066
     What ever do you mean?

287
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:05,336
       Well, it's just...
      what you're wearing.

288
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,338
         And also, what
         you're saying.

289
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,207
        And.. also the way
        you're saying it.

290
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,109
       And um, pretty much
        everything else.

291
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,244
            Oh, dear Fluttershy.
                 Worry not.

292
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,979
           I can assure you that
            for the first time,

293
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,315
   I'm feeling perfectly normal.

294
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,517
         Now let me top you off.

295
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:20,885
                    Whoops!

296
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,286
                 Butter fingers.

297
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,688
               How embarrassing.

298
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,358
      Uh...what's going on?

299
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,530
                 I have no idea...

300
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,834
     [gasp] Discord! You're
     starting to fade away!

301
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,303
              Oh. You don't say.

302
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,772
               Have you read any
              good books lately?

303
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:49,848
              Huh!

304
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,048
                Have you tried
                  the scones?

305
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,885
              They're positively
                  delectable.

306
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,187
               The secret is in
               the extra butter.

307
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,122
     What is wrong with you?

308
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,926
    You're acting so "normal"
 which is not so normal for you!

309
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,728
          W-What ever do you mean?

310
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,197
       This is just me.. being me.

311
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,166
No, it's not!

312
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,602
It's you being like
  everypony else!

313
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,206
      Eeep!

314
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,343
     The more you do it the
       more you fade away!

315
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,079
Of course!

316
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,281
You're a creature of
    pure chaos!

317
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,716
Being normal is
destroying you!

318
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,286
   Oh, haha, how interesting.

319
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,589
 That reminds me of something I
   heard at the market today.

320
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,126
  STOP IT! Please.

321
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,729
You need to go back to being
your not-normal normal self!

322
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,399
Quick, Discord, do something
chaotic before it's too late!

323
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,467
             Please!

324
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,202
           Do something chaotic?

325
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,970
                      I'll try....

326
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,041
           Ohh, that's not good.

327
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,643
Oooh. Then I guess it's up to me.

328
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,645
       Uh, OK. All right.

329
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,546
          How about...?

330
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,617
             Oh, no.

331
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,386
     I tipped over that cup!

332
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,188
  That's pretty chaotic, right?

333
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,425
Ooh. What if I...?

334
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,031
Oh, my! Talking with food
       in my mouth

335
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:17,902
after taking a bite from every
    sandwich... how wacky!

336
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,271
Doing anything for ya?

337
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,942
            Oh... OK. Hmmm.

338
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,010
      Maybe I need to start
       thinking like you.

339
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,780
     Ooooh. What would Discord do?

340
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,216
  Well, I guess he'd probably
 make another version of himself

341
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,951
     to bounce ideas off of.

342
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,321
But one wouldn't be enough.

343
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,890
He'd need more. Way more.

344
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:50,034
   Hey there, Fluttershys, any
   ideas on how to Discord-up

345
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,202
         this tea party?

346
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,704
         Hi Fluttershy,
       thanks for asking!

347
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,074
     First of all, you gotta
     redecorate this place!

348
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,943
  I mean this is where Discord
  lives! And you're telling me

349
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,746
     there aren't any stairs
      that lead to nowhere?

350
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:02,781
             On it!

351
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:19,730
      Better, but it still
        needs something.

352
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,670
    Now that's more like it!

353
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,807
          It's working!

354
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,143
         OK, what else?

355
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,277
    Furniture on the ground?

356
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,577
         So predictable!

357
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,515
      Let's put them where
       they don't belong.

358
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,927
  And he'd have a chaise lounge
  that would actually chase you

359
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,629
  because he's funny like that.

360
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,564
    I bet you can't catch me!

361
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,037
          Ha ha ha ha!

362
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,777
   Oh, and Discord would have
     a special kind of tea,

363
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,314
       like a ginseng that
       could really sing!

364
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,716
I would! I-I would!

365
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,451
      <i> ♪ La, la, la, la! ♪</i>

366
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,322
      <i> ♪ Lala lala la la! ♪</i>

367
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,058
        And he'd serve it
      on a floating table!

368
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,258
  We've never talked about it,

369
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,361
       but I'm pretty sure
     Discord hates gravity.

370
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,530
I do! Who wants to be
tethered to the ground

371
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,466
   when you can do this?

372
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:34,139
     Haha! Now this is exactly
     what I was hoping for!

373
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,808
        This is what you
        were hoping for?

374
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,078
    But this is the complete
  opposite of your tea parties.

375
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,314
 I wouldn't expect you to throw
  a tea party the way I would!

376
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,648
                We're different.

377
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,483
             I know.

378
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,920
  I was afraid that if you saw
  exactly how different we are,

379
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,922
      you wouldn't want to
       be friends anymore!

380
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,191
      What!?

381
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,560
       Why would you ever
           think that?

382
00:19:55,962 --> 00:20:00,865
   Because... you and I don't
   make sense to anypony else.

383
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:04,168
That may be true, but
we make sense to me.

384
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,937
I never would have thought
to make singing ginseng

385
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,173
before I met you.

386
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,609
But you've opened me up to so
   many more possibilities

387
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,377
      and impossibilities!

388
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,746
       So I guess what I'm
        trying to say is,

389
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:19,283
    I like you<i> because</i> you're
      so different from me.

390
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,585
             You do?

391
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,887
Of course I do, silly.

392
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,624
Besides, what's Discord
without a little chaos?

393
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:30,995
 Well.. in that case, I certainly
 don't need to be wearing this.

394
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,296
             Whoops!

395
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,367
              Haha. I forgot that I
              still had this on.

396
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,705
  Now, about that tea party...

397
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,943
      You know, your garden
    really is looking lovely.

398
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,646
  Why, thank you for noticing.

399
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,749
    I also couldn't help but
 notice that you need a refill.

400
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,720
           Aie! Achoo!

401
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,423
  Gesundheit!

402
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,225
               It really is nice
               having you here.

403
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:02,925
      I'm happy to be here.

404
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:07,598
    And I really do like your
  place...<i> because</i> it's so you.

405
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,934
      Why thank you, Fluttershy.

406
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,969
        Now, how about we
        try some of those

407
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,204
        delicious-looking
           sandwiches?

408
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:16,807
             Ha ho!

409
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,275
        You read my mind.

410
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,716
      <i> ♪ La, la, la, la! ♪</i>

411
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,085
      <i> ♪ Lala lala la la! ♪</i>

412
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:32,657
          Yahoo!
