00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:11,237
Greetings, Tantabus. I am ready.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,912
Do your worst.

3
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:22,928
Princess Luna's turning into
Nightmare Moon...again!

4
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,597
Yeah? Well, we've got
the cure for that!

5
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:54,720
Wait! What is it doing?

6
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:59,413
NO! It's gone!

7
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:09,630
What?

8
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:12,230
My dream ended happily?

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,725
That cannot happen!

10
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:21,847
Regular by YayPonies
We have muffins!
http://yayponies.eu/

11
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,880
Ooh! This is amazing!

12
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:59,386
Yeah, Rarity, thanks
for setting all this up.

13
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,333
A grooming day for our pets
really was a great idea.

14
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,930
Oh my! Oh I'm sorry!

15
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:16,064
I didn't get my normal
beauty sleep last night.

16
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:21,445
You know, I didn't
sleep well either.

17
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,616
I'm totally beat, too!

18
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:30,058
All right, Winona,
time fer yer brushin'.

19
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:40,790
Whoops. I guess I'm too plumb
tuckered out to do this right.

20
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,018
I even went to bed
early last night.

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,994
But then I had a
really scary nightmare.

22
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:49,824
Me too!

23
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,300
Uh, only, you know, I didn't
think mine was THAT scary.

24
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:57,034
Well, mine sure was. There was
this blue smoke monster and-

25
00:02:59,290 --> 00:02:59,984
What?

26
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:03,045
I dreamt about a blue
smoke thingy too!

27
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,340
Me too!

28
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,480
So what? Probably
just a coincidence.

29
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:10,069
That's an awfully
big coincidence.

30
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,645
Huh. I wonder why I didn't
have that nightmare.

31
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:14,037
I slept great!

32
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,830
So then what could have given
us all the same nightmare?

33
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:22,954
I don't know. But I
do know who might.

34
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,701
Spike, could you send a
scroll to Princess Luna?

35
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:26,500
Sure.

36
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:28,458
All set!

37
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,581
Dear Princess Luna. Last night,
my friends and I all dreamt

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,629
of a creature made
of blue smoke.

39
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,264
I'm sure you're very busy, but

40
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:40,448
when you have the chance,

41
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:43,664
please let me know if you have
any idea what it could mean.

42
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:48,154
Yours, Princess
Twilight Sparkle.

43
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:49,738
You can leave out the yawns.

44
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:59,818
Which of you saw the creature of
blue smoke in your nightmare?

45
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:02,272
Wow! That was fast!

46
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,440
We all did.

47
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,098
Not me!

48
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,226
Ugh! We know!

49
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:10,101
So you've encountered
the smoke monster, too?

50
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:12,746
The Tantubus is a
creature of my nightmares!

51
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,077
It escaped from my
slumbers yesterday.

52
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:18,192
But, how did it get into ours?

53
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:20,450
The Tantabus is like a parasite.

54
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,864
My dreams must no
longer be enough for it.

55
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:25,397
Now it seeks others
to infect and corrupt.

56
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:28,630
It must have learned of you six
from seeing you in my dream.

57
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:31,680
Whoa whoa whoa! So what
you're saying is...

58
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:35,056
You dreamt about all
of them and not me?

59
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,312
So Smokey gave us bad
dreams. No biggie.

60
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:44,048
I saw that the Tantabus
had grown more powerful,

61
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:47,002
but I did not realize that
power was enough to enable it

62
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,213
to escape my dreams.

63
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,504
If its power grows,
it could very well

64
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,637
find a way to escape
into the real world.

65
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:57,248
It could turn all of Equestria
into a living nightmare!

66
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:05,962
OK, OK, OK! I take it back. That
does sound bad! Really bad!

67
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,661
We've prepared everything

68
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,042
exactly as you requested.

69
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:16,816
Good. As you six slumber here,
I will pursue the creature

70
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:18,880
into whichever of your
dreams it infests.

71
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,005
Ooh! It'll be like a
princess sleepover!

72
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,893
Speaking of Princesses, aren't
you going to ask Celestia

73
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:26,912
for her help as well?

74
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:28,990
There is nothing
my sister can do.

75
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,386
She has no power in
the realm of sleep.

76
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:33,760
Only I can move
from dream to dream.

77
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,430
I am afraid no pony
can help me tonight.

78
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,509
Even us?

79
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:39,050
Especially you.

80
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,920
You have all suffered
so much because of me.

81
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,488
You need only slumber

82
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:45,510
while I hunt the
Tantabus in your dreams.

83
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:50,405
I know you said no pony
can help, but I'm no pony.

84
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,765
I'm going to stay up and watch
over you guys just in case.

85
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,285
Oh, thank you, Spike.

86
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:00,933
One good thing about not
sleeping well last night:

87
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,424
shouldn't be too hard
to fall asleep now!

88
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,813
Are you kidding?
This is so exciting,

89
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,146
I don't know how
I'm ever going to -

90
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:46,400
Oh my! This is simply divine!

91
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:50,314
How avant-garde!

92
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,018
Forget avant-garde. I should
have said, "en-garde!"

93
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:06,128
It is here!

94
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:15,664
You were such a
pretty little chiffon!

95
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:19,189
What kind of monster
would do this?

96
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:20,670
The Tantabus.

97
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,298
Then let's stop it!

98
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:26,618
No! Please! I don't want you to
suffer any more because of me.

99
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:28,618
I will catch it!

100
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:40,784
It has jumped into
another dream!

101
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,640
I am sorry, but if
I am to stop it,

102
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,352
I must follow it
where you cannot.

103
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,130
Go!

104
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:48,700
I shall be able to
handle things here!

105
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:50,760
I hope.

106
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,274
<i> ♪ La la la la ! ♪</i>

107
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:57,800
<i> ♪ La la la la la! ♪</i>

108
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:01,034
I followed the Tantabus
here. Now I need only find--

109
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,416
Sorry! Can't help it. An
idea pops into my head and--

110
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:07,205
Oooh! Cake!

111
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,992
Eww! Cake!

112
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:27,701
No!

113
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:28,656
Sorry!

114
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,557
Who wants ice cream?

115
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,869
Hmmm. It's so nice to
be the pet for once.

116
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:53,190
N-n-nice, giant, evil Angel?

117
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,210
Whew! Oh, thank you, Princess!

118
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:12,710
Now, this is what I call
an incredible dream!

119
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,930
I can see the Tantabus has
already turned your slumbers

120
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:42,810
into a nightmare!

121
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,512
What are you talking about?

122
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,480
This is my favorite dream!

123
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:55,893
<i> ♪ We are such happy flowers! ♪</i>

124
00:09:56,176 --> 00:10:00,213
<i>♪ We will now sing for hours! ♪</i>

125
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:04,130
<i> ♪ Aren't we unbearably cute? ♪</i>

126
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,805
<i>♪ Watch me solo on jazz flute! ♪</i>

127
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:27,744
Huh?

128
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:39,184
Luna!

129
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:52,202
What happened? Are you guys OK?

130
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,714
That...that was terrible!

131
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:58,234
I...I never want to have
that nightmare again!

132
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,634
Me either!

133
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:04,672
But Luna caught it? Didn't she?

134
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:07,781
I am so sorry, my
friends. I failed.

135
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,112
It will be back to infect your
dreams the next time you sleep.

136
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:14,298
Oh, no!

137
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,765
Yeah, I reckon I could
live without seeing

138
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:19,440
that thing ever again.

139
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:23,008
But you will. Again
and again. Every night.

140
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,096
Until it grows powerful enough
to infect the waking world!

141
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:28,565
After what I did
as Nightmare Moon,

142
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:31,920
the fact that I am once again
responsible for harming others

143
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,472
is more than I can bear.

144
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,805
It'll be OK. Everypony
makes mistakes.

145
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:39,637
As long as none of you
dreamt about another pony,

146
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:42,160
the Tantabus remains
confined to your dreams.

147
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,900
I still have a chance to catch
it before it's too late!

148
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,837
Whew! That's good to hear.

149
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:48,928
Although after you left,
I did happen to dream

150
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,869
I was eating a giant ice
cream cone with all of Ponyville

151
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:52,440
while taking a test
we hadn't studied for.

152
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:56,240
See, what did I tell ya?
Everypony makes mistakes!

153
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:04,757
But that means the Tantabus
could be turning every dream

154
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,420
in Ponyville into a nightmare!

155
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:07,989
It is far worse than that.

156
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,242
Infecting all those dreams
gives it more and more power.

157
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,893
Soon it will be able to
escape into the real world

158
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:16,130
and infect Equestria with
its nightmare plague!

159
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,270
Then you must let us help you
stop it before that happens!

160
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:22,666
But how? The Tantabus
was able to escape Luna

161
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:25,040
when it only had SIX
dreams it could get to.

162
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:28,165
It is true. With so
many dreams to hide in,

163
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,325
I do not know how
I can catch it.

164
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:34,960
Hmmm. What if everypony in
Ponyville were having one dream?

165
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:39,066
I can create shared dreams, yes.

166
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:41,333
But for so many ponies at once?

167
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:43,413
I have never done
anything like that.

168
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:45,578
The amount of power
it would take...

169
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:49,221
Well, it is worth a try.
Isn't it?

170
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:52,130
Of course. I will do ing to end this.

171
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:53,877
Including accept your help.

172
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:56,981
I cannot allow the Tantabus to
escape into the real world.

173
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,402
All of you must now
go back to sleep.

174
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:02,874
And hope that I can
create such a dream...

175
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,840
Meow?

176
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:54,474
Big Mac! Boy, I'm glad to
see something familiar!

177
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:58,746
Eeyup.

178
00:13:59,642 --> 00:14:00,666
Ponies!

179
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,530
Princess Luna!

180
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,940
There is no time for
bowing, my friends.

181
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,540
There is something coming!
Something terrible.

182
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:12,580
No! It is already here!

183
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:23,258
I am so sorry. I brought this
upon you. But I will end it now!

184
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:32,630
Princess! What's wrong?

185
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,112
It is taking all my strength

186
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,218
just to hold this
massive dream together!

187
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:39,930
You will have to stop it!

188
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:43,173
I truly wish I did not
have to ask this of you.

189
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:45,936
Then you're in luck.

190
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,978
Yeah! We're already on it!

191
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,130
Please, I'll pay you anything!

192
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:12,549
Ya-wah!

193
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:15,008
I got ya!

194
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:36,464
Oh, no!

195
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:41,733
Big Mac! You can do anything
in a dream, remember?

196
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,350
E-wheeeeeee.

197
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:03,450
C'mon! If that Tantabus
thing turns any more

198
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:04,608
of this dream against us,

199
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:07,190
we'll be too busy saving
ponies to catch it

200
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:10,976
and it'll grow powerful enough
to escape into the real world!

201
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:14,869
How are we even gonna know
when it's able to escape?

202
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,741
Oh, I think we'll know.

203
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:33,909
Hurry, my friends!

204
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,770
What the--?

205
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,322
Please! We need your help, too!

206
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:50,394
Fluttershy's right! We've
all got to work together

207
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:51,968
to stop it from escaping!

208
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:56,176
But how can we help? No pony
in Ponyville has your magic.

209
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:57,780
Or your speed.

210
00:16:58,293 --> 00:16:59,248
That's true!

211
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:01,301
In Ponyville.

212
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:04,597
But this here isn't
Ponyville! It's a dream!

213
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:07,018
Eeyup!

214
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:10,060
And not just any.
This is YOUR dream.

215
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:13,230
Anything you can do in your
dreams, you can do now!

216
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:19,642
Well, if you're gonna dream,
might as well dream big, right?

217
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,893
He-ya!

218
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,900
MEOW!

219
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,186
It's working!

220
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:01,898
But it's not enough.

221
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:09,856
Then do more! This
is a dream, remember?

222
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:40,058
I cannot hold this
dream together much longer.

223
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:44,010
Equestria will
fall because of me!

224
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,992
Am I crazy or did it
just get even bigger

225
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,208
after Luna said that?

226
00:18:57,397 --> 00:19:00,197
I think it's feeding off
your guilt, Princess Luna!

227
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:04,245
If that is so, then perhaps that
is how it grew strong enough

228
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:05,813
to escape in the first place!

229
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:08,370
Say what now?

230
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:11,722
I created the Tantabus

231
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,341
to give myself the same
nightmare every night.

232
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,408
To punish myself for the evil
I caused as Nightmare Moon.

233
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,320
But why would you do that?

234
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:25,290
To make sure I
never forgave myself

235
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:27,898
for how much Equestria
suffered because of me.

236
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,272
But it seems I have
not learned my lesson,

237
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:33,237
for now I have only
made you suffer more!

238
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,042
But that means you might just be
the key to stopping all this!

239
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:43,002
Yeah! If it gets strong
because you feel bad

240
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:45,024
about what you did
as Nightmare Moon,

241
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:48,506
then you just gotta stop
feeling bad for what you did!

242
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:52,976
How can I forgive myself? I am
no better now than I was then!

243
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:57,936
My creation is about to turn the
world into a living nightmare!

244
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,181
But look at what YOU'RE doing!

245
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:02,298
Nightmare Moon would
have wanted the Tantabus

246
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,474
to turn Equestria
into a nightmare.

247
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:07,088
You're doing everything
you can to stop it!

248
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:08,512
Don't you see?

249
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,413
That proves you're not the same
pony you were then!

250
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:14,106
Everypony who knows you
knows that Nightmare Moon

251
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:15,240
is in the past.

252
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:17,310
We all trust you, Luna.

253
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:20,138
Do you trust us enough
to believe we're right?

254
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,450
I do!

255
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,176
Thank you. Thank you all!

256
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,784
Luna did it!

257
00:20:56,992 --> 00:21:01,620
She sure did! Only, I'm not
exactly sure WHAT she did.

258
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:04,460
Luna created the Tantabus
to punish herself.

259
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:07,248
The worse she felt,
the more power it had.

260
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,541
But once she finally
forgave herself

261
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:10,800
for what Nightmare Moon did...

262
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:11,700
Poof!

263
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:12,608
Shhh!

264
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,341
Huh. Wonder what she's
dreaming about now?
