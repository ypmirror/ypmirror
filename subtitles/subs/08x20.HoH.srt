426
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,170
        If I'd known you
        were gonna bail,

427
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,173
       I would have done
       the trick myself!

428
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,741
Great! So you won't
mind how that rope's

429
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,110
about to coil around your hoof!

430
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,614
        Rivals for LIFE!

431
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,518
Wouldn't have it any other way.

432
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,120
I'm sorry for joining
the Washouts...

433
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,490
Lightning Dust wasn't
who I thought she was.

434
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,893
She didn't care about me being
scared or putting me in danger.

435
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:32,296
She only wanted a good show,
even if it meant I got hurt.

436
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,200
That's not the kind of
pony I wanna look up to.

437
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,502
          I'm the one who should
          be apologizing...

438
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,039
  for not acting like somepony
  who deserves a fan club.

439
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,774
          I've been lucky enough
          to have somepony

440
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,476
                  who thinks I'm
                  the coolest,

441
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,912
      but there's nothing cool
      about making you feel like

442
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,448
               you'll never be
               as awesome as me.

443
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,885
        I think we should cancel
        the Washouts Fan Club,

444
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,990
 because I know a fan club that
 could use some new members.

445
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,958
   The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!

446
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,729
      [knock knock knock]

447
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,198
       Welcome to the
       first ever meeting

448
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,134
     of the newest fan club
       for the awesomest,

449
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:14,038
  previously under-appreciated
   pony in Ponyville...

450
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,740
    with founding member and
     president Rainbow Dash

451
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:20,678
      presiding, it's the...
      Scootaloo Fan Club!

452
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,282
      [cheers and shouts]

453
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,484
       You know, Rainbow
        Dash was right.

454
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:29,387
   Eavesdropping on your own
  fan club isn't weird at all.
