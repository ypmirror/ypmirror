1
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:03,835
      Pinkie Pie: Oh, wow!

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:04,936
          Oh, my gosh!

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,440
    Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
    Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

4
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:11,276
    Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,544
        Sorry, Applejack!

6
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,950
             Twilight! Twilight,
               where are you?!

7
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,484
I'm in here, Pinkie.

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,284
What is it?

9
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:22,588
              You'll never guess
               what I just got!

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,788
        Is everything OK?

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,658
    We heard a lot of "Oh, my
  gosh-in'" and we weren't sure

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,193
     if it was a good thing
         or a bad thing.

13
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,961
          A good thing!

14
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,265
"To Pink Pony who lives
with baked goods."

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,967
It's from the yaks!

16
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,404
"Yaks cordially invite Pink
Pony to Yikslerbertfest."

17
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,873
    "Come. NOW!"

18
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,875
 Prince Rutherford is officially
 inviting me to Yikslerbertfest

19
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,444
                 in Yakyakistan!

20
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,147
        What is "Yikslerbertfest"?

21
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,215
It's a sacred
Yak holiday.

22
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,618
How did you get Prince
Rutherford to invite you?

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,788
     I subtly hinted for an
invitation in my letters to him.

24
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:00,392
       <i> May I please come</i>
      <i> to Yikslerbertfest?</i>

25
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,526
         <i> Pretty please?</i>

26
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:02,826
         <i> Pretty please!</i>

27
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,827
         <i> Pretty please!</i>

28
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:05,364
      <i> Pretty, pretty, pretty,</i>
     <i> pretty, pretty please!</i>

29
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,868
  After my seventeenth scroll,
      I think he picked up

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,503
    what I was putting down.

31
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,438
        Hee hee hee hee!

32
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,551
You know, we still don't
know a lot about the yaks.

33
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:02,221
So I think you should definitely
go to Yikslerbertfest, Pinkie.

34
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:06,258
           Fostering friendships
            is what ponies do.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,058
      I won't let you down.

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,763
It's an honor to be the Official
      Friendship Ambassador

37
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,865
          to the Yaks!

38
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,768
        Um, that's not an
       official position.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,368
                   Yet.

40
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,768
             You're the Princess
               of Friendship!

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,940
                 You can make
                  it happen!

42
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,409
OK, you got it.

43
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,879
        Ahem. You have to
        make it OFFICIAL!

44
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,516
Right. I hereby
make Pinkie Pie

45
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,918
the Official Friendship
Ambassador to the Yaks.

46
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,760
   This is <i>officially</i>  the most
    exciting day of my life!

47
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,533
Yoo-hoo, Gummy! Pay attention.

48
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,601
    We're in the middle of an
 Official Friendship Ambassador

49
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,536
         Road Trip Game.

50
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:54,806
    That's better.

51
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,376
OK, I spy with my
official friendship eye

52
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,878
something that is blue.

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,554
       [gasp] We're here!

54
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,593
     Oh, and by the way, the
    answer was "sky." I win!

55
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,765
      Yeah, I know that was
       a hard one, Gummy.

56
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,433
    You're the best Official
   Friendship Travel Companion

57
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:22,468
              ever!

58
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,475
        What is going on!?

59
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,512
          Yaks destroy!

60
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,748
          All : Yaks destroy!!

61
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,182
             Yikes!

62
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,285
        Ha ha! Pink Pony!

63
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,790
It's an honor to [crash] er..
be here, Prince!

64
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,226
[crash] Uh, did something
terrible happen?

65
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,762
  Is Yikslerbertfest canceled!?

66
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,498
    No. This Yikslerbertfest.

67
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,867
         Where yaks get
       together to stomp.

68
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,371
  Ohhhh, I didn't know that was
   part of the sacred holiday.

69
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,073
      So this angry display
         of destruction

70
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,308
   is part of the festivities.

71
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,511
   Heh. And here I thought you yaks
     were just in a bad mood.

72
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,680
   No. Stomping relaxes yaks.

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,882
             Hey ah!

74
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,787
 Yak's head never been so clear.

75
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,291
        This is AWESOME!

76
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,597
              STOP!

77
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,838
     Pink Pony better check
     self before wreck self.

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,976
   That is century-old sacred
      Yak Twig passed down

79
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,912
 from generation to generation.

80
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,847
             [Gasp!] Oh, no!

81
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,247
          I'm so sorry!

82
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,418
  I was just trying to get into
 the spirit of Yikslerbertfest.

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,287
         [whining] Maybe I can fix
              it--

84
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,392
     Ha ha ha! Yak kidding!

85
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,799
         Yak got Pink Pony good!

86
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,168
                   Horn bump!

87
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,603
                   Gah!

88
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,403
              Whew!

89
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,706
          You sure did,
       Prince Rutherford!

90
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,342
        That was a close
           one, Gummy.

91
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,644
        This trip has to
           be perfect!

92
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,880
      After all, we're not
    just visiting as friends.

93
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,884
  We're on Official Friendship
      Ambassador business.

94
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,119
          Less talking!

95
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,553
         More stomping!

96
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:26,777
Pinkie Pie: Yeah! Uh! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!

97
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,498
Now, I take Pink Pony
on Yakyakistan tour.

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,866
   Thanks, Prince Rutherford.

99
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,201
        But.. I've been to
       Yakyakistan before.

100
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,401
            Yak know.

101
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:40,339
      But thought Pink Pony
    might not recognize town

102
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,708
       since decorated for
        Yikslerbertfest.

103
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,910
          You're right!

104
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,980
   It's so different now that
     you've pointed it out. Heh, heh.

105
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,849
Oh, yaks not just have
eye for decorating.

106
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,585
   Yaks also amazing builders.

107
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,988
         [gasp] No way!

108
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,558
       I thought you hired
    professional contractors!

109
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,427
        Here, let me help
         you with that.

110
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,834
  This Ceremonial Yak Fire pit.

111
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,802
    Where yaks tell stories.

112
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,102
                    Ooh!

113
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:15,607
  I have so much to officially
tell the ponies when I get back!

114
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,977
      This Yak Eating Hut.

115
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,479
       Hut where yaks eat.

116
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,452
    Mmm, the perfect balance
       of vanilla extract.

117
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,654
   Yaks grow own vanilla bean.

118
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,122
        Nothing imported.

119
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,000
        Yak Sleeping Hut.

120
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,735
      Hut where yaks sleep.

121
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,846
         Yak Music Hut.

122
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:57,148
      Hut where yaks enjoy
        beautiful music.

123
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,053
       This is beautiful and-

124
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,422
                Sssh. Pink Pony
              ruin with talking.

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,731
      ... And that how yaks
   defeat evil and save world.

126
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,268
Pink Pony like yak story!

127
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,604
             A-ha! Yak impressed!

128
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,707
      Pink Pony can almost
        be Honorary Yak.

129
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,211
       Official Friendship
  Ambassador and Honorary Yak!?

130
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,213
        Pink Pony's title
          card is full!

131
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,615
Horn bump!

132
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,651
   Oh wait, I don't have a horn.

133
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,256
Prince Rutherford, can I
get some honorary yak horns?

134
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,025
     No. Yak horn too heavy
      for small pony head.

135
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,165
   Yikslerbertfest Stomp Time.

136
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,541
 Stomp harder, yaks extra happy!

137
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,777
    Ponies and yaks, friends!

138
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,728
Is this part of the festival?

139
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,963
               Pink Pony ask too
                many questions.

140
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,174
  Everything is buried in snow!
    What are we going to do!?

141
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,543
                  [mumbles] Yaks fine.

142
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,912
             Snow fall from
         mountains all the time.

143
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,347
          All the time?

144
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,582
     Every Yikslerbertfest.

145
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,385
OK. Avalanches like
this completely bury

146
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,954
all your homes every
Yikslerbertfest?

147
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:43,922
Really?

148
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,125
     This.. is.. big avalanche.

149
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,028
       But not a problem,
       for yaks are tough!

150
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,996
          Yaks dig through snow.

151
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,265
                Won't take long.

152
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,467
      Oh good, you have an
    emergency plan in place.

153
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,372
Here, let me help.

154
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,984
        Whoo, I'm tired!

155
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,552
     We must be almost done.

156
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,823
       There's still snow
        everywhere!?

157
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,125
              Yaks keep digging!

158
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,636
            Ohhhhhh.

159
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,238
              Yaks stop digging!

160
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,873
          Makes situation worse!

161
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,609
OK, don't worry,
Prince Rutherford.

162
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,011
I'll go back to Ponyville
and ask for help.

163
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,348
Twilight and the others will be
happy to come dig the snow away.

164
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,485
After all, many hooves
make light work!

165
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:47,652
Right, Gummy?

166
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,988
         Yaks no need pony help!

167
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,593
Oh. Well, I'm sure
   it'll be OK,

168
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,995
cause you probably
  have a plan B.

169
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,165
                Yes. Yaks wait
               for snow to melt.

170
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,467
 All this snow!?

171
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,203
It'll take a thousand
moons before it melts!

172
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,506
  Yaks known for their patience.

173
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,110
   Well.. be that as it may, in
the meantime, what will you eat?

174
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,511
Where will you sleep?

175
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,614
        Bah! Yaks can make this work.

176
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,050
        Hardship make yaks the
      strong yaks that yaks are!

177
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,887
If Pink Pony disagrees, then she
      can leave Yakyakistan

178
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,323
        and never return!

179
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,292
Ah! Er.. of course Pink Pony
agrees with you! Heheh..

180
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,795
       Hey! Let's try out
       some snow recipes!

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,667
           Snow cakes!

182
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,935
         Snow spaghetti!

183
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,470
        Snow sandwiches!

184
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:39,171
Heh, heh..

185
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,406
             Mmmmm!

186
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,274
    Yaks can make this work!

187
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:49,180
        [yawn] Yak tired.

188
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,349
 Yak retire to new Sleeping Hut.

189
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,494
             Hmph.

190
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,600
         Snow cake good!

191
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:14,671
          Mmmm.

192
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,541
Just the right balance
of cold and water!

193
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,778
                    Oh! Stop!

194
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,613
      Yak eating new Eating Hut!

195
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,353
    Psst, Prince Rutherford,
       what are we doing?

196
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,721
                 It's obvious.

197
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,423
       This New Music Hut!

198
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,525
Oh. So we're swaying to... ?

199
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,428
                   Ssshhh. Pink Pony ruin snow
                    music with talking.

200
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,403
What was yak?

201
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,238
            Yak stomach rumbles.

202
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,606
                     Yak hungry.

203
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,440
     Sshh.

204
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,276
Prince Yak will
hear yak!

205
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,045
               But snow worse
             than yak ever seen!

206
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,413
Yak know.

207
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,015
Yak hungry too.

208
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,484
    [gasp!] Gummy, did you hear that?

209
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,119
    They can't make it work.

210
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,589
       Yaks stop swaying.

211
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,757
           Music over.

212
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,326
      If Twilight and the others
        knew what was going on,

213
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,495
      they would be here to help
        in a pony's heartbeat.

214
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,296
              I have to convince
               Prince Rutherford

215
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,365
     that asking for help is OK.

216
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,566
        Will you help me, Gummy?

217
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:17,567
           Thank you!

218
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,271
     And see, asking you to
    help wasn't hard at all!

219
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,510
          Pink Pony has
       gathered you around

220
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,146
       the New Ceremonial
         Yak Firepit...

221
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,381
    ... to tell you a story.

222
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,183
     A yak tradition, right?

223
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,186
              Yay!

224
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,823
         This is a story
       about a group of...

225
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,693
         er.. goats, who live
          in the desert.

226
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,795
      There was a sandstorm
    and their entire village

227
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,597
       was buried in sand.

228
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,500
There was nothing they could do.

229
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:53,171
They knew they could not survive
   on only eating sand-wiches!

230
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:54,573
             Get it?

231
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:57,776
               OK.

232
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:01,980
   Anyway, finally, the goat's
       brave, wise leader

233
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,451
        --let's just call
    him Prince er.. Drutherford-- heh, heh

234
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,087
   decides that they couldn't
      do it by themselves.

235
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,423
   So he asked the neighboring
     town of uh, Bovineville

236
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,226
 to come help them. Yeah! Cows!

237
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,526
        The magical cows
        helped the goats.

238
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,530
      Everyone survived and
    lived happily ever after.

239
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,401
  Because they asked for help.

240
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:23,668
            The end!

241
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,240
         So what is the
      moral of that story?

242
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,043
       Is it A: asking for
           help is OK?

243
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,313
       B: asking for help
         saves the day?

244
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,484
      Or C: asking for help
     is good for everypony!?

245
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,619
D: goats weak
and horrible!

246
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,556
Magic Bovines need to stay
out of goats' business!

247
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,826
                Um... not quite.

248
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,695
             Any-yak wanna shout
             out another answer?

249
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,169
                 Pinkie: Hey,
              Prince Rutherford.

250
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:03,708
   I want to talk to you about
something -- what are you doing?

251
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,512
Eh.. Yak snow bed got a
little melty last night.

252
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,447
                OK, yeah.

253
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,282
       That's what I want
      to talk to you about.

254
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,919
You know, these yak snow
beds are the fluffiest

255
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:15,954
I've ever slept in!

256
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,054
They're so comfortable,

257
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,157
you forget that it's just
a cold block of ice.

258
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,960
And the yak snow
sandwiches, mmm, mmm!

259
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,995
I hate it when food
burns your mouth

260
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,497
or overwhelms
it with flavor.

261
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,366
         Oh! Yak hates that too!

262
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,035
You know who would
really, really enjoy

263
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,237
these snow sandwiches?

264
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,806
Twilight Sparkle and
the other ponies!

265
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,276
Oh! Hey, I have an idea!

266
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,279
   Why don't I go to Ponyville
    and bring them back here?

267
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,848
   Ponies like snow sandwich?

268
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,517
Oh! Ponies love snow
   sandwiches!

269
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,086
And, hey, while they're here,

270
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,954
you can ask if they'll
clear the snow away.

271
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,090
Fun, right?

272
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,325
   When Prince was little yak,

273
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,828
        Prince stomped on
        ground too hard.

274
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,664
       Made deep hole and
         fell into hole.

275
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,866
      Ice froze over hole.

276
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:06,237
   Prince waved to friends and
 family from inside frozen hole.

277
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,106
     Waited for spring thaw.

278
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,741
     Prince survived on own.

279
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,143
Wait a minute..

280
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,679
You spent the whole
 winter in a hole?

281
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,482
       Yes. And yak never
          ask for help!

282
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,953
  OK, first of all, how did you
      make such a deep hole

283
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:23,688
         from stomping?

284
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,590
         And how did it
      freeze over so fast?

285
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,492
      And how could you see
     your family and friends

286
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,260
      to wave to them from
      inside a frozen hole?

287
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,496
 Even if all that was possible,
  how did you breathe in there!?

288
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:35,733
        YAKS DON'T ASK FOR HELP!

289
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,669
    But the yaks are hungry!

290
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,638
       And who knows when
       the snow will melt?

291
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,438
          I just don't
        understand why--

292
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,412
 Ah yes, is clear now that Pink
 Pony does not understand Yaks!

293
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,381
 Honorary Yak status rescinded!

294
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,318
            Bang! Pretend there
                 is door!

295
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
              I just slammed it!

296
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,390
Fine, be stubborn!

297
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,999
   Oooh! Those yaks are so stubborn!

298
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,501
   They refuse to ask for help
    even though they need it.

299
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,503
       Well, this Official
      Friendship Ambassador

300
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,905
    is going to take matters
      into her own hooves.

301
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,240
         I'll show them.

302
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,144
You're right, Gummy.

303
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,444
I am too worked up.

304
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:24,182
A road trip game would
officially calm me down.

305
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,682
    I know!

306
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,952
Let's play "Twenty
Million Questions."

307
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,052
You think of something.

308
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,788
Then I'll ask you twenty
million questions

309
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,957
until I can come up with
what you're thinking of.

310
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,125
          Let's go!

311
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:34,892
           Is it blue?

312
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,593
          Is it green?

313
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,294
           Is it red?

314
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,095
       Is it greenish-red?

315
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:37,995
       Is it reddish-blue?

316
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,395
 Is it bigger than a bread box?

317
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:40,595
 Is it smaller than a bread box?

318
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:41,599
       Is it a bread box?

319
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:42,400
          Is it bread?

320
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,300
          Is it teeth?

321
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,969
 Is it Granny Smith's dentures?

322
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,204
           Is it you?

323
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,371
        Is it a rooster?

324
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,373
      Is it a red rooster?

325
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,175
Is it a red rooster eating corn?

326
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,111
Uhp, used up all twenty
million questions.

327
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,679
Oh, well, we're here anyway!

328
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,185
          Official Pony
       Balloon still here?

329
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:06,891
   Pink Pony gone because Pink
    Pony not tough like yaks.

330
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,694
     Horn bump in agreement.

331
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:10,695
              Now!

332
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:16,967
             Bleagh!

333
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,103
   Snow sandwich lose novelty.

334
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,038
    Snow couscous for dinner.

335
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,876
     Then Prince Rutherford
          said -- Bang!

336
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,545
     Pretend there is door!

337
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,013
       I just slammed it!

338
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,213
          Pinkie Pie--

339
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,549
So then Pink
Pony said --

340
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,518
       Fine, be stubborn!

341
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,254
       Pinkie Pie, we have
        to help the yaks!

342
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:40,091
      So in conclusion, we
     have to help the yaks!

343
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,059
    Hmm?

344
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,027
           Just go with it, hon.

345
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,895
Great idea, Pinkie.

346
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,597
We'll be happy to
 help the yaks.

347
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,833
This is what friendship
     is all about.

348
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,835
                 Hey! I'll bring
                     apples.

349
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,404
             This season's batch
              are extra juicy.

350
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,972
  And I shall provide the yaks

351
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,208
                with Equestria's
                finest textiles.

352
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,077
          They'll be silky and
         warm with hints of gold

353
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,512
      to compliment their horns.

354
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,313
                           Stop!

355
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,149
       We can't bring the
      yaks any pony stuff!

356
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,384
                       Why not?

357
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,586
The yaks are very proud.

358
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,488
They won't ask for help.

359
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,357
You know what they say, you
can lead a yak to water,

360
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,560
but you better not let
him know you're doing it!

361
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,395
Nopony says that.

362
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,597
    Do they?

363
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,399
    OK then, this will be an

364
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,401
         Official Covert
       Friendship Mission.

365
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:25,025
Rainbow Dash: You got it!
Pinkie Pie: Woohoo!

366
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:26,804
      Pinkie: Is it yellow?

367
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:27,938
          Is it slimy?

368
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,138
       Is it slimy-yellow?

369
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,141
       Rainbow Dash: We're
        not playing that!

370
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:37,181
        First, we have to
  infiltrate the yak compound!

371
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,285
      These walls are high.

372
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,788
  Sneaking in will not be easy.

373
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,365
Or it's super easy
cause I'm awesome.

374
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,501
                  Go ahead. I'll
                     catch up!

375
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,437
                 You all know
                  what to do!

376
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,523
               Oh!

377
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,658
         What happened!?

378
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,559
Snow melted.

379
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,295
Prince Rutherford was right!

380
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,935
           Aha! Yaks tough!

381
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,704
      Yaks wait patiently.

382
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,372
            Yaks win!

383
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:16,280
    Whoo-weee, helping to fix
      an entire yak village

384
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,949
  sure takes a lot out of you.

385
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,550
Let's get out of here
before--

386
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,419
       Prince: Oh Pink Pony!

387
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,090
       Just play it cool...

388
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,127
       We didn't help fix
       Yakyakistan! No no!

389
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,727
 We're just here for
the snow sandwiches!

390
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,998
  But.. then we got here and the
    snow's gone so we thought

391
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,301
   we'd hit a diner on the way
   back to Ponyville. Buh Bye!

392
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,537
               Wait! Yak not mad
                 at Pink Pony.

393
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,005
    Yak not?

394
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,242
      Pink Pony helped yaks
      without yaks asking.

395
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,844
Means Pink Pony understand yaks.

396
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,779
              I do?

397
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,915
           Hunh! I do!

398
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:54,385
              Pink Pony the best
                kind of friend.

399
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,088
        Officially Honorary Yak!

400
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,556
                         Hooray!

401
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,490
              Yay!

402
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,791
         Pink Pony Honorary Yak!

403
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,260
  Yippeeee!

404
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,129
My own Honorary Yak Horns!

405
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,965
Now I can officially horn bump!

406
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:08,966
     [thunk] Oh!

407
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:15,306
 Yeah, you know this<i> is</i> a little
  heavy for my small pony head.

408
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,607
            Ha ha ha.

409
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,776
       Need some help with
        that, Pinkie Pie?

410
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:22,481
Pink Pony no need
Apple Pony's help!

411
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,015
Just kidding!

412
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:27,952
Pink Pony got Apple Pony good!

413
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,156
Seriously, this is
  heavy. [thud]
