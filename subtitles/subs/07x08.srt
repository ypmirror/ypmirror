1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:06,070
        Hey, Apple Bloom!

2
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:09,275
   Rarity's re-organizing her
  shop and look what she found!

3
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,277
        Old costumes from
        the talent show!

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,015
 We thought they'd come in handy

5
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,917
      in case we ever help
      a pony put on a play

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,619
     or need to make a quick
   escape disguised as clowns!

7
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:25,857
      Here you go, Big Mac.

8
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,769
              Whoa! That sure is
               a lot of apples!

9
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,564
 Are you making another delivery
   to Starlight's old village?

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,698
             Eee-yup.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,736
    That's an awful long way
   for a pony to go, isn't it?

12
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:37,936
             Eee-yup.

13
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,736
        You've been going
       there a lot lately.

14
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:41,508
       What is this? Your
      fifth trip this week?

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,244
             Eee-yup.

16
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,946
       OK, well, have fun!

17
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,815
   So what other costumes did
    you bring, Sweetie Belle?

18
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,515
         Are you crazy!?

19
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:54,417
  We can't talk about costumes
      at a time like this!

20
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:55,888
         Time like what?

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,724
         Your brother is
        hiding something.

22
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,160
         Did you see the
       way he was acting?

23
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,963
    Yeah, he totally blushed
       when you brought up

24
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,265
    how often he's been going
   to Starlight's old village.

25
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,268
          Something is
      definitely going on.

26
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,170
  There can only be one reason

27
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,640
       a pony would travel
        so far, so often.

28
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,841
      Scootaloo: He's taking private skiing lessons!
      Apple Bloom: I've been cooking a lot of broccoli-
      Sweetie Belle: He's training for a marathon!

29
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,846
     -and he wants to get
     away from the smell!

30
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:09,061
Maybe he's a spy on a mission
to thwart an evil villain

31
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,362
     with his secret weapon:

32
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,164
an apple cannon!

33
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:16,302
    No, that's crazy. I think
     it's my broccoli thing.

34
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,004
               Why don't we just
                   ask him?

35
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,040
      You saw how shifty he
       was acting earlier.

36
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,442
      There's no way he'll
    tell us what he's doing.

37
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,211
Plus, I really want
 to go undercover.

38
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,847
  We already
have costumes.

39
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,284
   Call me: Agent Rainbowhead.

40
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,020
 I'll be Shimmering Spectacles:

41
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,558
        a librarian with
       a mysterious past.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,994
      And I'll be a pirate
      spy. Argh. A spyrate!

43
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,469
Avast! Our ship be leaving port!

44
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,669
              Huh?

45
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,805
Big Mac's leaving.

46
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,276
If we're gonna be
spies, we gotta go NOW!

47
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,589
        Big Mac's comin'!
     Quick, act like apples!

48
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,157
                      What? How?

49
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,641
Who's that pony?

50
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,010
                     Let me see!

51
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,916
        I don't know. Shouldn't
      have taken the binoculars.

52
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,868
                   I don't know
                   anypony here.

53
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,487
That must be
Sugar Belle.

54
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,655
Applejack told me
about her bakery.

55
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,258
Obviously, she's just been
ordering a lot of apples.

56
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,232
       So nothing fishy's
            going on.

57
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,502
         No way! We came
        here to be spies!

58
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,872
   And no spy I know has ever
    solved a case that quick.

59
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,174
         Um..how many spies
          do you know?

60
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,043
           That's.. not important.

61
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,047
       What's important is
     that we do more recon!

62
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,348
         Follow my lead.

63
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,561
Whoa, she sure likes her apples!

64
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:26,499
  What is she doing? Making the
 biggest apple pie in Equestria?

65
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,735
           Thanks for coming all
            this way, Big Mac.

66
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,374
          It sure is nice seeing
            you again so soon.

67
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:39,413
             Eee-yup.

68
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,116
     All I used to bake were
       boring old muffins.

69
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,185
       But thanks to your
        apple deliveries,

70
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,654
     I get to bake all kinds
      of delicious treats!

71
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,690
      ... apple pies, apple
   fritters, apple turnovers,

72
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,526
         caramel apples,
     caramel apple cakes...

73
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,778
     I just wish I had more
     room to display it all.

74
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,433
  My shelves only hold so much.

75
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:06,005
   I'm telling you, this pony
    reaaaally likes her apples!

76
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,957
      Or Big Mac!

77
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:09,741
               Huh?

78
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:10,976
           Just look!

79
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,811
           Ooh! Uh!

80
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,918
        Sweetie Belle, I
       think you're right!

81
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,220
 I think my brother has a crush!

82
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,087
             Shhhh!

83
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,727
         Psst! Big Mac!

84
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,499
        Now remember, my
       brother's super shy

85
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,369
  so he's probably going to be
  embarrassed about his crush.

86
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,338
        Just try and make
      him feel comfortable.

87
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,709
       Hey, Big Mac! It's
        me: Apple Bloom!

88
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,377
             Eee-yup.

89
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,779
We're here, too!

90
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,247
             Mm hm.

91
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,151
     I'm going to ask you a
     very personal question

92
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:55,020
        and I want you to
        answer honestly.

93
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:01,160
    Do you... have a crush
       on... Sugar Belle?

94
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:02,595
             Eee-yup.

95
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,463
Well, that was easy!

96
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,898
      This is so exciting!

97
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,767
       My big brother has
      his very first crush!

98
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,770
        First crush? What
        about Cheerilee?

99
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,039
It doesn't really count
when you trick a pony

100
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,475
into drinking a love
potion, does it?

101
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,643
                       Nope.

102
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:21,246
    My brother has a crush!
    My brother has a crush!

103
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,249
    My brother has a crush!

104
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,118
     Wait. Does Sugar Belle
     even know you like her?

105
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,119
             Nuh uh.

106
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,321
                  Then you gotta
                     tell her!

107
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,124
             Ehh....

108
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,259
We're pretty sure
she likes you!

109
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,161
I mean, she keeps
ordering apples

110
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,596
just so she can
see you again!

111
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,398
          Ya think so?

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,835
Totally. But you'll never
know if you don't try!

113
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:44,803
               OK.

114
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,607
Go get 'er, Big Mac!

115
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,124
     Hey girl. I was writing
       poetry by the pond

116
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,626
    when I saw these flowers.

117
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,962
     I thought I'd show them
       how pretty you are.

118
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,764
                    Oh. Thanks,
                  Feather Bangs!

119
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,241
      Um, is it possible to
    have two crushes at once?

120
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:26,111
    Because it looks like Big
  Mac may not be the only pony

121
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,646
       Sugar Belle likes!

122
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,922
 Hey, Big Mac! Where you goin'?

123
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,222
              Home.

124
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,359
   You can't let that Feather
      fella get in the way

125
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,693
     of your one true love.

126
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,528
   You've gotta take him down!

127
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,530
 What can he do that you can't?

128
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,230
                    That!

129
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,534
      Whoops! Ha ha. These
       balls are like you.

130
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,970
        I'll always catch
        you if you fall.

131
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,342
  Seriously? That line worked?

132
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,444
           She'll never pick me.

133
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,414
      Sure she will, cause
      we're gonna help you!

134
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,616
        No love potions!

135
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,590
Don't worry, Big Mac. We learned
    our lesson the hard way.

136
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,359
        Yeah, we're never
      gonna do that again.

137
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,428
         Besides, I know
       exactly what to do!

138
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,598
      When I was younger I
    read all the fairy tales.

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,666
                   When you were
                   younger, huh?

140
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,504
Well.. I was younger
on the way here.

141
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,139
It was a long ride!

142
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,142
Anyway, as long as we
do what the book says,

143
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,277
you're pretty much
guaranteed a happy ending!

144
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,046
      How 'bout this one?!

145
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:40,252
    Rescuing a damsel pony in
    distress. That's perfect.

146
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,322
    Of course, we'll have to
   improvise without a dragon.

147
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,858
Too bad Spike isn't here. Not
that he's very threatening.

148
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,962
           So what should we do?

149
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,914
           Wait around for Sugar
           Belle to get herself

150
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,334
         into a scary situation?

151
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:58,003
 OR we bring the danger to her!

152
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,745
     All right, Scootaloo's
      gonna pretend to take

153
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:10,615
 Sugar Belle's things, then you
  swoop in and stop her. Ready?

154
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:13,219
              Nope.

155
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,888
C'mon, you're gonna be her hero!

156
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,458
       In fairy tales, the
     knight in shining armor

157
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,992
      always gets the girl.

158
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:23,516
Uh-huh

159
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,139
         Oh! Somepony help!

160
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:53,358
Here's your sugar, Sugar. Though
   it is not as sweet... as you.

161
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,898
Thank you, Feather!

162
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,303
       That smooth-talking
     pony stole our rescue!

163
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,937
         And it totally
       would have worked!

164
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,039
             Eeyup!

165
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,108
        We're just gonna
      have to keep trying!

166
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,110
          Big Mac, are you ready
          to take it up a notch?

167
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,845
           Oh, Eeyup!

168
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,916
            Oh, Nope.

169
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:21,019
    Trust us. There's nothing
    more romantic than waking

170
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,921
        your special pony
      from a sleeping spell

171
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,423
      with a magical kiss!

172
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,360
       See? They rode off
        into the sunset.

173
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,197
   Any sign of Feather Bangs?

174
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,304
    Negative. Coast is clear!

175
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,407
   It's now or never, Big Mac!

176
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,361
               Ah!

177
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,698
      Oh, girl, you've been
      workin' hard all day.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,802
      Allow me to treat you
   like the princess, heh heh, you are!

179
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:20,178
  Hey! That's our metaphorical
 sunset they're riding off into!

180
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,048
All right. This ends now!

181
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,450
Feather Bangs may
have good timing.

182
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:29,555
And a good mane. But let's
see him compete with a song!

183
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,523
         Say what now?!

184
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,726
      Of course! Why didn't
     we think of it before?

185
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,697
  Every great love story hinges
 on the romantic musical number!

186
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,033
   Big Mac, you've gotta write
     a song for Sugar Belle!

187
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,402
Ee-yup!

188
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,377
        Come on, Big Mac!

189
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,048
        Feather Bangs is
           so romantic

190
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,651
    When he speaks, I pretend
       he's talking to me.

191
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,257
 Come on! You can do better than
  him! Just like we practiced.

      What in Equestria has

242
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,203
                If you think I'm
                the kind of pony

243
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,705
                  that likes all
                  this nonsense,

244
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,442
             then you clearly
           don't know me at all!

245
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,779
     I wish everypony would
      just LEAVE ME ALONE!

246
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,135
            Big Mac!

247
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,140
            Big Mac!

248
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,043
        Well, nopony's seen him.

249
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:23,248
I feel terrible. I've never seen
   my brother so upset before.

250
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,717
        BIG MAC! Big Mac!

251
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,457
                  Are you OK?

252
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,659
          Nope.

253
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,762
      Sorry it didn't work
      out with Sugar Belle.

254
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,297
        We don't get it.

255
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,467
   Big, grand gestures always
    work in the fairy tales!

256
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,137
      But Sugar Belle's not
     a fairy tale princess;

257
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,039
       she's a real pony.

258
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,575
  She's kind and she works hard

259
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,077
     and she's sweeter than
    everything in her bakery.

260
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,349
      That's it! We should
    have been thinking about

261
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,585
        what would mean a
       lot to Sugar Belle!

262
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:01,853
              Hmmm.

263
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:07,325
   I know just the thing! But
    I'm gonna need your help.

264
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,195
Really? Even after
we messed it up?

265
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,030
                  Eee-yup!

266
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:12,831
C'mon!

267
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:27,545
Hello! My name's

268
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:32,017

with a mysterious past.

269
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,089
       Oh. OK. I'm--wait a
   minute. You look familiar.

270
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:45,063
  I shouldn't. Um... I'm new in
  town. Mind showing me around?

271
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,231
            Uh, sure.

272
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,401
     That's the whole town.
    It's just the one street.

273
00:17:56,176 --> 00:18:01,412
    Oh, no, clumsy me! Here,
  let me help you clean it up!

274
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,250
   I don't think Scootaloo can
    hold her off much longer!

275
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,022
        Uh... now hold on
            a minute.

276
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,826
         Are you sure I
    can't buy you a new bag?

277
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,528
   I'm good. It's no big deal.

278
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,330
          But... uh... um...

279
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,039
            OK, what's going on?

280
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,876
 The cupcake has landed! Repeat!
     The cupcake has landed!

281
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,747
            Big Mac!

282
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,054
 You made me a new display case?

283
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,789
                   Eee-yup...

284
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,293
And you made it bigger!
You remembered!

285
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,030
    Now I have twice as much
    room for all my desserts.

286
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:55,534
           Which means...
      I can make even more!

287
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,504
  I've been dying to try baking
   cream pies and whoopie pies

288
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:03,675
     and icebox cakes and of
   course, more apple treats.

289
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,579
Oh, Big Mac, thank
you so much.

290
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,783
This is the sweetest thing
anypony's ever done for me.

291
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:17,556
  Ummm... yee-- nooope... uh...

292
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,158
           I like you, too.

293
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,663
           Awwwwwwww!

294
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,066
        That was the most
      romantic thing ever!

295
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:32,704
        Wait a minute...
       I recognize you fillies!

296
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,173
       Have they been with
      you this whole time?

297
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,242
I'm Big Mac's little sister.

298
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,011
And these are my friends.

299
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,413
   We're sorry for everything
    we put you through today,

300
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,213
          Sugar Belle.

301
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,484
 Big Mac never would have gone
through with all of those crazy

302
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:47,718
Over-the-top...

303
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,618
     Downright ridiculous...

304
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,490
   attempts to impress you if
   we hadn't put him up to it.

305
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,526
   But we learned our lesson!

306
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,595
       Romance isn't about
      impressing somepony;

307
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,565
   it's about doing something
  that means something special

308
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,502
      to that pony you lo--
               like a lot.

309
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,472
Uh, Apple Bloom? I
think they get it.

310
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:23,523
     <i> ♪ Sugar Belle!! Whoa!</i>
       <i> Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! ♪</i>

311
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:24,724
     <i> ♪ Yeah..  ♪</i>

312
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,260
Sorry, Feather. You're
a little too late.

313
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,697
   Yeah, Sugar Belle's already
  picked her special somepony.

314
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,467
But don't worry.

315
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,938
You've got three not-so-secret
admirers right behind you!

316
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:46,386
Heh, heh..

317
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:48,046
   What should I say to them?

318
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,715
Uh. You're asking us for advice?

319
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,886
 Uh huh. Look, I can mane-flip,
    write poetry and juggle,

320
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,855
 but actually talking to a pony?

321
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,858
       It scares me almost
     as much as loneliness.

322
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,027
    Will you help me? Please?

323
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,763
  Gee, I don't know about this.

324
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:09,033
He just needs a little nudge in
 the conversation department!

325
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,870
    Besides, I don't think Big
  Mac's ready to leave just yet.

326
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,009
                    Let's do it!

327
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:23,013
  Feather Bangs, the Cutie Mark
 Crusaders are AT YOUR SERVICE!
