1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:06,105
 I think you really spruce up
 the office, Ms. Philodendron.

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,441
               Oh! I'm going to
               call you Phyllis!

3
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,709
         [funny voice] Don't you
         look good, Phyllis.

4
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,145
     [same funny voice] Come in!

5
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,681
   [cough]     
 [normal voice]
 I mean, uh, come in!

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,450
Uh, were you just
talking to someone?

7
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,119
            No. Why? Heh.

8
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,622
Starlight, I have something very
important to discuss with you.

9
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,424
           If this is about
        leaving early yesterday,

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,259
            I didn't have any
         students on my schedule

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,161
          and Trixie was having
          a "magical emergency,"

12
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,562
           which actually turned
            out to be nothing.

13
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:32,965
               It's not anything
               like that!

14
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:35,501
         Ahem!

15
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:37,870
    Twilight Sparkle, the
    Princess of Friendship,

16
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,405
        in light of her
      impending ascension

17
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:42,241
   to the throne of Equestria
     and in anticipation

18
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:45,277
  of her many duties and
  responsibilities forthwith,

19
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,113
       does hereby intend
       to make good

20
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:50,349
    on her previous offer to
    you, Starlight Glimmer,

21
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:54,687
  of replacing her as Headmare
  of the School of Friendship!

22
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,356
  I want you to take over the
school when I move to Canterlot.

23
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,490
                 I KNOW!

24
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,726
           It's just so.. amazing!

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,794
        I'm a little...

26
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,429
       Do you think I'm
       really up for it?

27
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:04,330
       Of course you do.

28
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,199
   I've covered for you every
   time you've had to run off

29
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,068
      and save Equestria,
      but, I mean, yes!

30
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,669
           Of course!
           Thank You!

31
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:14,740
     You're welcome.

32
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:18,143
 And I can't think of any pony
 who'd be better for the job.

33
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,013
           I'm a little nervous,
           and excited,

34
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,448
                 I'm mostly just
                  nervous.

35
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,549
I understand.

36
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,818
Of course I'll have a lot of
important responsibilities

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,687
as ruler of Equestria, but
I'll always be available

38
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,422
to help whenever
you need.

39

               with Celestia and
               Luna right now?

41
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,498
Right! Can't underestimate the
important responsibility

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,367
of Royal napkin
placement..!

43
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,271
              Wow.

44
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:47,940
       I mean, no biggie,
       right Phyllis?

45
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,375
     I've totally got this.

47

You know I'm nothing but
proud that you've been

48
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,488
officially offered the
position of Headmare.

49
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,690
           [tentatively] Thanks...

50
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,992
But, I can't
help wondering

51
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,594
if it's going to cut into
our social schedule.

52
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,029
               What do you mean?

53
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,965
Take now,
for example.

54
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:49,034
Instead of heading to the
delightful lunch I had planned,

55
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,437
we're striding with
determination toward

56
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,173
what I can only assume
is Twilight's office.

57
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:57,109
            Obviously, our lunch
            is super important,

58
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,044
                but so is taking
                over the school

59
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,780
 and the only pony who's really
 <i>run</i> the School of Friendship

60
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,949
           is the <i>Princess</i>
           of Friendship.

61
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,951
           And I'm worried about
           doing it all alone,

62
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,187
        so I want to get as much
        advice from Twilight

63
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,122
               as I can while
               she's still here.

64
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,459
But Twilight's never
really done anything alone.

65
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,128
She always has
her friends.

66
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,596
                But that just
                gave me an idea!

67
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,664
                 Thanks, Trixie!

68
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,666
        You can give good advice
        when you don't mean to.

69
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,234
Uh, thanks?

70
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,503
   Are we still doing lunch?

      Settings just right

73
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,678
        is a lot harder
        than it looks.

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,014
OK, umm..

75
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:37,749
I know how busy you are, but
I wanted to talk to you

76
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,319
about running the school
because, honestly,

77
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,122
I was a bit worried about
taking it over all on my own,

78
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,392
but I just realized
YOU never did it alone.

79

            Having a friend help
            out <i>is</i> pretty great.

80
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,264
Exactly!

81
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,935
So, what do you think about me
hiring a <i>Vice</i>-Headmare

82
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,370
to help run things?

83

     I trust you to run the
    school any way you want.

84
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,908
    And if that means
    hiring a Vice-Headmare,

85
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,676
   I think it's a great idea.

86
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,578
            Really!?

87
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,547
      Like you said, I've always
      had ponies around to help.

88
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,616

        always call on me to--

Uh, Twilight?

90
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:13,453
 Rarity says you were supposed
 to be at the boutique

91
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:16,288
five minutes ago for your second
fitting for the coronation gown.

92
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,690
          Ugh. How many fittings are
          there going to be?

93
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,459
             A lot?

94
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,295
   Anyway, good luck finding
   your Vice-Headmare.

    I know you'll pick the
    right pony for the job.

Wow. I heard the
whole thing

97
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,338

is, I am humbled.

00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,174
                   Uh, why?

99
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,775
I hadn't ever
considered it,

100
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,810
but hearing you say it
out loud made me realize

101
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,813
what a great and powerful
Vice-Headmare I'll be!

102
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,651
Plus, we get to work <i>and</i>
socialize at the same time!

103
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,953
          Oh. Well, sure, that
          would be fun, but

104
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,922
            I can't just
            <i>give</i> you the job.

105
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,491
    Oh, oh, no. Of
     course not..

106
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,461
I imagine there's a lengthy
"process" to go through

107
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:59,631
before you inevitably hire the
"best pony" for the position.

108
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,666
    Wink!

109
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,700
                    Exactly..

110
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,436
I'll probably
interview several ponies..

111
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,740
Of course.
"Several." Wink.

112
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,109
                 Why do you keep
                 saying wink?

113
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,677
I'm not saying wink!

114
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,978
     Wink.

115
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,783
  I'm glad you all decided to
  be part of the search

116
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,552
     for the School of
  Friendship's Vice-Headmare.

117
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,755
  Honestly, if you're looking
  for somepony to fundraise,

118
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,224
         I can bring in
         enough bits

119
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,827
   to have several buildings
   named after me.

120
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,929
     Well, that's not the
     <i>primary</i> responsibility

121
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,164
     of the Vice-Headmare,

122
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,766
      but anypony
      is welcome to apply!

123
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,735
    I think the selection
   process I've come up with

124
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,604
       is pretty special.

125
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,440
      [loud whisper]
      Albeit unnecessary.

126
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,308
             Wink!

127
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,743
             Ahem.

128
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:47,246
  Since you ALL have to prove
  you have what it takes to be

129
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:51,183
 Vice-Headmare, I've designed
 the interview in three stages.

130
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,820
Each stage will test a different
 skill the Vice-Headmare needs.

131
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,856
  Only those who do WELL will
  move through the stages

132
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,360
  until finally the best
  candidate rises to the top!

133
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,430
    So, without further ado,
    it's time for stage one:

134
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,332
        Substituting for
        the teachers!

135
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,271
               Once the students
               get a sample

136
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,873
           of my great and
           powerful instruction,

137

 A lifetime on stage has taught
 me that good communication

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,088
  is essential to holding your
  audience's attention,

202
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,791

      as a great and
     powerful communicator!

204
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,800
    Life at the School of
   Friendship is like a song,

00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,555
   If fostered, I believe she
   could easily blaze a trail

212
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,391

  You're saying

But aren't

       And are they good?

232
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,440
  I mean, you could be trying
  to tell me she's unfocused,

233
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,509
       but then you might
       just be explaining

234
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,410
      that you appreciate
       her high energy.

             Maybe?

237
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,718
There seems to be a lot of
nuance here and I just want to

238
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,854
make sure I understand

242
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,763

You went from not taking it
seriously to blowing things

so out of proportion, you put
every creature in danger!

that you would ever help me!

       figuring out what.

  What if you and your
  friend can't figure it out?

373
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,753
If you have a job to do, you
have to decide what's best

374
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,989
and be upfront and honest,
even if that means

375
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,124
you can't work with
a friend on it.

376

 to them at the beginning

instead of stringing them along
until you get so frustrated

378
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,635

 bunch of really awful things?

00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,135
            and detail-oriented,
            like Twilight.

413
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:08,539
        And smart, obviously, it
        is a school after all.

414
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,808
It would be nice if I
got along with them,

415
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,278
since having it be a
friend can't work out.

416
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,312
                 Maybe it can!

417
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,118
    ...and I knew as soon as
     I read Trixie's scroll

418
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,554
  that it was the exact right
  thing for me to do.

419
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,324
   But what about being
   Flurry Heart's Crystaler?

420
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,060
 Well, honestly, now that
 Flurry Heart's a little older,

421
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,695
there really isn't
much for me to do

422
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,131
outside of the occasional
tradition or festival.

423
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,000
And working at a school is what
I always thought I'd do,

424
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,135
I mean, if you'll have me..

425
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,603
                Are you kidding!?

426
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,705
                   You're hired!

427
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,607
            I had a feeling
            this would work out.

428
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,943
       Oh, Trixie, thank
       you so much!

429
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,445
    Between being insightful
     when I want to be

430
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,615
          and giving good advice
           when I don't mean to,

431
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,117
            I suppose I can be a
            pretty good friend.

432
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,053
More than that, actually.

433
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,155
       You really did
       give good advice,

434
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,923
     and you helped me talk
      through the problem

435
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,891
      of finding the right
       pony for the job.

436
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,094
      And we know you care
      about the students..

437
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:06,330
          Trixie the Great and
          Powerful Advice Giver,

438
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,534
       Problem Talk Througher,
       and Student Care Abouter!

439
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,702
                 Eh. I think I'll go
                 with friend.

440
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,040
Friend is perfect, but.. there's a
position here at the school

441
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,109
you might be
right for too..

442
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,544
What would you say to being
the School of Friendship's

443
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,646
NEW student counselor?

444
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,585
   I'd say, this office needs
   a bit of redecorating!

445
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,254
               Potted plants
             scream desperation..

446
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,656
          Phyllis! No!
