1
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:10,542
 Oops! Sorry, Princess Twilight!
     That was meant for her!

2
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,279
            INCOMING!

3
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:14,931
              Whoa!

4
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,886
   Toola Roola! Coconut Cream!

5
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,221
       What are you doing?

6
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,390
       That was meant for
         my ex-friend!

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,592
     I'm not your ex-friend!

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,461
      You're my ex-friend!

9
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,334
       Both of you, stop!

10
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,506
     So you see, friendship
        isn't always easy

11
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,342
      but there's no doubt
    it's worth fighting for.

12
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,177
             Awwww!

13
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,381
   Hmm. That sounds familiar.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,888
        Hmmm. No. Uh uh.

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,896
        Aha! Here it is!

16
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,699
          What is that?

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,000
       Come on, Starlight.

18
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,669
Don't judge a book by its cover.

19
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,639
 This is the friendship journal
 my friends and I used to keep.

20
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,774
    It's filled with all the
      things we've learned!

21
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,343
        Like... "friendship
        isn't always easy

22
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,779
    but there's no doubt it's
      worth fighting for."

23
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,419
I'll.. judge a book by its
cover just this once.

24
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,964
  Thanks for coming, everypony!

25
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,899
 I've got a surprise for you...

26
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,036
What is it, Twilight? Do I
need to prepare myself?

27
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,003
           It's this!

28
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,173
         Oh! What is that thing?

29
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,841
            Why is it so smelly!

30
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,577
Wait a minute!

31
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,212
       [gasp] Is this our old
       friendship journal?

32
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,181
       I haven't seen this
        thing in forever!

33
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,152
Hooo-wee, it's lookin' a
  little uh, overripe.

34
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,486
                   I'll say!

35
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,524
    There's a smooshed apple
     in Applejack's lessons.

36
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,465
   Fluttershy's lessons are so
small, you can barely read them.

37
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,568
    I.. uh.. wanted to leave
      room for all of you.

38
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,341
         I-I don't even
       know what this is.

39
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,079
        It is called
      calligraphy, darling.

40
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,515
 If you're going to make words,
  at least make them fabulous.

41
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,787
      Looks like you got a
        little aggressive

42
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,756
      with your friendship
     lessons, Rainbow Dash.

43
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,257
         What can I say?

44
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,926
     When I learn something,
        I learn it hard.

45
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,864
     I found Pinkie's page.

46
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,334
Hee hee! Well, I
am surprised!

47
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,603
    That wasn't
the only surprise..

48
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,084
           <i> ♪ Ta da! ♪</i>

49
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,121
   Starlight and I decided to
    make one for each of you!

50
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,058
That's amazin'!
A perfect copy!

51
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,560
  I learned the spell years ago
  when I needed to make copies

52
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,594
         of a certain...

53
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,599
            ...manifesto.

54
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,703
      Ah! Even better than
         a perfect copy.

55
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,839
Oh, I'd forgotten all
about this lesson.

56
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,075
Ha ha! Remember this one?

57
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,711
From when I helped Daring Do?

58
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,446
"Never underestimate
the power of friends

59
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,048
  who've always got your back."

60
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,916
Aww, Cheese Sandwich!

61
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:12,918
Party cannon!

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,720
Ah! Birthaversary!

63
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,688
After Twilight
remembered the journal,

64
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,191
I had so much fun reading all
the stuff you've all learned.

65
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,126
I just had to have
my own copy.

66
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,895
    And that brings me to the
  second part of the surprise.

67
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,963
                     My idea.

68
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,532
    How would you girls feel
    about making our journal

69
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,134
    available for everypony?

70
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,736
   If we can get these lessons
   into other ponies' hooves,

71
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,572
maybe they'll benefit from them.

72
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,241
          Well, I think
      that's a great idea.

73
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,844
          I'm in! YAY!

74
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,845
  We always said we wanted to.

75
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,481
                Sounds fabulous.

76
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,850
      Hahaha, I'm awesome.

77
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,154
Oh, yeah, uh, good idea.

78
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,591
Toola Roola: <i>No! I don't want to</i>
<i>play with you anymore!</i>

79
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,828
Why not? You love
playing hopscotch.

80
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,899
             No,<i> you</i> do. Because
               you always win!

81
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,200
          <i> Twilight: Hey, girls.</i>

82
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,601
   Couldn't help but overhear...

83
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,170
               You might want to
               take a breather,

84
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:41,072
       maybe read Rainbow Dash's
       chapter on Rainbow Falls.

85
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,074
                  It might help.

86
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,176
                 Sure, Princess.

87
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,011
Apple Bloom: <i>Thanks, Twilight!</i>

88
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,047
    The friendship journal's
    makin' us super popular!

89
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,449
              Oh...

90
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,117
       We were thinkin' of
        putting together

91
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,585
    a Cutie Mark Summer Camp.

92
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,521
   Now everypony's definitely
      gonna sign up for it!

93
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,023
  This is going to be awesome! Heh heh.

94
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,262
A Cutie Mark Camp
is a great idea.

95
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,130
           Yeah, but the purpose
              of the journal

96
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,998
               isn't supposed to
                 be marketing.

97
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,736
     I just hope those foals
    actually learn something

98
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:12,736
        from our lessons.

99
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:16,841
They will. I'm sure ponies all
across Equestria will--woah!

100
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,546
                Uh, hello.

101
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,448
Can I... help you?

102
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,417
     We're here all the way
        from Fillydelphia

103
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,886
    because we got copies of
    your friendship journal.

104
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,288
       Wow! How wonderful.

105
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,556
     What was your favorite
          friendship--

106
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,424
             Will you sign them?

107
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,094
       Oh. Uh, I guess so.

108
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,264
        So, what did you
      think of the lessons?

109
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,965
    Oh, we haven't read them.

110
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:41,865
      These are keepsakes.

111
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,302
       We gotta keep them
       in mint condition. Heh.

112
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:45,904
               Oh.

113
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,174
   Wow, that was worth the trip!

114
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,816
   Don't worry, Twilight, I'm
    sure lots of other ponies

115
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,951
      are being inspired to
       be better friends.

116
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,521
    Well, I for one found the
 journal terribly illuminating.

117
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:04,056
Ah!

118
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:05,791
            I agree.

119
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,427
    I'm seeing sides of these
ponies I didn't know were there.

120
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,929
       I only wish they'd
        left Rarity out.

121
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,532
  She clearly doesn't belong in
that book with the rest of them.

122
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,100
           Oh, I know!

123
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,768
   Who does she think she is?

124
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,837
       Certainly she did a
     fine job setting up the

125
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,205
   Ponyville Days Celebration,

126
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,073
       but does she really
    believe it was a success

127
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,174
      just because of her?

128
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,442
            Ha ha ha!

129
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,543
           The nerve!

130
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,983
But that's not what
she was saying!

131
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,117
   Rarity!

132
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,995
Oh. Poor Rarity.

133
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,931
She overheard all the mean
things those ponies were saying!

134
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,633
She must be devastated.

135
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm going after her.

136
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:49,902
                      Go ahead.

137
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,571
             I'm going to have a
            chat with these two.

138
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,210
          Rarity, wait!

139
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,154
Agh!

140
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,812
   Twilight, isn't it amazing?

141
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,814
  Our journals are everywhere!

142
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,316
Pinkie! I've got to--

143
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,617
      Ponies keep stopping
          by to tell me

144
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,552
    my entries are hilarious!

145
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,859
  I even had somepony come all
    the way from Las Pegasus

146
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,828
       to say how much he
        liked my lessons!

147
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,997
      I am so glad to hear
  someponies are being inspired

148
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:19,798
         by the journal!

149
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,834
Hey look! There's Pinkie
Pie, the funny one!

150
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,406
                Giggly feedback
               is the best kind!

151
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,744
      Well, at least you're
  getting a positive reaction.

152
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,344
I just saw Rarity.

153
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm afraid this whole journal
thing really upset her.

154
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,283
            Aww. That's too bad.

155
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,722
               Wait, that wasn't
                  even funny.

156
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,727
        OK. Well, I guess
      I'll catch you later.

157
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,667
       Yup. Bye, Twilight.

158
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:01,907
                 Ha! Classic Pinkie!

159
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,909
               Oh! She's even funnier
                 in real life!

160
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,777
You've known
me for years!

161
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,887
   Rainbow Dash: Maybe it's
     time to call it a day.

162
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,390
  I ripped out all the Twilight
         Sparkle lessons

163
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,592
   'cause they were getting in
    the way of the good ones!

164
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,428
What do you mean you
skipped the lessons?

165
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,997
We've all had
valuable experiences!

166
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,032
Hey, here's a great idea!

167
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,369
   Why don't you guys talk to
      Twilight for a while

168
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:33,538
   so I can get back to things
 like working and napping and...

169
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,608
well, pretty much anything else.

170
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,777
      Aw, we don't want to
    hear her boring lessons!

171
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,014
  Come on, tell us again about
     when you met Daring Do!

172
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,817
         Heh heh. Again?

173
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,718
              Haven't we already
               covered that one?

174
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,487
           A couple dozen times?

175
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,289
   We can't get enough of it!

176
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,991
     Come on, you don't want
    to disappoint your fans!

177
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:59,164
      Uh.. It's just that I, uh,
    really need to get those

178
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,001
        stormclouds back
         in their.... pens.

179
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:05,671
 Cool! We'll come along and you
  can tell us the story there!

180
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:10,008
   Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
     Rainbow Dash!

181
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,247
Oooh..

182
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,514
      What's going on now?

183
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,389
  Please! Just leave me alone!

184
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,157
Fluttershy? What's wrong?

185
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,193
We want answers!

186
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,895
Yeah! We're
entitled to know!

187
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,864
     What is it, everypony?

188
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,065
We want to know why
Fluttershy keeps learning

189
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,467
the same thing over
and over again.

190
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,802
Be assertive, already.

191
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,504
        Even I've learned
       more than she has!

192
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,206
   Why can't I be in the book?

193
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,843
What? Really? Are you
attacking my friend

194
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,445
because you want
to be in a book?

195
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,914
          It's OK. I've
        got this, girls.

196
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,651
         Listen up! I<i> am</i>
         more assertive.

197
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,153
       And yes, it took me
      a while to get there.

198
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,456
  But can you honestly say that
    you could learn something

199
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:59,224
     one time and completely
       change who you are?

200
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,261
              I didn't think so!

201
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:06,431
 Wow. You're way different from
   the Fluttershy in the book.

202
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,401
I don't know how
I feel about that.

203
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,109
               It feels like
          everypony in Equestria

204
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,478
 is missing the friendship part
   of the friendship journals.

205
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,250
   Rarity? Are you all right?

206
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:25,884
              Gah!

207
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,255
What are you doing?

208
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,957
        Why I'm creating
        a gown, darling!

209
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,959
For what?

210
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:34,960
          I don't know!

211
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,094
       I'm stress-sewing!

212
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:38,764
Stress-sewing?

213
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,932
     When I overheard those
        two at the cafe,

214
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,200
    I suddenly understood why

215
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,269
        I've been getting
     cancellations for days!

216
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,473
          What? Why are ponies
        cancelling their orders?

217
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,775
         Because.. nopony
        likes me anymore!

218
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,411
     They're boycotting me!

219
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,753
   I'm sure if I go out there
    and talk to those ponies,

220
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,455
    they'll see that they're
       being unreasonable.

221
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,659
    I need a hundred blankets
       and I need 'em now!

222
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:08,827
        Sorry, Twilight.

223
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,032
        Right away, Pony
       who still likes me!

224
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:14,966
   I don't need nothin' fancy.

225
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,703
  What's the matter, Applejack?

226
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,905
I'm popular, Twilight!

227
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,507
I'm popular and I
don't like it one bit!

228
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,178
  You go ahead, I'll stay here.

229
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,176
              Applejack, who are
               all these ponies?

230
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,846
    They call themselves "the
     Sweet Apple Admirers."

231
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,748
       They say they read
       my journal entries

232
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,783
      and they felt like a
       part of the family.

233
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,586
  And now they want to actually
   become part of the family!

234
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,657
      Your journal entries?

235
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,026
  Yeah, you know, all the stuff
   about how friends are like

236
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,061
       family and whatnot.

237
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,596
   Can't you get rid of them?

238
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,598
   And kick out my own family?

239
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,900
          Granny Smith!

240
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,602
      Hang on, let me help!

241
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,072
          There she is!

242
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,674
        YEEEEEE-HAAWWWW!

243
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,846
      Oh. I wish we'd never
     released that journal.

244
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:42,753
         There you are.

245
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,124
    OK. I just left Rarity; I
    think she's doing better and-

246
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:47,826
            Oh, boy.

247
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,561
      Window staring, huh?

248
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,830
       Was it that bad at
       Sweet Apple Acres?

249
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,331
      It's bad everywhere.

250
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,066
         I thought I was
      doing something good.

251
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,034
    I thought I was helping.

252
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,636
    How could our friendship
 journal have led to so much...

253
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,205
        anti-friendship!?

254
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,774
       Oh, Twilight, it's
         not your fault.

255
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,542
    Of course it's my fault!

256
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,878
     If I hadn't had the big
      idea to make copies,

257
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,113
       none of this would
          be happening!

258
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,316
     I'm afraid I made life
      awful for my friends.

259
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,918
      I really think you're
   being too hard on yourself.

260
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,953
                    Am I?

261
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:19,393
Wah!

262
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,501
 I didn't know where else to go.

263
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,671
  I've got so much cookin' and
  cleanin' and familyin' to do,

264
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,807
        I ain't got time
       for anything else!

265
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,143
     At least ponies aren't
  laughing every time you talk!

266
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,012
      Not even I want to be
       funny all the time!

267
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,415
    I'm telling you, my days
  of hilariosityness... ness...

268
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,616
            are OVER.

269
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,653
 You think you've got problems?

270
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:52,390
 I know I'm awesome but I can't
     even go to the bathroom

271
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,227
   without somepony trying to
     tell me how cool I am.

272
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,930
        Uh...Rarity, what
        are you wearing?

273
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,431
My emotions, darling!

274
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,767
Stress couture!

275
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,236
 I don't know what I'm going to
  do if I have to defend myself

276
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,171
         one more time!

277
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,377
                 Oh. Er.. sorry, Darling.
                 Force of habit.

278
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,922
      OK, so maybe they are
   having a hard time with it.

279
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,124
      That doesn't mean you
       did anything wrong.

280
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,258
           Yes, I did!

281
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,628
          Releasing the
       journal was my idea

282
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,664
   and it backfired in ways I
   could never have imagined.

283
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,332
            It's not your fault.

284
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,000
          It's everypony else's!

285
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,369
           They're just focusing
           on the wrong things and-

286
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,371
                   Wait here!

287
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,272
               I've got an idea!

288
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,042
I can't wait any longer.

289
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,576
I've got to fix this.

290
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,116
     Everypony, please stop!

291
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:55,886
       Princess Twilight?

292
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,788
     I'm with the Canterlot
  Chronicle, quick question...

293
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,024
  What would you say to ponies
    who wonder why you moved

294
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,159
to Ponyville in the first place?

295
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,528
      I moved here to learn
        about friendship.

296
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,663
         That's why the
      journal even exists.

297
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,467
    It took some time for me
     to get the hang of it,

298
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,470
    but it was each of these
   ponies standing next to me

299
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,405
    who taught me the lessons
       in those journals.

300
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:15,706
           Applejack.

301
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:16,741
           Pinkie Pie.

302
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:17,942
          Rainbow Dash.

303
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:18,843
             Rarity.

304
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,211
      And Fluttershy, too.

305
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,080
         Then it was all of you.

306
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,115
            I've learned so much
                   from--

307
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,684
          What I mean is, some
         ponies would argue that

308
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,387
 it doesn't seem believable that
the six of you would be friends.

309
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:30,889
           Believable?

310
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:31,957
           Well, sure.

311
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,292
    I read this journal cover
   to cover and I have to say,

312
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,161
    your character would have
   been much more interesting

313
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,096
  if she'd stayed in Canterlot.

314
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,397
         My character!?

315
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,132
       We are real ponies.

316
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,800
        This journal is a
        record of things

317
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,669
          that actually
         happened to us.

318
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,205
      We made mistakes and
      we learned from them.

319
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,107
What about Rarity?

320
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,142
Are we really supposed to
believe she learned anything

321
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,343
she wrote in there?

322
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,679
         That's why you
       gotta be Team Dash!

323
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,315
  She's the only one who didn't
  really need to learn anything

324
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,317
because she was already so cool!

325
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,120
       Twilight was better
      before she got wings.

326
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,889
Fluttershy is just
so painfully shy,

327
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,991
it's hard to relate.
I mean, come on!

328
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,331
    Wait a minute, everypony!

329
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,100
       Are Pinkie Pie and
   Applejack related or what?

330
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,441
          Listen to me!

331
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,075
          LISTEN TO ME!

373
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,548
     So you see, everypony?

374
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,717
         None of us ever
     claimed to be perfect.

375
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,952
       Without our flaws,

376
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,288
      there wouldn't be any
  friendship lessons to learn.

377
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,290
      Without our flaws...

378
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,993
   ... there probably wouldn't
   be any friendships at all.

379
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,206
So that just
happened.

380
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,042
    Girls! I found two ponies
       who have something

381
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,378
    I think you should hear.

382
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,849
Um... we just wanted to say
thank you to all of you.

383
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,051
     Yeah. Our friendship...

384
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,387
  well, we were having trouble
   until we read your journal.

385
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,791
It showed us that friends can go
through all sorts of tough times

386
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,826
        and come through
      stronger than before.

387
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,429
It's made us better friends
than we've ever been.

388
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,097
Really?

389
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,766
             Mm-hm.

390
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,569
Oh, I can't tell you how
much it means to hear that.

391
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,605
Thank you for telling us.

392
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,373
We've had a tough
couple of days.

393
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,675
But knowing we've helped
fillies like you...

394
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,512
    It makes everything we've
     been through worth it.

395
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,213
                     Absolutely.

396
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,383
             Fads come and go;
          friendship is forever.

397
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,853
   There are worse things than
  not being able to do anything

398
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,789
 without being told I'm awesome.

399
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,858
   And we can't change the way
  other ponies think about us,

400
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,561
      but we can change how
      we let it affect us.

401
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,030
                Or how we don't
               let it affect us.

402
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,401
        Heh. Heh. Go ahead. Laugh!

403
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,648
Reckon we still have to
deal with them, don't we?

404
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,554
     Stay in the friendship
       moment, Applejack.

405
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,689
They can wait a little longer.
