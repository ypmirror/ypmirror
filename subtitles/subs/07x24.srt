1
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,405
              Oooh!

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,507
Excuse me, when
does the noon train

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,242
from the Crystal
Empire arrive?

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,578
                    Uh, noon?

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,248
Hm. Right. Sorry, I'm
just a little excited

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,083
because my friend
Sunburst is coming.

7
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,085
He's my oldest friend.

8
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,721
I mean, we've known each
other practically forever.

9
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,424
     We have tons in common.

10
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:28,494
We both love magic and games
and jokes. Everything, really.

11
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,697
Now that I think about it, there
isn't a pony in all of Equestria

12
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,232
I have more in
common with.

13
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,089
Sunburst: Starlight?

14
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,059
            Sunburst!

15
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,226
          You made it!

16
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,461
Of course!

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,963
I've been looking forward to
this visit for a long time.

18
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:07,985
                Huh..

19
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:09,835
              Whoa!

20
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,403
    How long are you staying?

21
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,706
Er.. just a... little
reading for the train.

22
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,609
              Same old Sunburst.

23
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:20,022
                Huh.

24
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,148
    It's going to be so great
     spending time together.

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,851
      Just like old times.

26
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:29,020
   You and me doing the stuff
    we like: games, magic...

27
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,055
Antiquing.

28
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,156
              What?

29
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,257
Antiquing.

30
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,625
You know I like antiquing.

31
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:34,493
                      You do?

32
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,662
         Um, of course!

33
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,498
     Historical knickknacks,
         ancient relics.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,667
        Oh! You are SO lucky!

35
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,936
  Ponyville is antique central!

36
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,537
             It is..?

37
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,473
How have we never
talked about this?

38
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,709
We are going antiquing
and you are gonna love it!

39
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:54,380
       OK. Let's drop your stuff
       off at the castle first.

40
00:01:54,782 --> 00:02:00,219
    Sure! Only.. heh.. we may need
     to make a few trips.

41
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,227
        This is so great!

42
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,929
         Who knew I'd be
         the one showing

43
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,664
       you the cool sights
          of Ponyville?

44
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,700
 I'm a little surprised, myself.

45
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,408
 Wow, what a difference between
     the hoof-molded bricks

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,244
  and the extruded ones, right?

47
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,178
         Uh huh. Ha ha.

48
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,850
       Oooh! Check out all
       these chandeliers!

49
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,254
     Sometimes the crystals
    have magical properties.

50
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,955
                Oh. That's cool.
                 How do you--

51
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,923
Twilight: Sunburst!

52
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,226
           I'm so glad
          you're here!

53
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,528
      In the antique store?

54
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,728
In Ponyville!

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,565
Starlight's really been
looking forward to your visit.

56
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,802
Though I'm glad you're
in the antique store too!

57
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,537
I'm usually the only one...

58
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,339
                   That's crazy!

59
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,740
                   Who doesn't
                 like antiquing?

60
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:29,641
                         Right?

61
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,477
             Heh heh... right!

62
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,479
Oooh, look!

63
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,616
     An ancient map of Equestria
      made by the Mighty Helm!

64
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,852
Without the help of unicorn
magic or pegasus flight,

65
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,821
the earth ponies
of the Mighty Helm

66
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,724
were able to map the
entire coast of Equestria!

67
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,626
                   Coooool..

68
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,894
You don't have to pretend
to like all this stuff.

69
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,432
                What? No. I
                do like it. Heh.

70
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,901
             I mean, if you
             like it, I like it.

71
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,237
        Besides, we've almost
    looked at everything.. right?

72
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,405
       Twilight: Oh, wow!

73
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,841
    You have got to see this
     Saddle Arabian vanity!

74
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,379
     This shop looked a lot
    smaller from the outside.

75
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,804
        Did you see this
    Palominian letter opener?

76
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,441
  Wow! That goes well with this
 ancient Phoenix feather quill.

77
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,109
                  We could write
                  to each other!

78
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,711
            PEN PALS!

79
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,452
       Um.. I really like this
        old-timey barrel.

80
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,889
      Actually, the stuff I
  bought is inside the barrel,

81
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,925
        but I can't wait
       to see what it is!

82
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,061
      Wait, you don't know
        what you bought?

83
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,897
        Mm-mm! It's a blind buy.

84
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,833
  Sometimes shops get too busy
    to go through everything

85
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,602
      so they load up a box
      or barrel and sell it

86
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,404
         without knowing
         what's inside!

87
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,773
           Buying one is sort of
           like a treasure hunt.

88
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,011
  Once I found a first edition
      History of Equestria

89
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,480
  in the original Olde Ponish.

90
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,916
   "<i> Hliet foresettan pliht."</i>

91
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,721
It's an Olde Ponish saying.

92
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,891
"Reward prefers risk."

93
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,861
Uh. It... loses something
in the translation.

94
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,432
              Mmm. [giggle]

95
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,468
       Hm. Why don't we look
       through this stuff later?

96
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,870
     Yeah. What do you want
        to do, Starlight?

97
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:16,407
Well, I don't know if you're
going to remember this, but...

98
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,110
           [gasp] Is this...

99
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,848
           DRAGON PIT!

100
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,349
                      I remember
                      that game.

101
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,651
                    You two used
                     to play it?

102
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,554
     Heh. Pretty much any time we
    weren't working on magic.

103
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,056
         I can't believe
        you found a copy!

104
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,130
Sunburst would get so excited
whenever his dragon got trapped

105
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,733
he'd knock the whole board over!

106
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,268
                That's adorable.

107
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,837
  Eh.. well, it's an exciting game.

108
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,772
    But I have a little more
    control over my horn now.

109
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,582
Uh-oh!

110
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:59,284
Somepony's dragon's
gonna get trapped!

111
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,724
                 Doesn't seem so
                 exciting to m--

112
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:07,859
                   AAAHAHHAHAHH!

113
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:12,264
                  Huh. I guess it is adorable.

114
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,404
          I hope you're enjoying
            your visit so far.

115
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,672
        Are you kidding!?

116
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,376
I mean, first antiquing and then
  spending time with Twilight!

117
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,278
            Oh. Yeah.

118
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,180
       She's.. pretty great.

119
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,615
Right? I mean, I know
she's a Princess,

120
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,952
but I never thought she'd be so
fun to just hang out with.

121
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:37,356
        Well, she is the
     Princess of Friendship.

122
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:38,757
             [chuckle] Right.

123
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,025
    I guess that makes sense.

124
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,227
                     So. Tomorrow
                     I thought--

125
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,164
I suppose I'm just surprised
at how well we get along.

126
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,100
I don't have much in
common with most ponies.

127
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,836
   You two are pretty similar.

128
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,505
  I don't know many ponies who
   are fluent in Olde Ponish.

129
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,407
            Exactly!

130
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,109
I probably have more in
common with Twilight

131
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,079
than any pony in Equestria!

132
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,647
                  Right.

133
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,917
Anyway, I better
get some sleep.

134
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,921
[yawn] Ponyville might be small,
but there's a lot to do.

135
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,390
Maybe we should ask Twilight
what she recommends we see!

136
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,992
                       Um, sure.

137
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,094
Great! Goodnight, Starlight.

138
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,196
         Um, goodnight.

139
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,540
          [door opens]
          Knock, knock!

140
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:29,741
            Wh-what!?

141
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,777
       Oh. Hi, Starlight.

142
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,478
     Is it morning already?

143
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,580
                     Yep!

144
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,949
              Maybe a bit early,
              but like you said,

145
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,885
               there's a lot to
               see in Ponyville!

146
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,588
  Uh, right. OK.

147
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,224
  Heh. Plus, I couldn't really sleep.

148
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:48,260
 I just kept thinking about all
   the stuff we have in common

149
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,195
        and how much fun
        we'll have today.

150
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,031
Great. Is Twilight up yet?

151
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,835
 A-Actually, I'm pretty sure she's
 busy with Princess stuff today.

152
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,536
        Oh. [yawn]

153
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:04,209
But I've got a full day of stuff
    planned, just you and me.

154
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,210
               Uh. Great!

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,682
   Um. Would you mind turning
    around, or preferably...

156
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,884
       leaving the room so
      I could get changed?

157
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,921
               Oh! Right! Ha ha,
                sorry, ah ha...

158
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:22,527
One, genuine, Sweet
Apple Acres apple tree!

159
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,734
Because we used to drink so
much apple juice as foals?

160
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,470
     Hmm.. I don't remember that.

161
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,339
       Really? I mean, it
        was all we drank.

162
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,440
              Uh.. here.

163
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,808
          Try an apple. I bet that'll jog your memory.

164
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,148
                      Oh! Ow..

165
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,982
             Trixie?

166
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,384
    What are you doing here?

167
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:49,621
   I often seek the privacy of
     the orchard to practice

168
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,423
     new feats of amazement.

169
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,559
    And, also I fell asleep.

170
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,663
    Oh. Well, Sunburst and I
  were just catching up, so...

171
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,865
     [gasp] I don't suppose the two
       of you want to see

172
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,434
    a never-before-witnessed
         magical marvel?

173
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:03,735
  Sure!

174
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,970
                    [sigh] Why not.

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,676
     Behold, visiting friend
      from Starlight's past

176
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,913
      and be amazed by the
       Great and Powerful

177
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:18,817
     and current best friend
      of Starlight, TRIXIE!

178
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,129
          I give you...

179
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,766
       THE UNICORN ESCAPE!

180
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,301
            [grunts]

181
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,870
       One more...twist...

182
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,840
         and... [grunts]

183
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,308
          The great and
         powerful Trixie

184
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,243
        requires a little
         assistance.

185
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,147
I know this trick.

186
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,082
There's a special link,
but I could never

187
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,984
hold the chain up long
enough to find it.

188
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,667
        Well, if I could
       do magic like that,

189
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,603
  I'd have a whole slew of new
     tricks at my disposal.

190
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,140
  I always liked close up magic
  because I knew I could do it

191
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,641
   if I just practiced enough.

192
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,156
         Starlight, why
       didn't you tell me

193
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,759
       how much Sunburst
      and I had in common?

194
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,195
     Gee. I don't know.

195
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,567
     I know Trixie's "magic"
      is, you know, fun...

196
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,503
       but the Mirror Pool
        is actual magic.

197
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:22,541
        Whoa! This place
        is pure ponylore.

198
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,478
   Yep. I mean, it's supposed
      to be all dangerous.

199
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,214
    I guess I shouldn't have
   broken the seal to get in,

200
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,984
    but you wanted to see the
   sights of Ponyville, right?

201
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,720
   So, Pinkie Pie just dove in
   and made copies of herself?

202
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,355
                    Mm-hm!

203
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,925
 If we made copies of ourselves,

204
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:43,594
 we could get a year's worth of
  hanging out over in one day.

205
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,598
       Eh.. not that we would.

206
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,000
        Do you hear that?

207
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,438
Ooh. I hope it's not a
left over Pinkie Pie.

208
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,873
                   Maud: Not exactly.

209
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,209
Maud? How did
you get in here?

210
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,712
     This cavern's actually
       connected to mine.

211
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,080
             Ah.. what are you doing?

212
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,014
            Tapping.

213
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,816
                    Maud isn't
                   super chatty.

214
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,419
   I mean, you and I could sit
    around and talk all day,

215
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,454
   but she looks pretty busy.

216
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,759
             Are you taking some
            kind of core sample?

217
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,794
     Not exactly.

218
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,830
   I'm uncovering this section
   of strata for closer study.

219
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,032
You might want to step back.

220
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,340
              I'm studying this
            area's metamorphic--

221
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:29,541
           --foliation!

222
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,244
         Is this gneiss,
       phyllite, or slate?

223
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,980
     Wow. The pressure above
     must be pretty uniform

224
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,616
    to get the planar fabric
     to be this consistent.

225
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,284
         You know about geology?

226
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,685
            I dabble.

227
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,954
       For example, by the
    speleothems in this cave,

228
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,257
      I kinda figured there
      was another way out.

229
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,726
                Because of the
               calcite deposits.

230
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,250
                      Starlight?

231
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,419
               Where's Sunburst?

232
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,822
 Doing stage magic with Trixie?

233
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,990
  Studying new rocks with Maud?

234
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,493
   You're here so I guess you
   two aren't off translating

235
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,496
 some ancient Olde Ponish text.

236
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:25,831
   What are you talking about?

237
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,033
       Why would Sunburst
      be doing any of that?

238
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,402
      I thought he came to
      Ponyville to see you.

239
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,840
I thought so too, but it
hasn't worked out that way.

240
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,909
       When we were foals,
      we had more in common

241
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,212
       than any two ponies
          in Equestria.

242
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,914
      But now it seems like
     he's got more in common

243
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,083
      with my friends than
        he does with me.

244
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,388
     Oh. Everypony changes,
      but that doesn't mean

245
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,123
       there aren't still
      things you both like.

246
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,259
   You both love magic, right?

247
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,360
             Magic?

248
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,796
      Sure. You're
    really good at it

249
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,866
 and Sunburst practically knows
   every spell that ever was.

250
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,867
                   [gasp] You're right!

251
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,002
        Thanks, Twilight!

252
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,003
        You're the best!

253
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,872
   Eh. I try.

254
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,574
    Starlight, what happened?

255
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,510
      Maud and I found some
fascinating sedimentary stratum,

256
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,113
      but when I turned to
    show you, you were gone.

257
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,049
 Maud does have a way of making
    rocks really interesting,

258
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,886
     but I wanted to work on
  something a little more "us."

259
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:25,690
          What's this?

260
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,192
                Just a little
            something I made up.

261
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,465
Whoa! You made up this
spell? Just now?

262
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:34,833
                      Yep!

263
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,314
      Wow.

264
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,015
                  I know, right?

265
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,651
         But wait, there's more.

266
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,795
                    Cool, right?

267
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,597
            Um, sure.

268
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,498
Now we can play Dragon Pit!

269
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,866
Just like we used to.

270
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,238
Actually, I thought we
could go with Maud and--

271
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,907
   I mean, nothing was better
      than just you and me

272
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,209
     playing this game when
      we were foals, right?

273
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,244
Starlight..

274
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,179
 Do you what to be red or blue?

275
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,581
           Starlight!

276
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,450
I don't want to play
the game at all!

277
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,396
What's going on in here?

278
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:41,199
  Nothing. I was trying to have
     fun doing the ONE thing

279
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,934
       I thought we still
         had in common,

280
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,637
    but I guess we don't even
       have that anymore.

281
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:55,912
       I don't understand...

282
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,583
 Starlight and I have known each
   other since we were foals,

283
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,987
    but that doesn't mean we
  have to be foals to hang out.

284
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,724
      Hm. Starlight does have a
      tendency to over-do.

285
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,060
  I mean, it is surprising how
      well I get along with

286
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,697
 all of her friends, but she and
  I still have tons in common.

287
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,700
  Maybe you just need to remind
   her what those things are.

288
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,235
   That's it!

289
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,104
That's exactly what I'll do.

290
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,106
Right after I think of them.

291
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:23,808
Oh.

292
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:31,015
   Obviously you and I hit it
   off. I am quite impressive.

293
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,684
       And we share a love
      for prestidigitation!

294
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,187
                    Right.

295
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,623
       And Starlight and I share
         a lot of things too.

296
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,525
                  I just need to
                  think of them.

297
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,527
              What else do you
            guys have in common?

298
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,697
Well, we've both made
not-so-great choices in the past

299
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:53,271
 and we're self-conscious about
      everypony judging us

300
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,106
 even though we've
   both changed

301
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,508
 and are trying hard
    to be better.

302
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,477
      Yeah... we don't really have that.

303
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,852
      Hmph! I can think of
  something you have in common.

304
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,824
You're both poor
practice audiences.

305
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,729
  Starlight and I don't really
      have a lot in common.

306
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,465
       Other than feeling
   different from most ponies.

307
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,000
           And comedy.

308
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,101
  Comedy?

309
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,371
         I'm very funny.

310
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:28,572
Was that a joke?

311
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,274
                       No.

312
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,376
Well, that's more
than I can think of

313
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:32,876
that she and I
have in common.

314
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,980
 We don't really spend that much
time talking about that, though.

315
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,549
  Mostly we're just comfortable
       around each other.

316
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,651
  [sigh] We used to be...

317
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,420
   We did everything together.

318
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,089
 But now I'm wondering if we've
    spent so much time apart

319
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,957
      that we don't connect
      over anything anymore

320
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,292
         and if we can't
      connect over anything

321
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,061
        then maybe we're
        not even friends!

322
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,563
               Well, at least
               it's not serious.

323
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,632
        That.. was a joke.

324
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,538
[sigh] I appreciate you trying
to help, Twilight.

325
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,642
But it seems pretty clear that
Sunburst and I have grown apart.

326
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:05,944
          I understand.

327
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,013
    But I feel like that only
   happens if you both let it.

328
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,182
        You still want to
       be friends, right?

329
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,385
I created a spell so we could
re-live playing a game

330
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,020
in our childhood home...

331
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,722
   and bodies.

332
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,724
                  Right....

333
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,094
I'm just not sure Sunburst
wants to stay friends too.

334
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,196
               I think you might
                 be surprised.

335
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:29,700
Prepare yourself...

336
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,002
                     For the new
                    and improved

337
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,804
                     Dragon Pit!

338
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,976
    We had to take out a few
     spaces to get it to fit

339
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,544
    but you hardly miss them.

340
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,413
       Maud made the dice.

341
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,086
Pumice is the
lightest igneous rock.

342
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,688
It seems the
best choice.

343
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,826
And I added the special effects.

344
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,497
There's nothing like a little
well-placed magic smoke.

345
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,968
  Looks like somepony's dragon
    is going to get trapped.

346
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,804
I thought you didn't
wanna play this game.

347
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,473
          Well, I didn't want to
           pretend to be a foal,

348
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,175
                 but I know you
                 wanted to play.

349
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,244
       I thought it'd be fun to
       play a version big enough

350
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,678
          for full grown ponies.

351
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,314
              What do you think?

352
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:17,382
                     Fun, right?

353
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,956
Actually, it's
missing something.

354
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:30,994
          AHHHGHHHHHH!

355
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,399
          [chuckle] Now it's fun.

356
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,979
          I don't know why I got
            so worried about us

357
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,715
             not having anything
                 in common.

358
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,417
Yeah. I kind of think
it doesn't matter

359
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,486
as long as we enjoy
each other's company.

360
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,555
    Trixie: And that game was
      certainly enjoyable.

361
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,092
    What made it even better
     was getting to play it

362
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,527
      with all my friends.

363
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:10,968
                  See you soon?

364
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,070
   You bet.

365
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,238
I want to hear if you find
anything interesting

366
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,273
in that barrel.

367
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,907
            Trust me, Starlight.

368
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,476
                   You'll be the
                  first to know!
