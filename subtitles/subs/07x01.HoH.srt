Maybe it is.
Just a little.

354
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:46,512
Oh, it definitely
is. Like a lot.

355
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:50,724
Here we are after all
these years, Twilight.

356
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,504
We are living proof
that letting someone

357
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,392
spread their wings doesn't
mean you no longer have

358
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:58,236
a place in their lives.

359
00:17:58,628 --> 00:17:59,352
Thank you.

360
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,956
And if you're still worried,

361
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,300
you can always make
her write you letters!

your big plan for Starlight
tonight. Silly me.

366
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,324
But we're all very excited to
hear what you've cooked up.

You weren't coming up with
a plan just now, were you?

368
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:35,028
Oh, dear. This could be
pretty embarrassing for you.

369
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,332
Gee, thanks Discord.

370
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:40,168
Anytime. I really do
love being helpful.

As you all know, Starlight
Glimmer has been my pupil

375
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:52,232
for a while now and I'd
hoped she'd be my pupil

376
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:55,316
for a long time yet to
come, but it turns out

377
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,268

Starlight, you have proved
yourself to be a kind,

loyal, strong, honest
and truly magical friend.

you've made,

I know there's nothing
more I need to teach you.

Wow. I was not expecting this.

Darn it. I was hoping you'd
send her to my realm.

I was putting down.

How do you wanna celebrate?
Girls trip to Las Pegasus?

395
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:46,888
We can throw you a
changeling Gorbfest!

Uh, it's more fun
than it sounds.

397
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,652
Or we could go cause
a little mischief.

398
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:58,400
I know a trick that'll turn
Celestia's castle into cheese.

Do you think it's
a gouda idea? Ha!

of many cheese jokes

wonderful but um...

'congrats on getting a
medal of honor present',

it would have to be a
