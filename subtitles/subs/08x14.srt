1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,772
Who can tell me what these are?

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,907
    [Various] Treasure?
     Shiny! Me likey. Whoa.

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,875
             Nope!

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,412
     They're all legendary
      magical artifacts!

5
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:17,349
   Heh.  I read ahead in Equestrian
   Cultures and Camaraderie.

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,385
         Volume seven.

7
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,986
     You're right, Ocellus!

8
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,923
 This is the Amulet of Aurora,
  the Talisman of Mirage,

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,127
      the Helm of Yksler,
      the Crown of Grover,

10
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:31,797
   Knuckerbocker's Shell and
   Clover the Clever's Cloak.

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,332
          And the gems are real!

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,503
    Er.. not that I tasted them..

13
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,071
    Princess Celestia gifted
     these to our school,

14
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,107
   since they each represent
     one of the cultures

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,475
    our students come from.

16
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,846
 And we'll learn all about them
   with a Spell-venger hunt!

17
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,752
     Is that a pony thing?

18
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:53,429
               Meh.

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,121
                 It's a magical
                 scavenger hunt!

20
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,422
     Each of you will work
    in pairs to try to find

21
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,192
   where in the school these
     artifacts are hidden.

22
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,227
  The team that finds the most
    wins a private tour

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,729
   of the Canterlot archives
    with Princess Celestia.

24
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:05,631
            Mm-hm!

25
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:09,100
Oooh! Learning AND fun?

26
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,537
 Does it get any
better than that!?

27
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,841
    You've been underwater a
    <i>long</i> time, haven't you?

28
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,376
    Twilight: Gallus and Silverstream?

29
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,345
Sounds like you're
our first pair.

30
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:22,582
   What? They'll make
     a great team!

31
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,784
     Um. Why pony glowing?

32
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,229
  Wait, you all were called on
  this friendship quest, too?

33
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,399
             It must be a <i>really</i>
               important one.

34
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,768
                    And terribly
                     far away.

35
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,140
       Ugh. Just getting there
        will take DAYS!

36
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,775
    Do y'all know
   what this means?

37
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,978
There won't be any teachers
left to run the school!

38
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,921
       Should we send
       our students home?

39
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,589
I say we take
'em with us!

40
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,790
ROAD TRIP!

41
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,593
         In the middle of my
      friendship quilting class?

42
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,994
                    I think not!

43
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,963
                 All of those
               unfinished seams....

44
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:50,702
   Problem is, we don't even
  know how long we'll be gone!

45
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:51,870
Twilight: Don't worry, everypony.

46
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,739
  I already have a
seventy-point plan in place

47
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,174
    for this very situation.

48
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,445
  You want ME to be Headmare?

49
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,913
  You're the
perfect choice.

50
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,450
You're a good leader,
and an expert in
friendship!

51
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,153
    I trust you to run this
   school exactly as I would.

52
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,456
    Uh, that's a pretty big
  responsibility, Twilight...

53
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,260
Which is why I've prepared
everything you need!

54
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,401
The curriculum, rules
for the Spellvenger hunt,

55
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,737
dining hall menus for
the next six months.

56
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,040
          Six months!?

57
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,009
   You're not really gonna be
    gone that long, are you?

58
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,078
And Spike.

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,746
Anything that isn't
covered in my files,

60
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,148
he'll be able to
help you with.

61
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,483
        Then why not put
         him in charge?

62
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,452
             No-o-o, thanks.

63
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,222
   Being a princess for
   Twilight was hard enough.

64
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,491
       I'm gonna pretend
       that made sense.

65
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,828
    But if you're sure it's
    what you really want...

66
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,096
I promise I won't let you down.

67
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,265
  I knew I could count on you.

68
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,134
           [rustling]
           Gah!

69
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,587
                 Great.....

70
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:59,538
 What could possibly go wrong?

71
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,644
Good-bye, Rarity!

72
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,612
And everypony!

73
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,913
                 Come back soon!

74
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:09,815
                   Please.

75
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,285
        Huh?

76
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,954
  I hate goodbyes, don't you?

77
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,856
      I just go to pieces!

78
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,492
            Discord!

79
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,593
           What a...

80
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,296
         nice surprise!

81
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,865
   This is your first time at
   our new school, isn't it?

82
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,901
     Oh, was I not invited
     to the grand opening?

83
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,037
    Friends and Family Day?
     Baccalaureate?

84
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,972
       All: I hadn't noticed.

85
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,443
Well, at least you're here now!

86
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,479
   Um, why ARE you here now?

87
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,181
   To fill in for
Twilight, of course.

88
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,016
As Headdraconequus.

89
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:47,386
 I seem to recall a whole song
 about how this school

90
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,288
       is where you make
        your own rules.

91
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,557
Now who better at that than me?

92
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,893
  Then you ALSO must've heard
  Starlight is in charge now.

93
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,496
         Really? I thought there
          must be some mistake.

94
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,099
Nope, Twilight picked
me for the job.

95
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,969
And she left pretty detailed
instructions for me to follow.

96
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,871
      Well, I'm sure that
       she wouldn't mind

97
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,840
        if I made a few
       TINY suggestions.

98
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:14,212
 Item one, gravity is optional.

99
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,048
             Whoa!

100
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,520
         Item two, the
      school's new mascot

101
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,889
  is an ambidextrous marmoset.

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,660
          Item three...

103
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:29,729
Not gonna happen.

104
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,397
I promised Twilight I'd
handle this her way.

105
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,365
So thanks, but no thanks.

106
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,170
          Reeeeeeally?

107
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:43,241
      Well, we'll see if
     you change your mind..

108
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,879
             Uh oh.

109
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,581
       When we play Ogres
        and Oubliettes,

110
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,251
     and he puts that many
      eeeees in "really",

111
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,086
 things don't usually end well.

112
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,371
Don't worry, Spike.

113
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,655
Discord and I are old
save-Equestria buddies.

114
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:58,590
He'll be fine.

115
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,292
Now, what's next
on Twilight's list?

116
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,503
    OK, I hid the artifacts
    for the Spellvenger hunt

117
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,505
     and ordered school
     supplies for the week.

118
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,975
     All you have to worry
    about is teaching class.

119
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,576
         Ah. Thanks, Spike.

120
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,644
       Maybe we will get
       through this OK.

121
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,690
   Come in, come in, you'll
   let the twittermites out.

122
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:33,825
         Twittermites?

123
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:35,928
              OW!

124
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,463
  Discord! What are you doing?

125
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,100
                   Nopony was at
                    your desk.

126
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,669
             Imagine what
             Twilight would say!

127
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,305
Oh! How could
you, Starlight?

128
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,409
You've broken my trust
and failed me completely!

129
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,811
Oh, don't worry,
I'll cover for you.

130
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,213
By the way, I hope you
like Limburger cheese.

131
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,749
I got a month's supply
for the teacher's lounge.

132
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,419
             Aaah!

133
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,326
       We'll take it from
         here, Discord.

134
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,529
      Go relax, have a
      cup of tea. At home.

135
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,200
Ah! Some thanks for all my help.

136
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:19,304
  And after I hired all those
  substitute teachers for you.

137
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,242
      Actually, that does
      sound kinda helpful.

138
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:25,744
      And it was next
       on our to do list.

139
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,048
  WHICH teachers did you hire?

140
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,454
  They call it making friends
 because you have to

141
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,990
       MAKE creatures be
        your friends!

142
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,159
                   Show me what
                   you got, Yak.

143
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,196
                    Ahem.

144
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,331
                   Be my friend.

145
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,402
If you're quiet, I don't buy it!

146
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,771
         Be my friend!

147
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,674
I've heard pudding
that's more convincing!

148
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,311
            BE. MY.

149
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,145
            FRIEND!

150
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,917
    That's not how Twilight
      teaches friendship.

151
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,991
        Some field trip!

152
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,760
      Where's my iced tea?

153
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,731
       This is too cold.

154
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,203
       Now it's too hot!

155
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,842
   Now it's too TEA-FLAVORED!

156
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,144
  You call yourselves friends?

157
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,716
 That is definitely not how
  Twilight teaches friendship.

158
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,026
You hired a TREE
 as a teacher?

159
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,894
     Its schedule was free.

160
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,296
Spike: Uh, guys?

161
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,465
That's not
just any tree.

162
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,036
     Achoo!

163
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:59,137
      [blowing] It's a
       Dragonsneeze tree.

164
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,714
    W-Wait Wait! Calm down,
     every creature.

165
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,049
       It's gonna be OK!

166
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,351
             Hi-YA!

167
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,321
         BE MY FRIEND!

My my my, you do seem like
you're in over your head.

170
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,196
Won't Twilight be
so disappointed

171
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:29,167
   with how you're ruining, I
    mean RUNNING her school?

172
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,381
                Discord! This is
               all your fault!

173
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,984
Mine? I thought YOU
were in charge here.

174
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,553
But I'm happy to pitch
in if you need me.

175
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,323
                What I need is
               for you to leave!

176
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,261
           Happy now?

177
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,996
               Come on, Discord.

178
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,764
               You know that's
             not what she means.

179
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:00,766
             Fine.

180
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,901
     From now on, I
       won't try to help.

181
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,769
            AT ALL!

182
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,440
         Thanks, Spike.

183
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,409
        Let's just hope
        he stays gone.

184
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,043
I wouldn't count on it.

185
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,045
      I think Discord's
      trying to test you.

186
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,547
            But why?

187
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,116
   I thought we were friends!

188
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:18,817
    Well it's kinda what he does.

189
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,919
     Even to ponies or
    dragons he cares about.

190
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,622
Oh. Well, I'm ready
   for him.

191
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,424
          I told Twilight I'd
           run her school right,

192
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,727
              and I'm gonna
              keep that promise.

193
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,362
        No matter what..

194
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,538
    Starlight: Good morning, students!

195
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,906
  I know there's been a little
    bit of adjustment

196
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,942
      since the Professors
      left for their trip,

197
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,678
      but I've brought in
       new new teachers,

198
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,649
and now everything
should run smoothly!

199
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,484
Now it's time for class!

200
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:56,087
And don't forget, this afternoon
is the Spellvenger hunt!

201
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,127
[door slams open]
 [startled gasps]

202
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,497
Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures.

203
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,100
      Is this seat taken?

204
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,204
         Welcome class!

205
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:17,242
 You may call me the Great and
  Powerful Professor Trrrr--

206
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:20,879
              Shh!

207
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,649
Really, that's so inconsiderate.

208
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,054
   Oh, I'd better take this.

209
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,424
             Hello?

210
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,993
        Oh, he did not.

211
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,227
     And what did you say?

212
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,063
        [gasp] You did not!

213
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,734
      Discord, why are <i>you</i> here?

214
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,003
Why I'm a student of
friendship, of course!

215
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,173
Unless you don't think you're
good enough to teach me...

216
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,176
                Of course, I am!

217
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,211
     No fruit calls in my class.

218
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,919
  Magic is the most important
  element of friendship.

219
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:06,825
So today, I, the Great and
Powerful Trixie, will put on...

220
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,359
         A MAGIC SHOW!

221
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,745
    Oh, oh oh, I'm learning
     SO much, aren't you?

222
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,748
       GRRRRRR...Discord!

223
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,022
             Hello?

224
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:40,558
     Um, what exactly IS a
      long-distance plan?

225
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,832
       Take a lap, team!

226
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:51,770
 Uh, actually, we just finished
 Professor Spitfire's workout.

227
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,039
  Sounds like somepony
   needs a little motivation.

228
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,383
       I've never run so
       fast in my life!

229
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:05,850
         This is great!

230
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,488
          Huh. Hey, Coach?

231
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,889
        We need a break.

232
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,591
  Friendship is about honesty.

233
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,594
  So believe me when I say...

234
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,195
We're not stopping!

235
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,472
   Yona...can't run...faster.

236
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,848
    Discord, that's enough!

237
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,684
      Endangering students
       crosses the line!

238
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,287
  I don't know why you're
  trying to ruin this school,

239
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,055
       but it stops now!

240
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,293
     I wouldn't be so sure.

241
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,663
   This is your last warning...

242
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,099
 Hey, take it easy, Starlight.

243
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,934
Discord's your friend, remember?

244
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,837
 Well, he's not acting like it.

245
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,038
     She's right, Discord.

246
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,372
      What's your problem?

247
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,808
                   My problem?

248
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,843
 How is the fact that Twilight
 decided to put an incompetent,

249
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:10,515
 power-hungry unicorn in charge
 of her school MY PROBLEM?

250
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,327
    Ha ha hah.. Don't worry.

251
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,163
    I just banished him from
    school grounds forever.

252
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,397
           He's fine!

253
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,803
       That probably made
         things worse.

254
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,604
             Why didn't you just
              talk to Discord?

255
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,473
Because he's right
about one thing..

256
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,376
I've been doing a
terrible job as Headmare.

257
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,744
                No, you haven't!

258
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,247
                 Discord is just
                 being... Discord.

259
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,266
        Maybe.

260
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,884
  But I wonder why me being in
  charge bothers him so much.

261
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,388
  We can figure that out
  AFTER the Spellvenger Hunt.

262
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,290
            Come on!

263
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,595
      For this afternoon's
       Spellvenger Hunt,

264
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,697
     you'll need to use the
     artifacts' history

265
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,067
     to find where they're
     hidden in the castle.

266
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,436
    When you spot one, touch
     it with a magic shield

267
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,905
         to keep track
         of your score.

268
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,508
Twilight left a list of your
 hunt partners before she left.

269
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,710
   I'll pass out the shields.

270
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,117
Ready, set... Spellvenger Hunt!

271
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,589
 C'mon, we can use Twilight's
observatory to watch the teams!

272
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,428
I hope you know
where you're going.

273
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,330
     To the Helm of Yksler!

274
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:33,837
       Eh, works for me.

275
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:41,271
In our book, it says Yksler
 was an honorable Yak warrior.

276
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,809
  Any enemies that saw him put
  down their weapons in peace.

277
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,880
I think his artifact must be in
 one of these suits of armor.

278
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,219
     I'm guessing that one.

279
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,459
Yes! One down, five to go!

280
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:07,933
  Aw, Ocellus and Smolder
  found their first artifact!

281
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,701
       Wait. What's that?

282
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,740
I... don't think that's part
of the Spellvenger Hunt.

283
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,945
     The school is haunted!

284
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,914
           Agh! Not cool!

285
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:31,288
    We're totally gonna win
    this Spellvenger Hunt!

286
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,258
      Yeah, I doubt that.

287
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,460
   But at least I know where
   one of the artifacts is.

288
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,362
  Saw Spike hide it yesterday.

289
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,735
      The Crown of Grover!

290
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:44,969
             Score!

291
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:49,474
 They say it's magic, and King
 Grover used it to become

292
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,542
the first ruler of Griffonstone.

293
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,644
  I know, pretty sweet, right?

294
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,114
  You paid attention in class!

295
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,482
         What! If you
         ever tell an-

296
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,553
      Whoa! 3-D painting!

297
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,005
           Ha ha ha! Hoo hoo!

298
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,175
Yep, that's definitely Discord.

299
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,743
       This is not good.

300
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,778
     I thought you banished
      him from the school!

301
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,914
         Only his body.

302
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,749
   Apparently, his ghost can
    come and go just fine!

303
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,918
Let's go, we have to stop this.

304
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,923
How? No offense, but
I don't think magic

305
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,424
is the answer
against Discord.

306
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,127
This time, I'm not using magic.

307
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:46,530
              Hmm.

308
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,832
      What Yona look for?

309
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,800
  The shell of Knuckerbocker.

310
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,904
It's like a seashell, but if you
blow into it, you call a dragon!

311
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,140
     There's a sweet poem
     in our book about it.

312
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,211
   "Climb to the heights with
     dragon flight."

313
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,381
     [gasp] Like flight of stairs!

314
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,483
  Yona take pony word for it.

315
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:08,487
              Huh?

316
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,059
       What's happening!?

317
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,327
         Y-Yona not know!

318
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,565
   But Yona DO know Yona not
    like Spellvenger Hunt!

319
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,903
           Hahaha ha.

320
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,337
          Ho ho ho ho!

321
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,106
        Ah! Boo Boo-boo!

322
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:47,971
Oo! Woah!

323
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,363
      Everycreature, stop!

324
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,033
        But-but-but the
       school is haunted!

325
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,736
It's not haunted; it's Discord.

326
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,872
      Headmare Starlight!
       Look at me, look!

327
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,908
  I won the Spellvenger Hunt!

328
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,243
         Well done me!

329
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,611
      Now what's my prize?

330
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,146
           Detention.

331
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,148
  Well, that's disappointing.

332
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,855
    Discord, you can't keep
    messing up the school.

333
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,227
    On the contrary, I think
    I rather can, and will.

334
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,897
      Then I have just one
      thing to say to you.

335
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,199
 Oh, do go on.

336
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,567
                    I'm sorry.

337
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,235
         What?

338
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,908
 I had to stop thinking like a
  Headmare and start thinking

339
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,710
   like a Guidance Counselor
    to finally understand.

340
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,345
              You felt left out.

341
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:45,850
Uhh...... I-I-I-I don't know what
you're getting at.

342
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,453
             Nopony ever invited
             you to the school.

343
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,289
    And when you offered to
    help, I didn't listen.

344
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,991
  I was so worried about doing
  things Twilight's way,

345
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,961
     I didn't stop to think
   about being a good friend.

346
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,030
I'd like to apologize for that.

347
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,066
     And offer you the
     job of vice-headmare.

348
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,300
             -Huh?
            -Really?

349
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,335
             -What?
             -Why?

350
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,137
Totally confused.

351
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,773
           I ACCEPT!

352
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,011
 I mean, I.. I suppose I can find
 some time in my busy schedule

353
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,046
        to help you out.

354
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,849
But I will need my own office,
expense account, parking space.

355
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,219
   You're new to the world
   of education, aren't you?

356
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,123
 Next time you want something,
  just ask for it, all right?

357
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,160
But then we'd miss out on all
these delightful misadventures.

358
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,596
Hey! Watch the wings!

359
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,433
  Now, vice-headmare Discord,
  if you'll help me get this

360
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,134
Spellvenger Hunt back in order.

361
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,639
    Everything is re-hidden.

362
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,407
              Ah!

363
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:46,344
     [chuckles] Well, with
      a few surprises.

364
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:49,832
DISCORD!

365
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:53,117
I can't believe you tricked us
into going on a friendship quest

366
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,385
       that wasn't real!

367
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,688
       Oh, back so soon?

368
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,124
       A glamour spell on
        our cutie marks?

369
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,460
  A fake summons from the map?

370
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,262
      Hey, at least we got
       to go spelunking

371
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,963
     in that really creepy
     cave with all those

372
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,633
     eyeless worm
     creatures chasing us.

373
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,170
 Oh, Yona so glad ponies back.

374
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:16,341
   Uh, y'all get the feelin'
   we missed something?

375
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,243
Thanks for taking care
of the school, Starlight.

376
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,945
             It was a challenge.

377
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,013
         But I think
       things turned out

378
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,616
      just the way you'd
       have handled them.

379
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,818
    Guess this means you're
   not vice-headmare anymore.

380
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,655
Ooh poo! I just ordered
business cards!
