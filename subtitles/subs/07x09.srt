1
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:08,307
        Oh, thank you so
       much for helping me

2
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,609
    with these flyers, Spike.

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:13,713
 I'm so lucky you just happened
to be walking past the boutique.

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,215
         Er, yeah, right...

5
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,283
        just "happened to
      be walking past... "

6
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,118
            Ha-ha...

7
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,421
       What'cha got here?

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,521
"Lost dog?" "Balloons for sale?"
        "Guitar lessons?"

9
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:29,060
   'Cause I found one, I need
 some and yes, I am interested.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,401
No, it's a call for submissions.

11
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,569
         Fashion contest
         I'm organizing.

12
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,272
     A showcase for aspiring
        young designers.

13
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:41,974
            Oh, wow!

14
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,409
      What an awesome idea.

15
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,342
           Thank you.

16
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,779
   I remember how difficult it
  was to break into the fashion

17
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,515
         industry when I
        was starting out.

18
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,883
      That's why the winner
         of the contest

19
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,820
  will get to debut their line
    in the Carousel Boutique!

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,423
          So selfless.

21
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,491
          So generous.

22
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,794
    I've also managed to get
     esteemed fashion critic

23
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,665
 Hoity Toity and iconic fashion
    photographer Photo Finish

24
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,068
      to come to Ponyville
       and judge the show.

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,073
   And, wait until you hear who
    else will be a judge!

26
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,507
      Countess Coloratura?

27
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:16,975
         Sassy Saddles?

28
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:17,910
             Spike?

29
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,046
  No....

30
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:23,949
The third judge for the Carousel
Boutique's Couture du Futur

31
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,618
Fashion Contest is
none other than...

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,354
Applejack!

33
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,455
             What!?

34
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:30,622
                   What!?

35
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:31,858
          What!?

36
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,293
                     What?

37
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:13,965
        What?!

38
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,634
        You already said
         that, darling.

39
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,636
I know. But I had
 to say it again

40
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,738
because that's how
  confused I am.

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,508
You want me to judge
   a fashion show?

42
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,277
    I'm sure Rarity has her
reasons and once we hear them,

43
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,146
all of this will make sense.

44
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:30,549
           I admit, Applejack is
           an unorthodox choice.

45
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,652
    But that is precisely what
   makes her an inspired choice.

46
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,287
       See? Now it all...

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,457
  still doesn't make any sense.

48
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,560
    Hoity Toity has expertise
    in fabric and stitchwork.

49
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,563
  Photo Finish has an artistic
   eye for shapes and colors.

50
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,133
   But sometimes we designers
   forget about practicality!

51
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,136
       That's where you come in.

52
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:53,839
    Uh, I think I might be a
     little too "practical."

53
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,742
     My closet's nothing but
  twenty versions of this hat.

54
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,511
  Which tells me you're a pony
    who knows what she likes.

55
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,780
        Besides, a judge
         must be honest

56
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,049
       and you're the most
      honest pony there is.

57
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,951
                 Ask any pony,
               they'll tell you.

58
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,820
                Ooh! Let me try!

59
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:08,820
       'Scuse me.

60
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,456
Have you ever
heard of Applejack?

61
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,391
                The most honest
                pony there is?

62
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,392
                   Sure have.

63
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:14,860
                   See?

64
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,462
      So, what do you say?

65
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,264
Well, if I'm bein' honest...

66
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,716
      I don't think I'm the
     right pony for the job.

67
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,735
       Fashion just ain't
         my bag of oats.

68
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,738
                    Aw Booooooo!

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,574
                 I do understand
                your hesitation.

70
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,343
              But before you say
               no, sleep on it?

71
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,812
    Sure.

72
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,014
I guess I can do
  that for you.

73
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,125
      Yeah I know, Big Mac!

74
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,227
     I was just as surprised
           as you are.

75
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,665
     I mean, can you imagine
   me judgin' a fashion show?

76
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:57,835
           I'd do it!

77
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,806
  It sounds like fun getting to
  see all those pretty outfits.

78
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,842
Well, you're the exception
in our family, sugar cube.

79
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,645
               You know about
             that kind of stuff.

80
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:09,047
      I'd be as useful as a burr
        knot on a sapling tree.

81
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:16,889
Although, Rarity did say I just
 had to focus on practicality.

82
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,790
         She already has
       experts for the...

83
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,292
        fashion-y stuff.

84
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,062
      But I still wouldn't
        know what to say.

85
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,670
Come on, Apple Bloom, you're
doubling our workload here.

86
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,239
             Sorry.

87
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,807
       I wanted to wear a
    signature hat like yours,

88
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,077
         but it's making
        it harder to see.

89
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,279
That's because
it's not like mine.

90
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,849
You don't need a fancy
scarf to keep your hat on.

91
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,317
Now you can see.

92
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,254
              Hyah!

93
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,624
   Wow! That is a lot better.

94
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:53,993
       Thanks, Applejack.

95
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,261
           Sure thing.

96
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,861
         You know what?

97
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,598
         I am gonna help
     Rarity judge her show.

98
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,501
      I think my sensible,
    everypony take on fashion

99
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,870
    is exactly what the pony
        community needs.

100
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,973
        Rarity, I thought
       about it some more

101
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,943
    and if you still need me,
     I'd love to be a judge.

102
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:14,613
         Oooo, I just knew
       you'd come around!

103
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,749
       I, Photo Finish...

104
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,418
          have arrived!

105
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,687
       As has Hoity Toity.

106
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,823
   It's wonderful to see you!

107
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,490
                  Kiss.

108
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,224
        Kiss.

109
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:26,860
             Kiss!

110
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,428
        Thank you both so
      much for doing this!

111
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,801
 We missed you at Miss Pommel's
 debut in Manehattan last week.

112
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,936
Miss Pommel is showing?

113
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,172
I thought she was
still making costumes.

114
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,272
       You haven't heard?

115
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,942
    Everypony who is anypony
      is talking about it.

116
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,547
 Oh, my.

117
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,516
They're absolutely stunning.

118
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,986
It sure is great to hear
Miss Pommel is doing so well.

119
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,055
                     Who is this
                     who speaks?

120
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,156
     Oh, this is Applejack.

121
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,758
   Another one of the judges.

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,460
                      So, judge.

123
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,728
              What do you think?

124
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,598
     Oh, wow...

125
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,699
that is just...

126
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,600
     wow.

127
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,335
These are clothes?

128
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,205
       The photo is upside-down.

129
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,808
           This is...

130
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,610
  she looks like a disco ball.

131
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,913
      Did..did they have to roll
      her down the runway?

132
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,316
      Ha ha ha!

133
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:27,419
I can't believe anypony
would actually wear this!

134
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,188
Am I right?

135
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,490
      Oh, my!

136
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:32,392
                        I faint!

137
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,162
     Ha ha.. uh.. so funny.

138
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,470
       Oh, gosh, I didn't
     mean to make her faint.

139
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,906
Oh, don't worry
about it, darling.

140
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:48,874
Happens all the time.

141
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,646
  Besides, that dress did look
    a bit like a disco ball.

142
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,382
      Although, Miss Pommel
       is making the point

143
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:58,882
  that no matter what we wear,

144
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,653
       it is a costume of
      some kind or another.

145
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,323
I have no idea what
you're talkin' about.

146
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,057
         And that's OK!

147
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,660
        Let's go meet the
     designers and help them

148
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,061
     get ready for the show!

149
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,531
                     De-signers!

150
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,731
            Welcome!

151
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:18,603
   Today you will work on your
designs and we judges will offer

152
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,107
 our guidance and advice as you
prepare for tomorrow's big show!

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,447
           Lily Lace, tell us
         about your inspiration.

154
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:31,483
            You guys.

155
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,083
  This morning on my way here?

156
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:36,087
I heard a bird singing literally
     the most beautiful song

157
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,122
       I'd ever heard and
       I wanted to capture

158
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,958
         not so much the
      bird's song exactly?

159
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,362
   But more like how the wind
      carried the bird's song.

160
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:48,099
       Powerful, yet at the same
      time fragile and delicate.

161
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,735
            Uh.. Huh?

162
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,404
    Next up, meet Starstreak.

163
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,842
      I'm not interested in
    what's already been done,

164
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,446
         only what will
      exist in the future.

165
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,118
   Tomorrow's fashion belongs
  to those who hear it coming.

166
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,358
I am Inky Rose.

167
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:20,565
 You have a very focused vision.

168
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,068
        A strong sense of
     what you want is good!

169
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,820
Applejack, you've
been rather quiet.

170
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,138
What do you think?

171
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,942
   Well, it's a lot of black.

172
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,577
         It's kind of...

173
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,845
           depressing.

174
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:38,049
                   How's this?

175
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,852
  Makes a world of difference!

176
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,455
        Maybe to fashion
        experts like you,

177
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,058
       but to ponies like
      me, it's still black.

178
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,496
  And I'm not sure how you wear
  singing birds or the future.

179
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,872
       I don't think they
    liked what I had to say.

180
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,672
  Ah well, that's why you're here.

181
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,477
  Fashion needs a healthy dose
  of practicality now and then.

182
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:14,185
      Are you puttin' holes
        in the clothes...

183
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,253
                 on purpose?

184
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,422
        It's to create a
        distressed look.

185
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,724
              More like an "old
             and tattered" look.

186
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,093
           When a pony's old
       clothes get holes in 'em,

187
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,163
  they don't want to go to the
   store to buy new clothes...

188
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:25,963
       with holes in 'em.

189
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,399
             OK, yes, not a very
              practical choice.

190
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,702
                Fashionable, but
                 not practical.

191
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,308
        Simply stunning!

192
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,712
    Sure it looks pretty, but
     that's a lot of fabric.

193
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,347
  With the way it drags behind,

194
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,499
       it'll be covered in
        dirt in no time.

195
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,849
    Thank goodness I'm here.

196
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:49,120
   Otherwise we'd've had holes
  in clothes and dirty dresses.

197
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,663
   But of course, no look is complete
    without mane and make-up!

198
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,867
       So er.. when are you
       gonna do her mane?

199
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,803
   Uh! It's already been done!

200
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,503
You know what?

201
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,839
I think we've given the
designers enough guidance

202
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,508
for today.

203
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,477
Let's.. uh.. let them
finish their work.

204
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,514
  Can't wait to see what ya'll
  do for the big show tomorrow!

205
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,524
         Hey, Applejack!

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,098
        On your way home?

207
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,726
             How'd the first day
             of the contest go?

208
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,426
             Great!

209
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,763
       At first, I didn't
     think I'd be much help,

210
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,932
 but thank goodness I signed on!

211
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,702
 Without me, they'd be doin' all
 kinds of crazy fashiony things!

212
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,571
          Hey, Rarity.

213
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,471
       Applejack says the
     contest is going great!

214
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:44,843
                Good thing she's
                   there, huh?

215
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,077
Yes. Of course.

216
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,647
Some of her thoughts
are tough to swallow,

217
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,716
    but hopefully her candor
     will help the designers

218
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,552
        achieve the best
        designs possible.

219
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,686
                   You seem a
                little stressed.

220
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:56,754
                      Wanna try?

221
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,657
         Music is very relaxing!

222
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,159
       Sure.

223
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,467
        Ah, much better.

224
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,080
      I can meet my goals!

225
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,049
     Today is a fresh start!

226
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,651
    Good morning, everypony!

227
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,620
   Time for final adjustments
        before the show!

228
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,794
If buttons could convey
sadness, you've done it.

229
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,930
To me, they convey
waking up an hour early

230
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,231
just to button them all!

231
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,083
And that's if you could
reach most of 'em.

232
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,475
         Is this better?

233
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,178
There ya go.

234
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,880
Now when it's cold, you just
slide it on ya and you're set.

235
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,148
Like a poncho.

236
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,485
         Umm. "Poncho?"

237
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,326
         I attached each
        feather individually, haha.

238
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,461
It took me for literally ever.

239
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,301
Oh, you used hoof-crossed
double-over stitches!

240
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,903
They're perfect!

241
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,838
        Who cares if it's
       stitched perfectly?

242
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,373
         You don't need
     feathers on your head.

243
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,714
  My little sister tried to add
      some flair to her hat

244
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,314
   and guess what it got her?

245
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,452
  An extra hour of work pickin'
     apples off the ground.

246
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,893
A good start, but.. it needs more.

247
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:45,663
              No...

248
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,164
              No...

249
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,432
              No...

250
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:50,769
              Yes!

251
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,171
           I'd go with this one.

252
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,672
No! This one!

253
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,776
       Something is funny?

254
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,145
                   What? Oh, no.
                   It's just...

255
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,448
             I mean, those belts
               look the same.

256
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,050
That one completely
changes the look.

257
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,953
This one compliments it.

258
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,255
     You're kidding, right?

259
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,223
        Is everything OK?

260
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,260
     They're having a heated
  debate about those two belts.

261
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,064
    Oooh, both good choices.

262
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,333
         No! There is no choice!

263
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,235
  They're the exact same belt!

264
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,270
        This is so silly!

265
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,406
     Fashion is ridiculous!

266
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,109
      You don't mean that.

267
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,209
                    I do.

268
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,447
            I'm sorry but that's
             my honest opinion.

269
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,416
Well, I never
would have come

270
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,185
if I knew we were
going to be insulted!

271
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:44,055
             We go!

272
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,359
     No, please! Come back!

273
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,428
If they're out, I'm out too.

274
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,063
        I didn't get into
    fashion to design boring,

275
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,566
      utilitarian clothes.

276
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,969
I want to create
elegance and drama?

277
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,205
And this is lit'rally
the opposite of...

278
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,640
I mean, I can't even...

279
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,410
Yeah, no.

280
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:12,917
              What?

281
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,652
    I was just bein' honest!

282
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,061
        Stop everything!

283
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,562
        There is no show!

284
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,330
        Take it all down!

285
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,233
        Rarity, what's going on?

286
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,501
               Is everything OK?

287
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,502
            No!

288
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,238
    It is the opposite of OK.

289
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,840
    The judges have quit; the
   designers have dropped out;

290
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,308
     the show is cancelled!

291
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,710
           All my good
      intentions, squashed!

292
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,283
 And it's all Applejack's fault!

293
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,251
     Why are you mad at me?

294
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,854
        I was just sayin'
         what I thought.

295
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,989
And isn't that why you
wanted me to be a judge?

296
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,057
For my honesty?

297
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,457
                   Of course.

298
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,095
            But you said fashion
               is ridiculous!

299
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,230
      But it's my opinion!

300
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,731
     And I'm not gonna lie!

301
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:01,655
Oh!

302
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,201
          Come with me!

303
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:10,975
           Oh, heh heh, Rarity!

304
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,744
      What a nice surprise!

305
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,114
    Hello Strawberry Sunrise,
       this is Applejack.

306
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,049
  I was wondering if you could
      tell her how you feel

307
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,084
          about apples?

308
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:20,718
                 Don't like 'em!

309
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,387
           What? Why?

310
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,256
    They're crunchy, they're
    sweet, they're delicious.

311
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,358
    They're not strawberries.

312
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:30,393
You're right.

313
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,298
Apples are better
than strawberries.

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,001
  Only if by "better" you mean
  "better at being disgusting."

315
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,904
     You'd better apologize!

316
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,404
        Oh, I'm sorry...

317
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:43,441
     that you actually bite
      into those tasteless,

318
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,009
   mealy, worm-filled things.

319
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:45,433
Oh..

320
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:48,146
              What!?

321
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,182
Applejack!

322
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,450
Why are you so angry?

323
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,186
It's just Strawberry's
honest opinion.

324
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,222
What's wrong with that?

325
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,257
      Well, that's fine if
      she doesn't like 'em,

326
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,193
   but if she knew how hard we
work to make our apples perfect,

327
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:06,965
    maybe she wouldn't be so
     mean about it--Oooooh.

328
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,099
            Oh, boy.

329
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,434
            Mmm-hmm.

330
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,135
 Doesn't feel so good, does it?

331
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,403
               No.

332
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,439
     No, it does not at all.

333
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,909
          I am so sorry, Rarity.

334
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,478
           I got so carried away
            with bein' honest,

335
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,581
   I guess I didn't think about
   how I was makin' others feel.

336
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,117
        I'm a real rotten apple.

337
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,486
I appreciate that, Applejack.

338
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,620
        That means a lot.

339
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,289
I just wish you'd realized it

340
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,357
before you ruined
the fashion show!

341
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,365
I need to get some of these.

342
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,033
    It's the only way to travel.

343
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,738
       What are you doing!?

344
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,073
          Canterlot is that way..

345
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,410
    Yep, but you're not goin'
     back to Canterlot yet.

346
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:55,847
              Hey!

347
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,581
         What is she...

348
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,083
   I don't know.

349
00:16:59,285 --> 00:16:59,851
                          Run!

350
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:11,562
         Listen, y'all.

351
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,564
         I thought I was
        just bein' honest

352
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,764
  when I said all those things,

353
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,603
 but somepony helped me realize
  I was actually bein' hurtful.

354
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,440
    So for that, I apologize.

355
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,677
       So, you don't think
     fashion is ridiculous?

356
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,448
    Well... I... still don't
         understand it,

357
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,384
    but I appreciate how much
        it means to y'all

358
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,553
        and how much hard
      work you put into it.

359
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,723
    I also know this contest
     is important to Rarity.

360
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,291
So what do you say?

361
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:46,130
      I'd hate to have come
        all this way here

362
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,166
        and not see what
           you can do.

363
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,501
If they're judging, we're in.

364
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,102
      Under one condition.

365
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,204
           Literally.

366
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,405
            Anything.

367
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,474
                     Untie us.

368
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,018
     Show's back on, fellas!

369
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,325
               Ah!

370
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,043
                  Uh uh.

371
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,452
                  Uh huh!

372
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,728
 ... and then Applejack found me
   and told me to distract you

373
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,162
 for an hour but the hour's up!

374
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:52,897
             Ta da!

375
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,833
           B-b-but... how?

376
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,268
    They were all leaving...

377
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,170
    This was all coming down.

378
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:00,870
    You can thank Applejack.

379
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,870
        She lit'rally did
       it all by herself.

380
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:05,543
  I don't think that word means
    what you think it means.

381
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:10,015
But I did bust my tail because I
know how much this means to you.

382
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,316
       Ohh!

383
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,851
Thank you, Applejack.

384
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,519
          We start now!

385
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,658
      First up, Lily Lace!

386
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,300
           Starstreak!

387
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,410
           Inky Rose!

388
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,720
   And now it's time to vote.

389
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,723
    I am drawn to the beauty
      and drama of fashion

390
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,993
     and no pony does drama
     better than Lily Lace!

391
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,428
       So I vote for her.

392
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,300
   It means soooo much to me,
    I literally can't even...

393
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,804
Simplicity is the
keynote of true elegance.

394
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,675
That is why I vote
for Inky Rose.

395
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,712
        You've made me so.. happy?

396
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,015
       Fashion is the art!

397
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,052
        I, Photo Finish,
      vote for Starstreak!

398
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,254
     Wonderful to hear, darling.

399
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,790
           Well, it all comes
         down to you, Applejack.

400
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,426
    Pinkie Pie: Can you believe it!?

401
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,294
        After everything
        that's happened,

402
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,062
        Applejack is the
         deciding vote!

403
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,164
    Ah! This is so exciting!

404
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,101
        Well, Applejack?

405
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:42,473
            Uh, uh...

406
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,377
  Lily Lace's clothes go here,
    Inky Rose's will go there

407
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,212
and Starstreak's there.

408
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,748
           Sorry, but I couldn't
              pick just one.

409
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,283
              They all did great
              and in my opinion,

410
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,885
        they all deserve to win.

411
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,085
          And I agree.

412
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,656
   I told you your perspective
      would be beneficial.

413
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,426
       Is.. this one of your
      new designs, Rarity?

414
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,561
           It's, uh...

415
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,464
  the form is reminiscent of...

416
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,700
       I mean, it conjures
         up images of...

417
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,102
       Well, uh..I mean...

418
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,102
            Oh, that?

419
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:16,040
          No, I totally
          messed that one up.

420
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,341
          It's ghastly.

421
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,375
             Horrid.

422
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,144
      Absolutely terrible!

423
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,446
             Oh, thank goodness.

424
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,550
             Cause in my honest
              opinion, it's awful.

425
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,555
Rarity: When you're right,
 you're right!
