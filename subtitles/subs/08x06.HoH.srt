1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:05,905
       Princess Twilight!

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,758
         WE'RE GLOWING!

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,010
  [giggle] That's what happens
  when you're summoned by the map.

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:13,545
   Somepony needs our help?

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,747
 We're being called by the map?

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,483
  Did I mention we're glowing?

7
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,956
      So where exactly in
    Equestria are we needed?

8
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:26,859
  Actually, where you're going
    isn't even in Equestria.

9
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:31,063
           Wow. That's almost...
            off the table!

10
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,065
       But.. what's way out there?

11
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,366
           Mt. Aris.

12
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,035
  The home of the Hippogriffs.

13
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,970
And that's where you're headed.

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,472
           Whooaaaa.

15
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,051
You really don't need to
come with us, Twilight!

16
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,554
 We can take care of this
mission just fine on our own!

17
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,488
   Mm-hm!

18
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,656
        Scootaloo: YEAH!

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:32,958
              Ugh!

20
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,697
                  I know that.

21
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,232
But I'm not so sure the ponies

22
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,733
who care about you
want you going off

23
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:42,935
so far on your own.

24
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,170
        Besides, there's
      some school business

25
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,906
      I need to take care
        of on Mt. Aris.

26
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,310
      This permission slip
      is for Silverstream.

27
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,712
  It's very important that her
   mother and father sign it,

28
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,848
    or else no field trips!

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,618
Sounds like somepony
just wants a vacation.

30
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:04,089
     OK, yes, I have been
   wanting to visit Mt. Aris

31
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,891
     ever since the
    Hippogriffs moved back.

32
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,460
   But it's... purely research.

33
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,896
   Silverstream's brother is
    going to meet us there,

34
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,298
  and take us to their houses.

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,365
              Wow!

36
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,401
 They have more than one house?

37
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,553
          I guess so.

38
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:18,704
  The social structure of the
   Hippogriffs and Seaponies

39
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,272
     is a bit of a mystery.

40
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,707
          All aboard!

41
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,509
Last stop, the new
Mt. Aris station!

42
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,559
      I don't know if I'd
    like being a Hippogriff.

43
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,928
    Part bird, part pony...

44
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,665
    I'm happy with just
     my pony parts, thanks.

45
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:48,167
      I think Hippogriffs
       are pretty neat.

46
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,135
      I learned all about
      them from Applejack.

47
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,073
    The Hippogriffs all once
  lived happily on Mt. Aris...

48
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,975
        but when the
      Storm King invaded,

49
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:58,944
    they used a Magic Pearl
    to turn into Sea Ponies

50
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,381
 and escaped to the underwater
   safety of Seaquestria.

51
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,451
      Then, in the Battle
       of Canterlot,

52
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,453
    when Applejack defeated
      the Storm King.

53
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,489
   Twilight: Wait, what? She
   told you SHE defeated him?

54
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:11,624
          By herself?

55
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:15,294
       Uh. Maybe she didn't
       say that exactly,

56
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,229
       but it makes for a
       better story.

57
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,766
     Conductor: Final stop,
       Mt. Aris station!

58
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,335
          Huh!

59
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:45,190
All right. So what kind of cutie
mark-related friendship problem

60
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,692
       do you think we're
       supposed to solve?

61
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,461
 I don't know, but hippogriffs
    don't HAVE cutie marks,

62
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,997
 so it might not have anything
  to do with that at all.

63
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,703
 Huh. Still the map called us,

64
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:01,272
so it must be a kind of problem
 that only we can solve!

65
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,677
         GO CRUSADERS!

66
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,180
  But how do we know exactly
  who we're supposed to help?

67
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,849
             AHEM!

68
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,918
       Attention, please!

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,153
 Anygriff here have a problem?

70
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,596
       Eh. That's all I got.

71
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,597
   Maybe if the map could be

72
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,666
     a little more specific
       about our mission?

73
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,835
     Like maybe an address?

74
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,137
     The map doesn't
     really work like that.

75
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,206
     But I'm sure you, and
      whoever needs help,

76
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,541
     will find each other.

77
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,384
        Excuse me, Miss
      Sparkle? Over here!

78
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,685
        Sorry I'm late.

79
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,353
  I'm Silverstream's brother.

80
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,255
           Terramar.

81
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,324
    A Hippogriff can have a
    Sea Pony for a brother?

82
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,326
  How does that work, exactly?

83
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,028
     Sssh! It's rude to ask
     a question like that!

84
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,632
             Whoa!

85
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,770
         Can I ask now?

86
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,939
     Heh. It is kind of strange.

87
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,374
      See, after the Storm
       King was defeated,

88
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,443
     the Sea Ponies didn't
     have to hide anymore.

89
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,278
    So some of them changed
     back to Hippogriffs

90
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,813
   and went home to Mt. Aris.

91
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,715
     But others got used to
     living under the water

92
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,451
   and stayed in Seaquestria.

93
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:22,287
     And me, well, I kind
     of go back and forth.

94
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,255
           With this.

95
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,958
       It's a tiny piece
      of the Magic Pearl.

96
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,826
        It was split up
      among our kingdoms.

97
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,629
      Cool!

98
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:32,664
   Well, I'm pretty eager to
  see the Hippogriff village.

99
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:37,303
  You know, to get this form
  signed, and research, so...

100
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,739
Hey Terramar, does anygriff you
 know up there have a problem

101
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,107
      they need help with?

102
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,842
     [chuckle] On Mt. Aris?

103
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,378
       No, everygriff is
     pretty happy up there.

104
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,981
  It's a great place to live.

105
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,290
             Whoa!

106
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,359
      This looks amazing!

107
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,694
     Last time I was here,
     it was a ghost town!

108
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,896
Yeah! Queen Novo thought
it was important

109
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,433
to return our village
to its former glory.

110
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,780
      And now, I
      officially open

111
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,284
    the "Glad to Be A Hippogriff
       Festival!"

112
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,049
      Wow! We picked a
      good day to show up!

113
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,450
Not really.

114
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,486
We do this every weekend.

115
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,588
    Hippogriffs REALLY
    like being hippogriffs.

116
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,129
                 Heh. There's my boy!

117
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,530
  Hi, Dad!

118
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,633
Haven't seen you
in days, Son!

119
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,335
Wish you'd come
around more often.

120
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,938
           Oh, Dad, these are
          Silverstream's friends

121
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,872
                from Equestria,
               they came up to--

122
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,709
[gasp] Princess Twilight Sparkle!

123
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,681
     Attention, Everygriff!

124
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,084
       Princess Twilight
       Sparkle is here!

125
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,553
 She's Silverstream's teacher!

126
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,729
Here to take in the marvel that
 is Mt. Aris, Your Highness?

127
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,198
          Absolutely!

128
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,534
     And to have you sign a
     form for Silverstream.

129
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,636
      Glad to! But first,
    let's show the princess

130
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,239
       some real Mt. Aris
        hospitality.

131
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,809
    To the refreshment tent,
  for a stein of salmon juice!

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,347
  Eh! Research! See you later!

133
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,282
         And good luck!

134
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,017
I know you'll find your mission!

135
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,888
 Well, your dad's
certainly...outgoing, isn't he?

136
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,056
He's a great guy.

137
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,757
All my relatives are nice.

138
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,658
 That's kind of the problem...

139
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,693
          Wait, stop!

140
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,797
        What's that
        wonderful sound?

141
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,931
       Those are the
      Harmonizing Heights.

142
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,366
       Legend says that--

143
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,489
     WOOHOO! YEAH! AWESOME!
        I LOVE THIS!

144
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,059
Uh... is she OK?

145
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,729
       This is absolutely
