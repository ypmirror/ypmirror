00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,156
   I can't believe I thought
  somepony like <i>that</i>

422
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,661
       could show me how
        to be.. anything.

423
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:34,198
 [sigh] It must be hard growing up not
  really knowing who you are.

424
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
       That's the thing.

425
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:39,870
    I know exactly who I am,
    and how I got that way.

426
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:42,118
         [door opens]

427
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,343
         Um, Twilight?

428
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:48,780
        Oh. Hi. Where's
        your.. father?

429
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,115
           He's gone.

430
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,451
Turns out he wasn't what a real
dragon should be after all.

431
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,287
  He also wasn't my real dad.

432
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,324
    Oh, Spike... I'm so sorry.

433
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,993
    I'm the one who's sorry.

434
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,762
  You were just worried about
   me and I lost my temper.

435
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,565
       Sludge was just a
       great big phony.

436
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,234
I have to say, I'm not surprised.

437
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,171
  There's no way a dragon like
  that was related to you.

438
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,840
  But if you still want to
  search for your real family,

439
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,809
I'd understand if you spent
 more time in the Dragonlands.

440
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,044
       I don't think so.

441
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,947
       I already know who
       my <i>real</i> family is.

442
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,316
       Oooh! It's me, right?

443
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,019
            Mm hm! Besides...

444
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,922
There's no way I'm
 living without pillows.
