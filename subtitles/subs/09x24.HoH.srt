00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,141
when they're on a
creative roll!

141
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,344
With thread this exquisite,
can you blame them?

142
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,580
 Rainbow Dash: Weather for the
 coronation is sunny skies!

143
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,816
     It was weird, though.

144
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,552
Not many pegasi wanted to
help me clear the clouds.

145
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,420
They were kinda
on edge.

146
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:03,889
             [slam]

147
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,624
   They're not the only ones..

148
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,727
 It's the first shift in royal
 power in over a millennium!

149
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,296
            Of course, everypony
            is a little jumpy.

150
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,632
               Change does that.

151
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,435
 But I'm sure it's not because
 they're worried about YOU.

152
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,203
How could they be?

153
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,106
HOW many times have you
saved their flanks by now?

154
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,842
    You're right. I'll just
   have to let everypony know

155
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,744
    that even with
    Celestia and Luna gone,

156
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,545
     we'll make sure
     things stay the same.

157
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,753
Twilight! There you are!

158
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,521
You mind tellin' your friend
here that I don't need

159
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,790
       an official guard
       wherever I go?

160
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,393
    Especially if he ain't
    gonna help carry apples?

161
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,463
  I appreciate you taking such
    good care of my friends,

162
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,764
      but we're fine now.

163
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,736
 It was the strangest thing. He
 kept callin' me "Earth pony,"

164
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,172
   like I didn't have a name!

165
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,874
  And watchin' me like he
 thought I'd steal the silver!

166
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,309
      [crash and clatter]

167
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,279
   Do NOT go in that kitchen!

168
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,813
      You look like you
      were in a sugar war.

169
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,649
        For some reason,

170
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,252
    the bakers are SUPER
    grouchy with each other.

171
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,788
 That unicorn chef started
 throwing dessert at Mrs. Cake!

172
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,323
   I tried to help, but I got
   caught in the crossfire!

173
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,694
    Tasty, tasty crossfire...

174
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,195
            [slurp]

175
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,931
     You sure this is just
     pre-coronation nerves?

176
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:24,135
       Discord: Oh, my
      aching metatarsals!

177
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,440
   Y'know, you forget how
   convenient snap-travel is.

178
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,543
 Wait. Did you just
 WALK here? On foot?

179
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,280
   Yes, actually. And I have
   a confession to make.

180
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:39,884
   You see, I might have
   made the teeniest boo boo.

181
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,688
   All very well-intentioned
   and noble on my part, of course...

182
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,658
Get to the
point, Discord.

183
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,693
         You remember that whole
         thing with King Sombra?

184
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,264
  That was <i>slightly</i> my fault.
  And by slightly, I mean...

185
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,065
      I brought him back.

186
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,401
       You DID!? But why!?

187
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,837
     It seemed like a good
     idea at the time!

188
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,040
  Which is why I also brought
  back three other villains

189
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,276
   who are now on the loose...

190
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,378
       ..And not really big
        fans of yours.

191
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,648
         So... my bad.

192
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,915
       [horrified gasps]

193
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:15,854
        Luna: Let me get
        this straight.

194
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,989
     You wanted to boost
     Twilight's confidence,

195
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,559
 so you brought back Chrysalis,
 Cozy Glow, and Tirek

196
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,793
         to attack her?

197
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,294
      Don't forget Sombra!

198
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,531
     And while you united
     these three villains,

199
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,933
  YOU pretended to be Grogar?

200
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,438
   Discord! How could you do
   this to Twilight!? And us!?

201
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,476
Look what a great job
you did defeating Sombra!

202
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,744
All the confidence
you gained!

203
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,881
Remember the cheering?
The hoof bumps?

204
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,449
Except it was
 all a lie.

205
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,985
A well-intentioned lie!

206
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,853
     For all the time
     you've spent with us,

207
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,722
   you really haven't picked
   up too much in the way of

208
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,323
    friendship lessons, huh?

209
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,958
   You've been setting
   up challenges for us

210
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,394
    the whole time,
    haven't you?

211
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,496
  None of our successes
  were actually real!

212
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,230
                      Of course,
                      they were!

213
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,667
   You just had an <i>extremely</i>
   good-looking safety net.

214
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,903
    Spike: And how was that
    supposed to HELP again?

215
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,639
I intended to prepare
Twilight for anything

216
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,009
by orchestrating an epic
attack at her coronation.

217
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,144
       You beastly beast!

218
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,014
  Don't you know how much
  this day means to Twilight!?

219
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,149
   AND ME! I made her dress!

220
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,919
     Why wait until now for
     such a horrible plan?

221
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,155
  You don't take a final exam
  on your first day of class!

222
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,659
    Just think, after
    defeating THREE baddies,

223
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,928
        Twilight would
        HAVE to believe

224
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,231
     that she's the leader
     we all know she is!

225
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,302
     You have made a grave
     misjudgment, Discord..

226
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,905
   Do you have anything ELSE
   you would like to tell us?

227
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,008
    Would you like the good
    news or the bad news?

228
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,044
THAT wasn't the bad news!?

229
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:51,883
  All my chaos magic is... gone.
  Trapped in Grogar's bell.

230
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:54,319
           [sigh] So what's the good news?

231
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,255
     Chrysalis, Tirek, and
      Cozy Glow now have

232
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,124
        all of the real
        Grogar's magic.

233
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:03,762
        In what WORLD is
        that GOOD NEWS!?

234
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,797
       Compared to me
       losing my powers,

235
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,299
         anything else
         IS good news.

236
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,969
            Twilight, Luna, we
            need to make a plan.

237
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,805
Maybe it's not too late to stop
this DISASTER from happening.

238
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,309
      I... I need some
      time to think first.

239
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,078
  Well, there isn't any time!

240
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,913
     Look what I overheard
     them saying!

241
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:22,648
             [snap]

242
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,584
  Oh! Just listen to my voice
   and use your imagination.

243
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,489
    Let the fool go. Without
    magic, he's no threat.

244
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,626
    Besides, we have plans.

245
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,762
      The lame six are so
      busy being perfect,

246
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,398
   they haven't even noticed
   what we've been up to!

247
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,401
      Have I mentioned how
      great revenge is?

248
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:47,506
  I hope you got a name picked
  out for your future kingdom.

249
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:50,609
      Because it's time to
      destroy Equestria!

250
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,611
        [evil laughter]

251
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:59,718
 They're probably on their way
 to attack Canterlot.. right now!

252
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,586
      Then we'll stop 'em!

253
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:05,056
    HOW? Stopping Sombra by
    himself was hard enough!

254
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,558
   And that was with lord-of-
   chaos training wheels!

255
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,095
    Twilight, it doesn't
    matter if Discord set up

256
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,931
     your successes or not.

257
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,668
       WE believe in you..
       and always have.

258
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,604
   Lean on your strengths to
   counter your weaknesses.

259
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,005
         My strengths?

260
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,210
         Right. Spike!

261
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,945
  Send a letter to Starswirl.

262
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,481
Tell him we need the Pillars to
guard the border of Canterlot.

263
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,449
      <i> If the villains are</i>
      <i> coming for a fight,</i>

264
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,385
       <i> we'll have one</i>
       <i> waiting for them.</i>

265
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,521
 <i> With Chrysalis on the loose,</i>
 <i> she'll go after Starlight.</i>

266
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,690
       <i> Warn Cadance and</i>
        <i> Shining Armor.</i>

267
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,792
    <i> They're our final line</i>
    <i> of defense if we fail.</i>

268
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,929
  The ultimate battle for the
   fate of Equestria...

269
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,297
           is coming!

270
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,970
   We're not going anywhere
  until you two STOP ARGUING!

271
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,774
    Chrysalis, say something
    nice about Tirek.

272
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,543
GAH! He's...red.

273
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,078
                       Tirek...?

274
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,415
    She's...not as
    annoying as I expected.

275
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,886
   Good! Now we were talking
   about Grogar's Bell.

276
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,421
We should take the
magic inside it!

277
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,824
     You know how
     powerful Discord was.

278
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,560
      That much chaos
