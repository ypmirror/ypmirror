1
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,126
-Eyes over here, Spike!
-Uh, sorry.

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,364
For this to work, it's crucial we keep
our concentration totally on the...

3
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:17,095
Ooh!

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,869
Spike! This magic needs
our full attention to make it happen!

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,357
There's no other way.

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,482
I can't help it.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,876
Look!

8
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:41,120
Never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie.

9
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:43,549
Super extra Pinkie Pie today.

10
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,166
Twitchy-twitcha-twitcha-twitch.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,270
Pinkie Pie. What in the wide, wide
world of Equestria are you up to?

12
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:56,178
Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail!

13
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,621
It's a-twitchy-twitching!
And you know what that means.

14
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:02,277
Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.

15
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:05,819
The twitching means my Pinkie Sense is telling me
that stuff's gonna start falling!

16
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:07,703
You should better duck for cover.

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,267
Oh, Pinkie. It's not gonna rain.

18
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:11,993
Weather's barely even a cloud in the...

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,450
He just said "Nice catch" in Frog.

20
00:01:57,696 --> 00:02:00,705
Oh. I'm so, so sorry.

21
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:02,787
You okay, Twilight Sparkle?

22
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:06,521
I just couldn't stand to see
the pond getting so overpopulated...

23
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:09,119
...what with the frogs all
hopping into each other and all...

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,165
...so I decided to fly as many as I can
on over to Froggy Bottom Bog.

25
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,650
Of course you did.

26
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:15,850
Bye bye.

27
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:22,495
Um, Twilight? You've got a little
something on your face there.

28
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:26,069
Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense
tell you that too?

29
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:28,025
Nah, I could just see it.

30
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:35,542
Come on, Spike. Let's continue our practice
session where there's a little less commotion.

31
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:37,966
Wow! That was amazing!

32
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,601
Pinkie Pie predicted something
would fall and it did!

33
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:43,342
Oh, come on. She said something would fall...

34
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:46,695
...and a frog just happened to fall
right around the same time.

35
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:49,176
A coincidence. Nothing else to it.

36
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,475
My tail! My tail! Twitcha-twitch! Twitcha-twitch!

37
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,524
Something else is gonna fall!

38
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,447
Oh, Pinkie, please.

39
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:59,103
Nothing else is gonna faaaAAAH... Ugh!

40
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,434
Oh no! Twilight fell!

41
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:03,701
Is it... safe to go help her?

42
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,697
It's okay. My tail stopped twitching.

43
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,238
That was amazing!

44
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:13,787
Oh, please.

45
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:16,539
Uh, Twilight? Why are you hangin' out in a ditch?

46
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,778
Because Pinkie Pie predicted it.

47
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:21,050
Honestly, Spike, she did not.

48
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,084
Two coincidences in a row
like this may be unlikely...

49
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:28,008
...but it's still easier to believe than
twitchy tails that predict the future.

50
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,368
Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense?

51
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:36,697
Don't worry. It's safe.
Prediction already came true.

52
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:40,406
Oh, wait. Don't tell me
you believe in this stuff too.

53
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:44,179
I know it doesn't make much sense,
but those of us, who've been Ponyville a while...

54
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,243
...have learned over time that
if Pinkie's a-twitchin', you better listen.

55
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:50,815
My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!

56
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,167
What does that mean?!

57
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,393
I'll start a bath for you.

58
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:56,213
HUH?!

59
00:03:57,055 --> 00:04:00,998
A bath? This thing keeps on
getting more ridiculous by the minute.

60
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,804
So basically it works like this:

61
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:11,174
I get different little niggly feelings
and they mean different things.

62
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:14,407
Like when my back is itchy,
it means it's my lucky day!

63
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:18,678
And when my knee gets pinchy, that means
something scary is about to happen.

64
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:20,560
Is your knee pinchy now?

65
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:25,030
No. But my shoulder's achy.
That means there's an alligator in the tub.

66
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,327
How come your knee didn't get pinchy?!

67
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:33,447
That isn't just scary. It downright dangerous!

68
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:37,124
No, it's not, silly.
This is my pet alligator, Gummy.

69
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,100
He's got no teeth. See?

70
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:42,263
Okay, okay. I get it.

71
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:48,090
Well, I still don't believe
all this "special power" stuff.

72
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,008
It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

73
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,712
What's not to believe? You do magic.
What's the difference?

74
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:55,213
Huge!

75
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:56,169
For one thing...

76
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,842
Magic is something you study and practice.

77
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,904
It only happens when you decide to do it.

78
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:08,910
And it's meant to make something specific,
that you choose to happen, happen.

79
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,688
With you... it makes no sense at all!

80
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,838
That so not true, Twilight.

81
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:18,352
Sometimes it's a *bunch* of random things
happening to my body...

82
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:20,678
...at random times that
supposedly predict the future.

83
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,482
I call them combos.

84
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,722
Combos?

85
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,616
Sure! You know, like ear flop,
then knee twitch, then eye flutter?

86
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:31,575
That means the sky is about to
be graced with a beautiful rainbow!

87
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:32,933
Yeah. Sure.

88
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:35,342
Uh-oh. I feel a combo coming on.

89
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:38,683
Ear flop... Eye flutter... Knee twitch...

90
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:48,760
You said that combo meant beautiful rainbow.

91
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:53,106
Oh, nonononono. You're thinking of an ear flop,
then knee twitch, then eye flutter.

92
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:56,117
This was an ear flop,
then eye flutter, then knee twitch.

93
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:58,486
That usually means "Look out for opening doors."

94
00:05:58,865 --> 00:05:59,875
You okay?

95
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,274
I don't believe this.

96
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,381
You don't believe, because you don't understand.

97
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:17,699
Okay. Now when you get another twitch...

98
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,314
...we'll have all kinds of scientific information.

99
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:22,158
Okie dokie lokie!

100
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,198
Any twitches yet?

101
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,742
Nopie dopie!

102
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,268
Now? Anything?

103
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:38,611
Wait! Hold on...

104
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:41,194
Uh, no.

105
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:45,471
Are you kidding me?
After a whole day of nonstop twitching...

106
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,231
...now that I've got you all hooked up,
you're not getting a single one?

107
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:50,712
I don't control it. They just come and go.

108
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:52,017
That makes no sense!

109
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,170
Sometimes you just have to believe in things.

110
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:55,918
Even when you can't figure 'em out.

111
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,263
I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.

112
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:02,796
Wait! Hold on... I'm feeling something.

113
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,083
Omygosh! What? What is it?

114
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:08,432
It's my tummy!

115
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,819
That usually means I'm hungry. Let's eat!

116
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:12,755
You know what?

117
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,389
Just forget it.

118
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,402
I don't need to know if this is real or not.

119
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,890
I don't need to understand it. I don't even care!

120
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,259
Okie dokie lokie!

121
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:30,502
Uh-oh!

122
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,247
Pinkie, have you seen Twili...?

123
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,275
Uh-huh.

124
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,729
Twilight? What are you doing back there?

125
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,634
Did you two plan this?

126
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,930
Plan what?

127
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:54,775
This is ridiculous! This can't be happening!
This makes no sense!

128
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,315
I have to figure this out.

129
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,286
Twilight?

130
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:40,226
Honestly, Spike, don't you know better
than to sneak up on ponies?

131
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,869
Oh! Sorry, but...

132
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,333
Um... Well... Isn't that what you're doing?

133
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:47,792
No.

134
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,598
I'm doing scientific research.

135
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:56,824
I'm observing Pinkie Pie (scientific name:
Pinkius Piecus) in its natural habitat.

136
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,780
Pinkius Whoecus?

137
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:03,129
There's something fishy going on
with the whole twitchy prediction thing.

138
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,133
And I'm getting to the bottom of it.

139
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:06,624
So shhh!

140
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:11,604
Come on! Pinkius Piecus is on the move.

141
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:21,260
Itchy nose.

142
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:29,350
Aha! That makes no sense.

143
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,218
See? She's hiding like something's
about to fall from the sky...

144
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:36,404
...but a twitchy *tail* means something's
gonna fall from the sky. Not an itchy nose.

145
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:43,590
This proves, perhaps conclusively, that...

146
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:46,706
Spike! Where are you going?

147
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,821
I'm trying to teach you
the value of scientific obse...

148
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,303
What's she doing now?

149
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,840
Smelling a flower.

150
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,488
Holy guacamole! I don't know what that means.

151
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,725
Probably that the flower smells good.

152
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:05,245
Wait! I'm getting something.

153
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:08,639
Ear flop... eye flutter... knee twitch.

154
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:09,885
Hold on...

155
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:13,582
You told me that's the combo
that says "Watch out for opening doors."

156
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:18,495
You really, really believe this stuff, don't you?

157
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:21,862
Here. Let me show you
there's nothing to be afraid of.

158
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:23,192
You see?

159
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,711
I promise you there's nothing
to fear from that... whoaaa...!

160
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,017
Twilight! You came to visit
my new apple cellar. How nice.

161
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:36,609
Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?

162
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,832
Here. Let me help ya.

163
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,264
Okay.

164
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:45,897
Take this down.

165
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:48,234
Twitchy... tail.

166
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:49,738
Twitchy tail?

167
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:51,486
TWITCHY TAIL!!!

168
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,827
Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie
know we're here, remember?

169
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,883
Something's gonna fall! Something's gonna fall!

170
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:57,902
Run for your lives!

171
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:02,028
Ugh... Spike, honestly, you're overreact...

172
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,980
Hey, Applejack! Whatchu doin'?

173
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,185
Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar.
How about you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?

174
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,525
Oh. Letting Twilight secretly follow me
all day without me knowing.

175
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:24,790
You mean you knew all along?!

176
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,661
Why didn't you tell me?

177
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:29,676
Silly. That would have spoiled the secret.

178
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:33,860
Tail... still twitching?

179
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:37,706
All done. Clear skies from here on in,
as far as I can tell.

180
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,626
Oh no! What does that one mean?!

181
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,188
Dunno. Never gotten any like it before.

182
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:47,399
But whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy!

183
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,825
Something you never expect
to happen is gonna happen!

184
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:56,636
And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bog!

185
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,132
That's where Fluttershy's headed!

186
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:01,110
Oh no! Is it about her?

187
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:03,250
I... I'm not sure.

188
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,434
We better go and make sure she's okay.

189
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,713
Calm down, everypony. All we know right now...

190
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:12,232
...is that Pinkie Pie just got
a case of the shivers. That's all.

191
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,157
Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff.

192
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,606
I don't.

193
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:26,834
I just want to be there to see the look on
Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.

194
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:28,127
Okie dokie!

195
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:51,464
Cold?

196
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:53,230
Need a jacket or something?

197
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:55,149
No, thanks. I'm fine.

198
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:59,438
So... what do you think happened to Fluttershy?

199
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,646
I hope nothin'.

200
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:03,030
I know, but... what do you *think* happened?

201
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:04,629
I'm tryin' not to think about it.

202
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:06,591
Me too.

203
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,421
But... I'm thinking about it anyway.

204
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:12,538
Like... what if... she exploded?!

205
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:15,354
Just exploded? For no reason?

206
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,697
Yeah! Like, boom!

207
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:19,776
-Whoa!
-I know!

208
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:24,646
What if... What if she exploded...
and then... and then exploded again?!

209
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,238
Can you do that? Can you explode twice?

210
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:28,685
Of course not.

211
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:32,767
But what if... she exploded...
and exploded again... and then...

212
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,150
Will you two stop?

213
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,544
She's fine. I'm sure of it.

214
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,323
I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake.

215
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:43,247
Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bog!

216
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:48,402
Fluttershy!

217
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,421
Fluttershy!

218
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,458
Fluttershy! You're okay!

219
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:03,625
Of course.

220
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:05,761
What a relief.

221
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,932
I'm so glad everything's all right.

222
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,930
Sorry. I know it's not nice to gloat, but...

223
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:15,580
AHA! I told you there was nothing
to worry about and I was right.

224
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:20,372
Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering
about was a *cough* doozy. And... *cough*

225
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:24,048
And the only *cough* doozy here is how right I am.

226
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:26,810
Um... Twilight?

227
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,396
Pinkie's made a lot of predictions
today, but... *cough*

228
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,373
What is that smell?!

229
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:36,365
But what we've shown here is that
there's no point in believing... *cough*

230
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,888
...anything you can't see for yourself.

231
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:42,741
W-Well then, see what's b-behind you, Twilight.

232
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:48,144
I see it... but I don't believe it!

233
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:54,115
Is that a hydra?

234
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,136
Who cares? RUUUN!!!

235
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:02,724
Pinkie! Come on!

236
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,105
Oh! I'm so sorry.

237
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,383
Everypony up that hill!

238
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:36,093
HEEELP!!!

239
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,683
Coming, Spike! Hang on!

240
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:52,049
I think we're gonna make it!

241
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,204
But Pinkie's still shuddering!

242
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:59,027
Oh, lookie there. It stopped.

243
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,413
Ohhh, therrre ittt isss agggainnn!

244
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,706
He'll be up here in no time!

245
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:19,372
Quick! One at a time! Cross!

246
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,319
Uh, do you know any spell
for turning a hydra into a mouse?

247
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,891
-No.
-How about a squirrel?

248
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:26,870
-No!
-How about...

249
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,104
No small rodents of any kind!

250
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:30,233
That's too bad.

251
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:32,675
A hop, skip and a...

252
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:33,753
JUMP!

253
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:38,971
Wwwhoooa!

254
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:42,925
He's too close!

255
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,975
I'll distract him. You two go! Now!

256
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:50,389
Oh... What would a brave pony
like Rainbow Dash do?

257
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,174
CHAAARGE!!!

258
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:08,722
Tttwilight!

259
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:37,102
Tttwilight!

260
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,608
You have to jump!

261
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,157
I'll never make it!

262
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,409
You'll be fine!

263
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,164
I will not!

264
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:50,084
It's your only hooope!

265
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,355
You have to take a leap of faith!

266
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:05,947
No!

267
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:11,783
Oh no!

268
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,270
NOOO!!!

269
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:27,553
I knew you could do it, Twilight!

270
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:31,356
I don't know how it happened.
Coincidence, dumb luck or what.

271
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,377
But you said there'd be a doozy
here at Froggy Bottom Bog...

272
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:37,308
...and I'd say we just had
ourselves one heck of a doozy.

273
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:38,991
I mean, that hydra...

274
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:41,660
Pinkie?

275
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:42,652
That wasn't it.

276
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,556
Huh?

277
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:45,027
What wasn't what?

278
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:47,230
What are you talkin' about, Pink?

279
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:49,009
The hydra wasn't the doozy.

280
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,669
I'm still getting the shudders.

281
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,880
You see? There it is again.

282
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:02,621
Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bog,
my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.

283
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:05,101
Huh... But I... WHAT?!

284
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,285
The hydra... wasn't the doozy?

285
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,191
How could it not be... the doozy?

286
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,161
What could be doozier than that?!

287
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,366
Dunno. But it just wasn't it.

288
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,458
I give up.

289
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,233
Give what up, Twi?

290
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:28,013
The fight. I can't fight it anymore.

291
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:31,079
I don't understand how, why or what...

292
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,183
...but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense.

293
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:36,878
I don't see how it does, but it just does.

294
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,849
Just because I don't understand
doesn't mean it's not true.

295
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,441
Yyyouuu mean yyyou bbbelllieve?

296
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,107
Yep. I guess I do.

297
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,624
Oh.

298
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,591
That was it! That's the doozy!

299
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,028
What?

300
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,421
What is?

301
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:00,974
You believing!

302
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:03,276
I never expected *that* to happen.

303
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:08,234
That was the doozy! Oh, and oh,
what a doozy of a doozy it was!

304
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,380
Oh, good, Spike. You're here.

305
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:19,447
Take a letter.

306
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:20,832
With pleasure, Twilight.

307
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,450
"Dear Princess Celestia."

308
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,328
"I'm happy to report, that..."

309
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:27,830
Spike. What have I been saying about focus?

310
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,400
I know, but I... well...

311
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:34,072
What's wrong, Spike? Never thought
you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?

312
00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:35,826
Not really. No.

313
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:38,439
Pinkie's tail's a-twitching. What else can I do?

314
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,458
"I am happy to report that I now realize..."

315
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:49,634
"...there are wonderful things
in this world you just can't explain."

316
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:52,580
"But that doesn't necessarily
make them any less true."

317
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:56,070
"It just means you have to
choose to believe in them."

318
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:59,165
"And sometimes it takes a friend
to show you the way."

319
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,518
HONK!

320
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:01,651
"Honk."

321
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:04,691
"Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

322
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,096
There it goes again.

323
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:13,802
I wonder what's gonna drop out
of the sky this time.

324
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,048
You never know.

325
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:22,648
Twitchy tail?

326
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:27,541
Holy guacamole!

327
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,166
