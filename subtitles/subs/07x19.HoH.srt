00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,690
  I'm just glad that I have all
    of you to remind me that

419
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,660
   even if I accidentally use
     magical remover potion

420
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,362
     on my mane, I can look
       good on the outside

421
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,831
     as long as I feel good
         on the inside.

422
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,035
How did you end up using remover
potion on your head anyway?

423
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,838
             [gasp] Pinkie!

424
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,607
      If I had the remover
     potion this whole time,

425
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,742
        that means Pinkie
         must have the--

426
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,479
        WHHHEEEEEEEEE!!! [giggling]

427
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,080
            Shampoo.

428
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,348
Shampoo?

429
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,151
Wow, that explains why our manes
   are all so bouncy and soft.

430
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:24,775
                ♪♪

431
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,626
   Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the
  rest of that remover potion.

432
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:29,595
             Great!

433
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,598
Hey! Is there something
different about you?

434
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,065
New hoof polish?

435
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,136
         So you're sure?

436
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,970
        You're sure it's
        fully recovered.

437
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,106
 Yes, Rarity, it's been months.

438
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,074
      Your mane looks fine.

439
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,146
          Ooooh, look!

440
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,849
It's the Most Beautiful Manes In
 Equestria issue of Vanity Mare.

441
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,284
You should read it.

442
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,787
         Oh, honestly, Pinkie,
       after all I went through,

443
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,824
    I'm not sure it even matters
     what mane graces the pag--

444
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:00,992
READ IT!

445
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,596
    But.. I canceled the shoot.

446
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,666
      We had a little talk
       with Photo Finish.

447
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,902
And explained just how beautiful
      we thought you were -

448
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,772
                 inside and out.

449
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,107
     While you were shining
      from the inside out,

450
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,944
        Photo Finish took
         a few pictures.

451
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,648
    I don't know what to say.

452
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,350
Luckily, you don't
have to say anything.

453
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,053
Your style speaks for itself.

454
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,322
         [laughter]
