1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,206
    I thought Pinkie Pie said
     to get here right away.

2
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:09,942
   She sure had a burr in her
    britches about something.

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:11,377
        So, where is she?

4
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:15,280
       Pfft. Yeah. What is
       taking her so long?

5
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,849
         [giggle]
          Just kidding.

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,351
  You guys really need to look
   behind you once in a while.

7
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,820
    Uh, Pinkie, you said you
     had something important

8
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:22,621
           to tell us.

9
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,990
         Not telling so
        much as showing.

10
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,059
        In fact, what
       you're about to see

11
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,728
 may SHAKE the very foundations
   of your perception

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,396
          for all time!

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,633
                Um...a cupcake?

14
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,602
         YES! But wait!
         There's more!

15
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,639
       It's an invitation
         to visit

16
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,175
       the Cheese Sandwich
       Amusement Factory!

17
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,144
        Cheese Sandwich
        opened a factory?

18
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:48,280
Heh. What do they make
there? Rubber chickens?

19
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,316
     That's ridiculous. They
      make <i>way</i> more there

20
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:52,937
        than just rubber
         chickens!

21
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:56,321
Gosh, Cheese hardly
seems the factory type.

22
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,724
    I just assumed he'd
  continue to wander Equestria

23
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:02,094
  throwing parties. Still, you
   must be excited to see him.

24
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,397
   I am! I can't wait to tour
   his factory, catch up,

25
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,733
   have him tell me my life's
   purpose, swap gag tips...

26
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,335
               Whoa-whoa-whoa.
               What did you say?

27
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:12,037
      Uh, catch up? I mean,
      it has been a while.

28
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,939
      I think Applejack's
      asking about the part

29
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,575
    about Cheese Sandwich
    and your life's purpose?

30
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:21,046
  Oh, that. Yeah. It's just all
  of you have found your thing.

31
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,681
      You're going to rule
        all of Equestria.

32
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,882
         Rainbow Dash is
          a Wonderbolt.

33
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,450
       Fluttershy has her
        animal sanctuary.

34
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,852
    Rarity has her boutiques.

35
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,722
     Applejack has that
      hat... and the farm,

36
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,158
        so that's, like,
       TWO things!

37
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,861
     I don't even have one.

38
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,800
 When I first got Cheese's
 invite, I was a little jealous.

39
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,069
        It felt like even
        he was moving on

40
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,337
          to bigger and
          better things

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,173
        and everypony was
       leaving me behind.

42
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,842
   But then I realized Cheese
   Sandwich is a party pony

43
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,977
          just like me!

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,815
 If he figured out his purpose,
 he can help me figure out mine!

45
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,751
    I think talking to Cheese
    Sandwich is a great idea,

46
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,886
        but the only pony

         boring-looking

   Oh, look. A pretty flower.

The squirting
flower's a classic.

93
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,320
Ohhh! What if the flower
was part of a shirt,

94
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:24,056
but the flower didn't
squirt; the shirt did!

Your fresh take on
our classic gags

273
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,941
rivals Mr. Sandwich
in his prime.

274
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,010
        I need to find my
         life's purpose,

275
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,611
but I don't
think that's it.

276
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,812
I'm a party pony!

277
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,349
      I need to make ponies
       happy in real time!

278
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:48,353
   Ah, yes. In our early days,
  nothing brought Mr. Sandwich

279
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,488
  more pleasure than seeing the
  laughter his gags brought

280
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,856
      to ponies first hoof.

281
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,259
       Guess it's back to
       the drawing board.

282
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,528
     Well, there will always
     be a place for you here

283
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,630
    if you change your mind.

284
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,831
Hold on. What did
you just say?

285
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,867
                There'll always
                be a place for you here?

286
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,368
   No-no-no-no. Before that.

287
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,736
                  Back to the
                  drawing board?

288
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,238
That was me!

289
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,507
          Nothing brought Mr.
          Sandwich more pleasure

290
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,175
        than seeing the laughter
        his gags brought

291
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,477
           to ponies first hoof?

292
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,813
   YES! That! We've been going
    about this all wrong!

293
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,948
We don't need to
make Cheese laugh.

294
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,184
HE needs to make US laugh!

295
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,323
   Cheese! I figured it out!
   I know why you can't laugh!

296
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:26,991
           What? Why?

297
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,027
    You started this factory
     because you didn't want

298
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,628
to disappoint
smiling faces,

299
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,963
but in here you
can't see any!

300
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,567
      It does make a
       certain sense, sir.

301
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,170
     Spreading laughter has
     always brought you joy.

302
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,273
    But spreading laughter is
     what this factory does.

303
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,109
    Except you don't SEE it.

304
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,844
You're a party pony like me.

305
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,747
You need to make
ponies smile in person!

306
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,886
Here! Just try it!

307
00:15:55,388 --> 00:16:00,824
      OK... Um, why did Boneless 2
        cross the road?

308
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,663
     To prove to Boneless
     1 he wasn't a chicken.

309
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:10,835
Very funny sir. Excellent
joke. Oh! I mean, Ha. Ha, ha?

310
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:11,836
             Really..?

311
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,139
Sorry. Not much of a laugher.

312
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:18,643
Here. Try me. I
promise I'll laugh!

313
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,279
        Pinkie, you laugh
         at everything.

314
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,781

          you're doing,

315
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:27,651

     laws, er, a lost cause.

     I-I'm sorry. But when
     you swapped the letters

00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,827

      it was just a bit...

                    ...Funny?

00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,706
     And then I said goodbye,
     and then I came here!

406
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,475
     Oh, and then I gathered
       you all together

407
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,911
     and started telling you
    about it. First, I said-

408
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,347
Well, that sounds
like quite a trip!

409
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,983
    And Cheese Sandwich just
     left his own factory?

410
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,286
        Yep. But I think
       Sans Smirk's hooves

411
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,154
      were the perfect
      ones to leave it in.

412
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,323
    As much as Cheese was
    born to wander Equestria

413
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,824
         and make ponies
        laugh in person,

414
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,461
        Sans was born to
        run that factory.

415
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,195
        And you don't so
        sound so worried

416
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,265
     about finding your
     life's purpose anymore.

417
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,701
 Nope! I figured out Cheese and
  I are pretty much the same.

418
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,804
   We both need to see ponies
   laughing to feel fulfilled.

419
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,039
     And I already do that.

420
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:18,209
    My life is purposing
   itself all over the place!

421
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,844
                      [chuckle] I agree
                     completely.

422
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,180
        Thanks. Oh, I
         almost forgot!

423
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,549
     I got you all a little
     something from my trip.

424
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,885
    Who likes peanut brittle..?
