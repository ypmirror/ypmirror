00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:56,170
When Twilight and her
friends defeated me,

353
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,245
I chose to run away and seek
revenge. You don't have to.

354
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:03,215
You can be the leader
your subjects deserve.

355
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:13,275
There is no revenge you
could ever conceive of

356
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:15,850
that will come close to
what I will exact upon you

357
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,555
one day, Starlight Glimmer!

358
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,755
Thorax, as the new leader
of the Changelings,

359
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,925
I look forward to discussing how
we can improve our relationship

360
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,945
in the future.

361
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,590
However, for the moment,
perhaps it is best

362
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,460
that we leave the Changeling
Kingdom to the Changelings.

363
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:42,820
[poof]

364
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:45,415
Splendid idea!
Now who's ready

365
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,245
for some celebratory
tea at Fluttershy's?

366
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,045
Oh. Um. Everypony?

367
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:55,355
Actually, now that you
can snap your claws

368
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,455
and send us absolutely
anywhere again,

369
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,730
I think I have a
better option.

370
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,270
Uh.. Hey Starlight.
What are you doing here?

371
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,450
You left in such
a hurry before,

372
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,840
we kinda thought you
didn't want to come.

373
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:15,005
Yeah. I guess after the way I
used my magic on all of you,

374
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,405
I wasn't sure I was somepony
who should even be in charge

375
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:20,645
of a baking contest. I was
afraid I might go back

376
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,950
to being the pony I
used to be. But...

377
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,935
...I realized that sometimes
you don't have a choice.

378
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:32,090
You have to step up. And I
HAVE changed. I can handle it.

379
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:34,855
Whether than means saving
Equestria OR helping friends

380
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:38,370
with a sunset festival.
Speaking of which...

381
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:42,370
...I know the festival is almost
over, but I kinda invited

382
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:44,745
a few of my
friends to join.

383
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,690
Hope that's OK.

384
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:51,885
Are you kidding? Of course!

385
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:55,100
Great. Now, where's
that baking contest?

386
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,350
This pony needs a cupcake!

387
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,830
So I'm able to rip the very
fabric of reality again.

388
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,920
Yeah, yeah and I'm
still a self-absorbed,

389
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,200
below-average
illusionist. Right?

390
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,400
Actually, I was going to say
a COUPLE of those illusions

391
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,610
were slightly above average.

392
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,330
If you ever need a little chaos
in your act, let me know.

393
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,865
Ha! When pigs fly!

394
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,965
Your wish is my command!

395
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,995
[snap]

396
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,310
[squeal]

397
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:30,585
Whoa-whoaaaa!

398
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,905
Somepony is really gonna have to
catch us up on what we missed.
