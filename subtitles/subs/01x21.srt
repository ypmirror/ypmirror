1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,905
"And that's when the yellow birdie
thought to himself:"

2
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:20,438
"Hm... My favorite little tree
isn't such a little tree anymore."

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,359
"So she sang her song, big and strong."

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,004
"And they all lived in that great,
big tree happily ever after."

5
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:29,966
The End.

6
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,284
Applejack!

7
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:34,913
Were you reading a bedtime story to...

8
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:36,708
...an apple tree?

9
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:44,506
Well, you know, bein' replanted in a whole
new place is very upsettin' for a tree.

10
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:46,713
And Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.

11
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:49,734
No fair, Applejack!

12
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:52,903
You've got a luxurious private
sleeper cart for a TREE...!

13
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:56,675
...while I am crowded and cramped
in a same cart with all the other ponies.

14
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:59,274
How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?

15
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:02,218
But Bloomberg's the whole
reason we're makin' this trip.

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,285
He needs his rest so we can give him
as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.

17
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:09,678
You talk about it as if
it's your baby or something.

18
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:12,622
Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby!

19
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,048
Don't wet wittle Rarity make you all saddie-waddie.

20
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,459
Bloomber's a big and strong apple tree.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,516
Yes, he is. A coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo.

22
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:24,758
It's widdle Rarity, who's all saddie-waddie.

23
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,789
For crying out loud in the morning!

24
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:25,967
Do you guys mind?

25
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:29,808
I was up early fire-roasting those snacks
you're all eating and I pooped!

26
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,476
Speaking of, somebody's popcorn kernels didn't get popped.

27
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:35,476
Okay, fine.

28
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,111
Goodnight.

29
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,847
Maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye.

30
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:48,252
We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

31
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,427
Psst...! Pinkie Pie!

32
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:58,003
You asleep yet?

33
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,168
No. Are you asleep yet?

34
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:04,043
If I was sleeping, how could I
have asked you if you were asleep?

35
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:05,444
Oh yeah!

36
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:09,335
When we get to Appleloosa, you think
we'll have to carry that heavy tree...

37
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:10,931
...all the way from the train to the orchard?

38
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:12,823
What tree? You mean Bloomberg?

39
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,942
No. Fluttershy.

40
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,894
Fluttershy's not a tree, silly.

41
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:18,283
What's going on?

42
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,613
Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy is a tree.

43
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:22,235
I do NOT think she's a tree. I was just...

44
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,921
Did you say she was a tree?

45
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:26,329
No! Well... yes. But not exactly...

46
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,454
You know she's not a tree, right?

47
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:30,421
She's not a tree, Dashie.

48
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,076
I'd like to be a tree.

49
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:33,633
Oh, for Pete's sake!

50
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,741
Well, that was kinda huffy.

51
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,720
Huffy the Magic Dragon.

52
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:49,212
Could you all be quiet NOW?!

53
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,137
Bloomberg?

54
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,428
Bloomberg!

55
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,608
Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit.

56
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:01,726
Goodnight.

57
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,625
A buffalo stampede!

58
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:26,539
I just love their accessories.

59
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:29,416
They're getting awfully close to the train.

60
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:57,848
Ooh, looky!

61
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,397
Now they're going tricks!

62
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:08,625
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a backflip!

63
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:12,758
Or... just jump?

64
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:15,274
Hm...

65
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,201
Something tells me this isn't a circus act.

66
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:22,251
Hey there! Where are you headed in such a hurry?

67
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:30,176
Wow. You're pretty quick for someone so...

68
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,182
...bulky. No offense.

69
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,784
I just wanna know...

70
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:38,607
Hey!

71
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:41,683
I'm talking to you!

72
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:45,883
Wow...

73
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,614
I've got you now...

74
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:13,790
They've got Bloomberg!

75
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,255
Help!

76
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:18,787
And Spike!

77
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:26,451
Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her.

78
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:38,962
Hey there!

79
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:41,251
Welcome to AAAPPLELOOSA!

80
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,462
Braeburn, listen...

81
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:44,899
Hey, cousin Applejack. Mind your manners.

82
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,362
You have yet to introduce me
to your compadres. Shame on you.

83
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:50,504
Braeburn, listen. Somth'n terrible's happened...

84
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:53,565
Terrible is right. Your train is full seven minutes late.

85
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:57,288
That's seven minutes less for you to
delight in the pleasures and wonders of...

86
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,159
AAAPPLELOOSA!

87
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:05,896
Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built
all this in just a past year, don't it?

88
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:08,511
And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts.

89
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,280
Like horse-drawn carriages.

90
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,172
Okay, you pull now.

91
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,780
Eh, we just switched.

92
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:16,614
And now's there horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages.

93
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:21,784
Listen, Braeburn, I...

94
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:25,860
And here's our local waterin' hole:
The Salt Block.

95
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:27,236
That's enough salt for you!

96
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,506
Can't I at least get a glass of water?

97
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:37,317
Over there is the office of Sheriff Silverstar.

98
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:40,839
And here's where we have our wild west dances.

99
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,464
And here's where we have our mild west dances.

100
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:44,989
But Braeburn, we...

101
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:48,484
And here is the most wonderful sight in all of...

102
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:50,430
AAAPPLELOOSA!

103
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:52,557
Our apple orchard.

104
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:53,884
Braeburn!

105
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:55,530
First harvest should be any day now.

106
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:56,762
-Braebu...
-Good thing too.

107
00:07:56,763 --> 00:07:58,485
-Brae...
-Cause we need that grub to live on.

108
00:07:58,576 --> 00:07:59,671
BRAEBURN!!!

109
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,326
Uh... yes, cous?

110
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:06,443
You have a very nice town n' all
but we have a huuuge problem.

111
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,211
Some of our friends are missin'.

112
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:10,709
-A stampede of buffalo!
-The took Spike!

113
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,660
-Rainbow Dash went after them!
-And we can't find Pinkie Pie!

114
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:17,584
And we had an apple tree with us
for your orchard, but they took that too.

115
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,810
Did you say buffalo?

116
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:27,899
Dem buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take
every single tree you see here off this land.

117
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,219
They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in.

118
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,502
But why?

119
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,527
Beats me.

120
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:37,405
We put a lotta hard work into this land so we
could feed our town, our families, our foals.

121
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:39,919
And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go?

122
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,012
T'ain't fair.

123
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,923
Oh, I can't wait to get my hooves
on that little buffalo.

124
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:00,224
Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.

125
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:00,916
Boo!

126
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:03,642
Pinkie Pie!

127
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:06,997
Ah, you caught me! Looks like I tricked you
and didn't get away with it either.

128
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:08,192
You're good.

129
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:11,594
Shh! What do you think you're doing?
You gotta get outta here.

130
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:12,719
I do?

131
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:14,366
You're gonna blow my cover!

132
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,399
I am?

133
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,109
-I'm trying to save Spike!
-OH MY GOSH! So am I!

134
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,535
And the more of us there are out here,
the more chance is of us getting...

135
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,298
...caught.

136
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,092
Run, Pinkie. I'll hold them off. Save yourself!

137
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:31,295
STOP!!!

138
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,045
Dash, Pinkie, 'sup?

139
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:38,128
Hey, no worries, I know those guys.

140
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:38,957
They're cool.

141
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,490
If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro.

142
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:52,831
Seems they took me by mistake.

143
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:55,036
And they feel awful about it too, poor guys.

144
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:57,663
Fortunately, they totally respect dragons...

145
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,815
...so they treat me like an honored guest.

146
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:03,282
Still don't like ponies much though,
but you're with me, so it's cool.

147
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,643
Huh. Why, I still don't trust them.

148
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:07,750
I say we turn tail and bail while we still...

149
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:12,678
Before we finish eating?
Are you a loco in the coco?

150
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:18,109
Can I please have more of that
mushy stuff, whatever it was?

151
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,789
Certainly. And, Mr. Spike,
you like gemstones, yes?

152
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,462
Turquoise, mmm...

153
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,079
This here's Little Strongheart.

154
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,924
And these are my friends,
Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.

155
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:31,361
You!

156
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:32,361
You!

157
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,346
That's it! We are outta here.

158
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:38,286
Wait!

159
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:41,436
Please, accept my apologies
for what happened on the train.

160
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:43,510
We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.

161
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:44,964
Yeah, right.

162
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:47,478
We only wanted the tree.

163
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:51,840
The settler ponies have overtaken the land
and have planted an orchard all over it.

164
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:57,358
Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer
run over our traditional stampeding grounds.

165
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,271
Huh?

166
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:01,061
I think it's time they've met Chief Thunderhooves.

167
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:07,360
We have a long and winding stampeding trail...

168
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:10,268
...which we run upon for many generations.

169
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,563
My father stampeded upon these grounds...

170
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:17,039
...and his father before him...

171
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:19,918
...and his father before him...

172
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,116
...and his father before him...

173
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,939
...and his father before him...

174
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:29,268
-...and...
-I think they get the idea, Chief.

175
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:34,638
It is a sacred tradition to run the path every year.

176
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,272
But these year, these settler ponies, these...

177
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,031
Appleloosans!

178
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,500
They planted apple trees all over it
without asking our permission.

179
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:52,417
Well, that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?

180
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,056
The ponies refused to move their trees...

181
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:59,097
...so we are stuck here and it is not fair!

182
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,919
See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to...

183
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:08,107
I'll say they had a good reason!

184
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:12,509
Come on! We have some apple-picking
Appleloosans to talk to!

185
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:21,392
Gently, please.

186
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,614
Sorry, Rarity. But our friends are out there...

187
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:27,233
...and we have to be ready for a long hike
into buffalo territory if we're gonna save them.

188
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,580
Let's go!

189
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:34,012
Hi, guys!

190
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:34,916
Pinkie!

191
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:37,565
We're so glad you're safe.

192
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,226
How did you escape from the buffalo?

193
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,387
We didn't.

194
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:47,519
We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.

195
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:49,878
Oh yeah? 'bout what?

196
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:53,353
We brought our new pal Little Strongheart
here to explain to the Appleloosans...

197
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:56,245
...why they should move
the apple trees off buffalo land.

198
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:57,582
That information would be quite help...

199
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,201
That's weird. Cause my cousin Braeburn
here wants to explain to the buffalo...

200
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:03,340
...why they should let the apple trees stay.

201
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:05,270
That would a useful thing to...

202
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:06,457
The land is theirs!

203
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,453
You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake.

204
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,651
Now you just gotta move 'em, that's all.

205
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:13,104
Well, heh...

206
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:16,733
They busted their rumps here! And now
they're supposed to bust their rumps again...

207
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,397
...just cause some buffalo
won't stampede someplace else?

208
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,214
Plant the trees somewhere else.

209
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:22,275
Where?

210
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:24,728
It's the only flat land around these parts.

211
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,573
The buffalo had it FIRST!

212
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:29,286
The settler ponies need it to LIVE!

213
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:32,748
Look!

214
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:36,630
Both the settlers and the buffalo
have good reasons to use this land.

215
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,958
There must be something we can do.

216
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:40,876
Hey! I've got an idea!

217
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:03,415
<i>We may be divided
But of you all I beg</i>

218
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:09,523
<i>To remember we're all hoofed
At the end of each leg</i>

219
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:15,264
<i>No matter what the issue
Come from wherever you please</i>

220
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:18,849
<i>All this fighting gets you nothing
But hoof-and-mouth disease</i>

221
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,169
<i>Arguing's not the way
Hey, come out and play!</i>

222
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,604
<i>It's a shiny new day
So what do you say?</i>

223
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:29,157
<i>You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare</i>

224
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:30,895
<i>It's a right thing to do</i>

225
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:34,468
<i>You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare</i>

226
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:37,630
<i>And there'll always be a way through!</i>

227
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,486
<i>Both our diets, I should mention
Are completely vegetarian</i>

228
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:44,623
<i>We all eat hay and oats
Why be at each other's throat?</i>

229
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:48,259
<i>You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare</i>

230
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,652
<i>It's a right thing to do</i>

231
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:56,760
<i>And there'll always be a way throoough!</i>

232
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:05,255
Alright, Pinkie Pie, that was FANTASTIC!
What a great song, you're right on!

233
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:12,438
It appears that Sheriff Silverstar
and I have come to...

234
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:13,651
...an agreement.

235
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:14,696
We have.

236
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,799
That was the worst performance we've ever seen.

237
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:21,491
Absotively.

238
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,953
The time for action is upon us.

239
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:28,687
Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow.

240
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:31,811
And if the orchard is still there...

241
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,630
...we'll flatten it!

242
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,094
And the whole town!

243
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,389
But Chief...!

244
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,087
And we Appleloosans say you
better bring your best...

245
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:44,355
...cause we'll be ready and waitin'!

246
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:45,594
But Sheriff...!

247
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:53,938
Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all.

248
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:02,972
I want my kin to have what they need to live...

249
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:06,622
...but a storm's a-brewin' here.
And I don't like the look of it.

250
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:10,228
We've just got to talk some sense into them
before somepony gets hurt.

251
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,738
Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we...

252
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,028
About the trees, now if you just...

253
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,896
If we could just sit down and talk, we could...

254
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:45,418
Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!

255
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:58,043
Sheriff! If we could only...

256
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:30,414
Isn't there some way to stop this?

257
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,835
Unless the settlers remove those trees...

258
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:34,602
...I do not think so.

259
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,488
I know you don't wanna do this.

260
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:42,102
But they have taken our land.

261
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,272
What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?

262
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:49,898
I don't know. But it's never too late
to think of something.

263
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,483
At noon it will be too late.

264
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:12,592
Come on! Think!

265
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,148
Thinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthink!

266
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,082
He's not gonna do it!

267
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:49,417
<i>You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare</i>

268
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:51,292
<i>It's a right thing to do</i>

269
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:52,006
<i>You gotta shaaare...</i>

270
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,920
CHAAARGE!

271
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:07,438
Ready?

272
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:08,895
Aim...

273
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,512
FIRE!

274
00:20:31,157 --> 00:20:32,310
Yum!

275
00:20:32,718 --> 00:20:36,056
Hey! I've got a much better idea!

276
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:52,972
We will allow the apple orchard to stay
in exchange for a share of its fruit.

277
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,985
Those... delicious apple pies.

278
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,218
I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week.

279
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,895
Bloomberg, this is your special day.

280
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:09,692
Mama's so proud of you.

281
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:19,051
"Dear Princess Celestia."

282
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:21,719
"Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing."

283
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:24,542
"Even the worst of enemies can become friends."

284
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,228
"You need understanding and compromise."

285
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:30,081
"You've got to share. You've got to care."

286
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:32,344
Hey! That's what I said!

287
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:37,694
