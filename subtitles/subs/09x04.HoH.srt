00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:10,642
     sibling rivalry. I had
      an inside pony help.

00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,346
    It wasn't hard to miss
  there was some disagreement

425
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,415
 on the whole "security" thing.

426
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,151
     Luna: I said we could
       do it ourselves,

427
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,354
      but some ponies are
      a bit more stubborn...

   <i> Luna and I struck a deal.</i>

431
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,430
     <i> She put Zephyr in</i>
    <i> charge of the catacombs</i>

432
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,832
   <i> and helped keep Celestia</i>
  <i> out of the castle hallways.</i>

433

      Ahem.

00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:02,727
I er.. apologize for not listening
to your concerns, sister.

442
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,462
It seems we need
to make adjustments

00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:08,198
to account for threats <i>inside</i>
the castle as well as out.

446
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:17,475
     So... if Twilight and
    Shining Armor failed...

447
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:18,943
      who gets the crown?

         [sigh]

The TRUE Sibling Supreme. Spike.

450
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:25,783
              Huh?

451
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,086
