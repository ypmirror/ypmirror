1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,282
Thank you for the mail delivery!

2
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,483
     Have a wonderful day!

3
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,998
You're new here, right?

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,502
I'm Cozy Glow, Professor
Sparkle's Friendship Assistant.

5
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,070
Welcome to our school!

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,841
Your first class is
just down that hall.

7
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,084
A seven-letter
word for teamwork...

8
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,952
                  Have you tried
                  synergy?

9
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,488
        That's it!

10
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,790
        Thanks, Cozy!

11
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,958
     Heh. What are friends for?

12
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,033
         Good morning,
       Professor Sparkle!

13
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,470
The mail's here already?
What time is it!?

14
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,672
    I'm late for my class's
   field trip to Cloudsdale!

15
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:17,877
          Don't worry!

16
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,546
   I asked Professor Rainbow
    Dash to cover for you.

17
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,614
And she said.. yes?

18
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,917
       Uh huh! I told her
       how busy you are,

19
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,286
    and how much her
     loyalty meant to you.

20
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,089
I also color-coded your teaching
schedule by friendship element,

21
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,858
 and cataloged all the magical
  artifacts in the school.

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,326
      I hope that's OK...

23
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,096
   OK? Cozy,
that's amazing!

24
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,731
You're like my
right-hoof pony.

25
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,466
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

26
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:43,068
     [giggle]
    It's like you taught me.

27
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,737
    Helping is what
    friendship's all about.

28
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,872
                  Exactly!

29
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,574
          And hopefully my class
           is learning that

30
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,542
                 on their field
                 trip right now.

31
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,144
I heard they might do
some sight-seeing first.

32
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,783
             Tada!

33
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,119
  The Pegasus Weather Factory!

34
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,722
 Every drop of rain or flake of
  snow from Cloudsdale

35
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,424
       comes from there!

36
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,959
            All: Whoaaa.

37
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,028
I know, right?

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,330
     Hey! The cool
     stuff's over here!

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,335
    Wow! I've never stood on
      a cloud before.

40
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,771
You can't, normally.
But for our trip,

41
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,173
I cast a spell that lets
us walk like Pegasi.

42
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:24,643
           Hey Yona!

43
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,245
   Come check out this view.

44
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,915
  Unless you're too scared...

45
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,483
        Yona not scared.

46
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,220
       AHHH! NOW YONA SCARED!

47
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,904
  C'mon! We gotta catch them!

48
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,413
            Gotcha!

49
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,847
         It's OK, Yona!

50
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,616
   You like flying, remember?

51
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,384
      Flying. Not falling!

52
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,423
      I don't understand!

53
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,725
       I-I-It's like my spell
        stopped working!

54
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,461
 That's.. never happened before!

55
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,899
     We have an emergency!

56
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,201
      The students dropped
        out of the sky!

57
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,003
           Slow down.
         What happened?

58
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,339
    I cast a spell for our
   field trip to Cloudsdale.

59
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,107
   But my magic just.. failed!

60
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,577
We barely caught
everypony in time!

61
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,645
I'm glad you're all OK.

62
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,847
But I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about, Starlight.

63
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,516
Maybe you did your
 spell wrong.

64
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,384
Let's take a look.

65
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,189
    I didn't drop that book...

66
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,324
               Maybe you did
               your spell wrong..?

67
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,326
                  Rarity: OWWWW!

68
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,195
   Rarity ran into the door.

69
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:26,698
       My magic is GONE!

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,203
    I even had to use my
    hooves to coif my tail!

71
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,572
      Still think there's
    nothing to worry about?

72
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,274
This doesn't make any sense.

73
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,476
Magic can't just disappear!

74
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,344
Something has to
be causing this.

75
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:40,546
Um...

76
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:44,216
Didn't we learn in class about
a creature that eats magic?

77
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,452
        Tir...T..Tur..something?

78
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,488
             [gasp] Tirek!

79
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,124
 Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?

80
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,861
Spike!? What's wrong!?

81
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,533
         Whew. Thanks.

82
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,702
    I've never had a letter
    get stuck before..

83
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,305
  It's from Princess Celestia!

84
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,874
We've all been called to an
emergency meeting in Canterlot!

85
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,742
             Look!

86
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,746
Pretty sure I know
what it's about.

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,151
  Celestia: Throughout our city,
   ponies have been reporting

88
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,086
 tales of their magic failing.

89
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,889
    Spells going wrong,
     potions not working...

90
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,358
Even raising the moon
has become difficult.

91
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,460
Are there similar
troubles in Ponyville?

92
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,529
 We experienced it first hoof.

93
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,431
  It's the same in my kingdom.

94
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,600
      The Crystal Heart
      seems safe for now,

95
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,435
 but.. I worry if this continues.

96
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,609
  Letter for the Princesses,
  from Starswirl the Bearded.

97
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,616
     Ah! It is even more
    terrible than we feared.

98
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,752
     Magic is disappearing
     all across Equestria.

99
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,223
Starswirl believes the power
will drain from our land

100
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,758
in three days.

101
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,028
     First, unicorn magic
     and spells will fail.

102
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,730
  That's what's happening now!

103
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:08,667
On the second day, creatures
will lose their magic abilities.

104
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,369
           [gasp] Oh, no!

105
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:14,606
  And finally, magical
  artifacts will stop working.

106
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,009
       When the sun sets
       on the third day,

107
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,611
    the magic in our
     world will be gone...

108
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,579
            forever!

109
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,683
 But why is this happening now?

110
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,550
That's the worst part.

111
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:26,919
We have no idea.

112
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,954
 Has anypony checked on Tirek?

113
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,723
   You mean the big red scary
   centaur who eats magic?

114
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,926
      Why would we want...
       Ohhhh. Right.

115
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,598
    If he has found some way
     to escape his prison,

116
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,570
 or work from within it, he
 could be responsible for this.

117
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,905
             That is the best
             explanation so far.

118
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,707
                Somepony should
                investigate.

119
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,674
     We'll go.

120
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,109
        Oh, no no no no.

121
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,078
    Not without us you wo--

122
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,781
    Wait. Did you say "we"?

123
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,849
      I've finally learned
      that it's OK

124
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,685
       to count on your
       friends for help.

125
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,153
Um...You do want
to come, right?

126
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,722
                    Uh, DUH!

127
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,190
Thank you all.

128
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,359
We will search for ways
to protect Equestria

129
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,694
in your absence.

130
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,863
 Be careful. Tartarus has
 changed since you were there.

131
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,399
      It now holds many
      dangerous creatures,

132
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,735
     and you won't be able
     to rely on your magic.

133
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,738
    With her friends by her
    side, she won't have to.

134
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,743
  OK. I left you my lesson
  plan, all my student files,

135
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,645
and my annotated syllabus notes.

136
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,980
If anything goes
wrong, get Celestia.

137
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:29,749
                      Got it.

138
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,184
Maybe I should just
close the school

139
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,853
and send my students home?

140
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:37,056
       [sigh] Would you go save
       Equestria already?

141
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:42,294
OK! Cozy packed us all up for a
  trip to bad guy central.

142
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,062
Don't forget
the sandwiches!

143
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,964
I marked whose is
whose just in case.

144
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,733
        Starlight can't
        stand mustard.

145
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,335
                 That's so sweet
                 of you, Cozy.

146
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,405
  But Twilight has asked me to
  stay here to run the school.

147
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,008
Oh. I thought that after what
happened last time...

148
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,610
                Once you survive
                Discord,

149
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,445
                anything else is
                a piece of cake.

150
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,782
        Plus she'll have
        you to help her.

151
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,118
        Oh, golly, yes!

152
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,154
     I promise I'll be the
     best assistant ever!

153
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,156
      C'mon! We can start
       working on your

154
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,558
   substitute Headmare plans
   right now, if you like.

155
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,428
          Wow...! Uh, OK.

156
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,767
        See? Nothing to
        worry about.

157
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,935
      Tell me there's
    nothing to worry about.

158
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,279
         Good morning,
      friendship students!

159
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,949
   I know we're all sad
  Professor Sparkle is away...

160
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,486
    But don't worry, because
     she left ME in charge,

161
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,855
       to do things just
       the way she would!

162
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,326
Uh. I thought Starlight Glimmer was
 gonna be temporary headmare.

163
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,862
      She was. But she
       left me this note:

164
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,065
     "I have to go. Twilight
      needs my help."

165
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,934
 "I know the school is in
  good hooves with you, Cozy."

166
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,004
       Isn't that sweet?

167
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,506
     We won't let Starlight
     down, will we?

168
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,244
It's just kinda weird, isn't it?

169
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,247
                  I don't know
                  what you mean.

170
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,749
       Like... why'd she
       change her mind?

171
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,217
       Why did Starlight
         write a note,

172
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,619
     instead of say goodbye
      to us herself?

173
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,354
    Doesn't make any sense.

174
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:20,325
          Oh, Smolder.

175
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:23,194
     You forget; we're
     not scheming dragons.

176
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,496
         We're ponies!

177
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,497
    Sounds like somecreature
       needs to do

178
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,799
         a little extra
      friendship homework!

179
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,002
             Grrr.

180
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,837
Yak not pony either.

181
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,573
If Smolder get homework,
Yona get homework.

182
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,574
Me too.

183
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,342
                         I'm in.

184
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,944
     Yeah! Homework party!

185
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,914
  Ugh. Fine.

186
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,515
         What loyalty!

187
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,118
     Professor Rainbow Dash
     would be so proud.

188
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,053
   You are such good friends.

189
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,388
          You all are!

190
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,256
      And I'm grateful
       because it will be

191
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,193
     awfully hard running a
     whole school alone!

192
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,228
      Can I count on each
      of you to help me?

193
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,532
       Thank you so much!

194
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,634
     It's just like our
     professors taught us:

195
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,904
      together, we can get
       through anything!

196
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,879
                         [thunk]
                         Owww!

197
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,182
     Ugh! I have had it with
     these horrible flies!

198
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,419
       [whining] I miss my magic.

199
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,321
   Have you tried using your
    tail to shoo them away?

200
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,223
     Oh! Bite your tongue!

201
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,158
      It's for decorative
        purposes only.

202
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,094
     Hey, I didn't know we
     packed green cupcakes!

203
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,831
         Um. We didn't.

204
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,034
They must have gone bad without
magic to keep them cold.

205
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,204
    Magic this, magic that.

206
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,739
     We don't need magic to
     go on a little hike!

207
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,178
        You were saying?

208
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,748
  You just need to think more
   like Earth ponies, y'all.

209
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,417
      Granny's Apple Core
       No Bite No More.

210
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,784
  That'll keep the flies off.

211
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,589
      [sniff] Ooh, it smells
      just like it looks!

212
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,259
        Even if our
        food's spoiled,

213
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,428
     these blueberries are
      still good to eat.

214
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,731
  Too bad we can't do anything
   about the rainstorm.

215
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,401
  I can't stop that storm by
  myself but I can still help!

216
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,944
   I think we have all the
   magic we need right here.

217
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,746
     Not that I don't
      want to get it back...

218
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,714
           Let's go!

219
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,889
      Cozy Glow baked our
     class cupcakes today!

220
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,358
     And she made all of us
     friendship bracelets!

221
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,393
             She's the nicest
             pony I've ever met.

222
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,595
                 I'm SO glad
                 she's Headmare.

223
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,165
Uh, temporary
Headmare, right guys?

224
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,801
Oh, oh. Of course!

225
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:46,537
But if Twilight takes her time
coming back, I won't mind.

226
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,981
Finally! We thought you
forgot about study club!

227
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,016
Sorry I'm late.

228
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,052
Cozy Glow gave our class tickets
to a Sapphire Shores concert

229
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,387
in Ponyville tonight.

230
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,655
          You get the feeling
          Cozy's trying too hard

231
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:05,890
            to make us like her?

232
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,692
Or maybe she just
wants to help us

233
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:11,529
keep our minds off of how scary
it is that magic's disappearing.

234
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,164
       I don't trust her.

235
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,001
 What's she up to behind those
  big eyes and bouncy curls?

236
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:22,240
  And why Cozy Pony coming out
  catacombs so late at night?

237
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,447
Let's go ask her.

238
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,886
       This is the only
       door to Tartarus.

239
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,155
     The good news is, the
      seal isn't broken,

240
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,323
        so we know Tirek
         didn't escape.

241
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,458
         Let me guess.

242
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,260
      Ya got bad news too.

243
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,196
  Last time I was here, I had
   to use magic to get in.

244
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,665
  And according to Starswirl,
   all unicorn magic

245
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,768
was gone by yesterday's sunset.

246
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,502
      Maybe he was wrong!

247
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,775
          Don't worry, Twilight.

248
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:58,943
                     I got this!

249
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,213
      Free pizza delivery!

250
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,317
    Huh. Always worked before.

251
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,118
           Oh, well.

252
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,721
Did any of y'all pack something
that could actually help?

253
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,027
      These all do magic,

254
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,462
    but not the kind we're
    looking for, I'm afraid.

255
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,298
        How about this!

256
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,733
The Key of Unfettered Entrance!

257
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,435
Where did you find this, Spike?

258
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,303
    In your bag!

259
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,105
Cozy Glow must have
packed it for you.

260
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,707
       She really did
      think of everything!

261
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,643
Um, what does it do?

262
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,178
It can magically open any door.

263
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,314
And since artifacts like this
haven't lost their power yet...

264
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,129
  I guess it only works once.

265
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:00,738
             Aaah!

266
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,906
          Cockatrice!

267
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,641
   Do something, Fluttershy!

268
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:04,575
       Don't look at it!

269
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,310
    It'll turn you to stone!

270
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,147
    I don't feel like stone.

271
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,716
       Unless it's really
        bouncy stone.

272
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,056
                 I think he lost
                 his magic too.

273
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,125
       All the creatures
        here must have.

274
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,132
   Starswirl said that would
   happen on the second day.

275
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,468
I know it should
make me feel safer, but...

276
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,103
     it just makes me sad.

277
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,704
       We gotta fix this!

278
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,788
  Where is Princess Twilight?

279
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,523
       Oh, golly! She's
        away on a quest.

280
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,326
        I'm watching the
        school for her.

281
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,228
        Magic is failing
        across our land,

282
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,498
   and she left a <i>foal</i>
  in charge of this facility!?

283
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,566
            Yes sir!

284
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,501
       Is there anything
       I can do for you?

285
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,436
That won't be necessary.

286
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,939
  Twilight's folly stops here.

287
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,942
 As of now, <i>I</i> am Headstallion.

288
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,112
      And I have quite a
      few changes to make.

289
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,225
     If all these monsters
       lost their magic,

290
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:30,562
   then getting past Cerberus
     should be easy-peasy.

291
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,464
                     [footsteps]
                     Look out!

292
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,568
       I'll talk to him.

293
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,973
    Um, excuse me, puppy...

294
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,042
 You're a very good guard dog.

295
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,111
          Yes you are!

296
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:50,281
But um, we were wondering if we
could get by to check on Tirek?

297
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,953
     That looks like a yes.

298
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,490
                 I'll get you a
                 towel, darling.

299
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,069
  The Princess of Friendship,
   here for a visit.

300
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,672
   What have I done to earn
   the honor of your company?

301
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,240
    We want answers, Tirek.

302
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,442
     Magic is disappearing
      from Equestria.

303
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,178
            I know.

304
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,815
      What a waste of such
      [slurp] delicious power.

305
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,754
    So you are behind this!

306
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,189
   Silly filly.

307
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,224
If I had all that magic,

308
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,526
     do you think I'd still
     be locked up in here?

309
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,399
     But I might know
     something about it...

310
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,538
      What are you doing!?

311
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,841
      Those are Twilight's
       student files!

312
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,844
   These aren't. Not anymore.

313
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:56,347
  With Equestria under attack,
  ponies must stand together!

314
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,584
 Twilight has endangered us all
     by skipping off on

315
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,421
"friendship trips," while these
dangerous creatures run loose!

316
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,024
You don't think <i>they're</i> the
 reason magic is disappearing,

317
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,360
            do you?
            - Yes.

318
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,229
    I came to warn Twilight.

319
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:15,232
But since she is gone, it falls
 to me to protect you foals

320
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,835
      from those monsters.

321
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,669
        He's blaming us?

322
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,005
Did you hear something?

323
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,941
     It sounded like it
     came from over there.

324
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,981
   You again, as I suspected...

325
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,923
     From now on, this
      school is <i>pony only.</i>

326
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,759
      As nature intended.

327
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,665
  Since you refuse to explain
  your plot against Equestria

328
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,634
      and return the magic
         you stole,

329
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,069
   you will stay here while I
   summon your guardians

330
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,404
       to take you home.

331
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,406
Wait!

332
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,376
 You were right about them from
   the beginning, Chancellor.

333
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,710
                 I see that now.

334
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,179
            -What are you saying!?
          -Sandbar!?

335
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,147
     I don't want anything
     to do with creatures

336
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,982
 that could threaten Equestria!

337
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,518
               Wisely put, colt.

338
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:14,658
  Everypony will come to
   their senses, ...eventually.

339
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,210
       What in tarnation!?

340
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,278
Sorry. I ran
out of apples.

341
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,049
I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

342
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,450
   My friends are in trouble!

343
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,252
      Chancellor Neighsay
      locked them up!

344
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,388
             Huh? I thought Cozy
             Glow was in charge.

345
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,623
          Not anymore.

346
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,325
 But you guys are good buddies.

347
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,460
    If you can convince her
    to distract Neighsay,

348
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,995
  I can break out my friends.

349
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:51,963
       Will you help me?

350
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,465
                   Do mulberries
                    have seeds?

351
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,101
         That's a yes.

352
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,505
      Where's Equestria's
      magic going, Tirek?

353
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,308
  What's making it disappear?

354
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,246
If you let me out, I'm sure
it would jog my memory.

355
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:13,351
What do you say? I scratch
your back, you scratch mine?

356
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,820
       How 'bout you tell
       us what you know,

357
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,388
       or you'll be stuck
       here forever,

358
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,292
because we're out of magic keys
and nopony can open the door?

359
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,627
              Ohh, dear. I hadn't
              thought of that.

360
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,697
       We're just as
       trapped as Tirek?

361
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,499
        Ha ha ha ha ha.

362
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,867
          What a pity.

363
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,635
         Well, for you.

364
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,971
     Sweet revenge for me.

365
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,610
 It seems my little protégé's
 plan worked after all.

366
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,446
     Which little protégé?

367
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,782
Oh, we've never met.

368
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:45,883
We're pen pals.

369
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:50,655
Each letter had so many
questions about draining magic.

370
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,023
          And you answered them!?

371
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,525
Well, I was bored.

372
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,362
So I simply pointed my pen
pal in the right direction.

373
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,933
     Can't you just tell us
      your pen pal's name?

374
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,704
      I mean, since we're
      stuck here anyway...

375
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,539
          Oh, why not.

376
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,242
   The irony is too perfect.

377
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,245
         Her name is...

378
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,714
           Cozy Glow!

379
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,516
     I could've sworn I saw
     her come down this way

380
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,050
   when she left her office.

381
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,229
     Enjoying yourself
      in there, Starlight?

382
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:35,966
 I'm sorry I had to push you
 in, but what else could I do?

383
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:40,138
       You were going to
       ruin all my plans.

384
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,975
You might get some company soon,

385
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,912
   if I can't make that
  annoying Neighsay BACK OFF.

386
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,151
  All this magic needs time to
   drain from Equestria

387
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,087
     before my vortex sucks
      it to another realm!

388
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,192
    Three days can sure
    seem like forever, huh?

389
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,829
      You know, you ponies
       got it all wrong.

390
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,031
    Friendship isn't <i>magic.</i>

391
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,166
      Friendship is POWER!

392
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,437
     With Twilight and her
     lackies out of my way,

393
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,308
       all of Equestria
       will bow to me...

394
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,445
       The future EMPRESS
       OF FRIENDSHIP!
