144
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,097
          Oh, come on!

145
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,201
 Ugh. No Maud, no cake, no anything!

146
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,670
 And how annoying was that pony?

147
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,038
       Who takes that long
         to say goodbye?

148
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,540
   Or was it "see you later?"

149
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,675
 UGH, now he's got me doing it!

150
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,476
             [thud]

151
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,878
              Hello, Pinkie Pie.

152
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,113
      MAUD!

153
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:28,880
     Found you!

154
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,081
My turn to hide!

155
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,283
[crash]

156
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,552
       I'm sorry I wasn't
      around this morning.

157
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,221
      Oh, psh, what are you
     apologizing to me for?

158
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,623
 I'm not upset, you silly willy.

159
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,792
                The reason is I
                 met somepony--

160
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:41,994
Want to hang
out right now?

161
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,595
I mean, I can see you're
not doing anything

162
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,698
with anypony else.

163
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:49,100
Unless they're invisible
or really small.

164
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,020
             Pinkie.

165
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,539
  The reason I've been so busy
 is that I have a boyfriend now.

166
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,507
             A WHA?

167
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,875
          A boyfriend.

168
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,977
           A WHAAAAAA?

169
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,312
          A boyfriend.

170
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,781
           A WHAAAAAA?

171
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,283
          A boyfriend.

172
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,151
       That's so exciting!

173
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,252
           MY sister!

174
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,954
            IN LOVE!

175
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,023
       Technically, we're
         "in like."

176
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,958
       Tell me EVERYTHING!

177
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,576
             [zoom]

178
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,193
        Who is he? What's
       his favorite color?

179
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,246
     Does he like ice cream?

180
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:19,197
     If he were a bird, what
    kind of bird would he be?

181
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,367
Wait. Is he
actually a bird?

182
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,835
Oh! I don't know because you
haven't told me anything yet!

183
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,904
        You'll like him.

184
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,039
    We have a lot in common.

185
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,874
Well, I love you,

186
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,910
so I know I'm going to
love your boyfriend!

187
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,613
Oh! I can't wait
to meet him!

188
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,414
              You don't have to.

189
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:38,917
             [gasp]

190
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,419
He's a rock!

191
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,222
And you love rocks,
so it's perfect!

192
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,690
[gasp] Is Boulder jealous?

193
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,026
      No, behind the rock.

194
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,529
  Mudbriar, are you back there?

195
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,599
                  Technically?
                  Not anymore.

196
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,934
       [gasp] WHA WHA WHAAAAA?

197
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,776
                Pinkie Pie,
              meet Mudbriar.

198
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,677
                Technically?

199
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,079
              We've already met.

200
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,047
You...?

201
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:09,981
              Yes.

202
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,616
              You?

203
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:12,517
              Yes.

204
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,885
              You.

205
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:14,920
              Yes.

206
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,988
            I mean... haha, you!

207
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,359
         You! You! You!

208
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,162
         Yes. Yes. Yes.

209
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,931
I'm sorry, let's
start over.

210
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,767
Hi! I'm Maud's
sister, Pinkie Pie.

211
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,470
                 I know.

212
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,039
   So...

213
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,340
How did...

214
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,476
You two meet?

215
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,611
         At a rock show.

216
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,646
Oh, you're into
rocks too?

217
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,349
              No. I like sticks.

218
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,152
Then why were you
at a rock show?

219
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,855
   It was a petrified wood show,
    which technically

220
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,624
          makes it a stick show.

221
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,093
       Except that in the
    permineralization process

222
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,563
  of petrification, all organic
  material is replaced with

223
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,500
     silicates, i.e. rocks--

224
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:05,236
 --while retaining the original
  structural elements of wood.

225
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,840
   Q.E.D. It was a stick show.

226
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,409
          I'm... really
        into sticks too!

227
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,945
        They're great for
        hitting piñatas!

228
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,313
             Aaahhh!

229
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,649
     Pinkie!

230
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,018
Oh, you
wanna go first?

231
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,220
            That is stick abuse.

232
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,254
     It is?

233
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,925
  I'm sorry.

234
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,460
Oh, this is awful, I am not
being a very good sister.

235
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,412
Let's start over.

236
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,863
I'm Pinkie Pie,
nice to meet you.

237
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,332
          Technically?

238
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,967
       We've already met.

239
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,903
      You should introduce
       Pinkie to your pet.

240
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:40,772
     Oh!

241
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,440
Your pet likes fetch!

242
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,375
                This<i> is</i> my pet.

243
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,244
             So no.

244
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,449
Aw. Look at Twiggy and
Boulder playing together.

245
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,152
               They're adorable.

246
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,287
It's just a stick.

247
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,789
         Don't be rude.

248
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,325
      Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

249
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,760
        One more time...

250
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,896
I'm Pinkie Pie,
nice to meet you.

251
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,464
          Technically?

252
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,033
       We've already met.

253
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,434
             [growl]

254
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:15,617
          [straining]

255
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:16,575
             AHHHH!

256
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,909
      I don't get this guy!

257
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,079
   Wow! Maud has a boyfriend?

258
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,647
              Agh!

259
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,482
        How can she like
        someone so weird?

260
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,221
       He has an inanimate
        object for a pet!

261
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:30,873
          So does Maud.

262
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:32,924
      Boulder has TEN times
         the personality

263
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,093
      of some random stick.

264
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,195
 Mudbriar too, for that matter.

265
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,364
   He's not like Maud AT ALL.

266
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,335
  Maud is hilarious, friendly,
  caring, and easy to talk to!

267
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,437
        Yup, that's Maud.

268
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,874
But this guy is awkward,
quiet, and kind of...

269
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,609
   strange!

270
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,478
                 Uh, that also
               sounds like Maud.

271
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,047
         Hah! You're so
        funny, Starlight!

272
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,767
         Maud is nothing
         like Mudbriar.

273
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,986
  If she were, then we wouldn't
 be best sister friends forever.

274
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,189
   Well, Maud obviously
   likes something about him.

275
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,291
     [growl]

276
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,727
        Maybe you just need to
       spend more time with him,

277
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,161
               find out what you
                have in common.

278
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,462
That's easy.

279
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,263
    Nothing!

280
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,567
                   You both care
                    about Maud.

281
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,303
           I know! He could help
            you with her party!

282
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,238
   I guess...

283
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,874
     And I'll keep Maud busy
     while you and Mudbriar

284
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,177
     plan the best surprise
      birthday ever!

285
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,646
         That, I can do.

286
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,183
         Listen. Maud's
      birthday is tomorrow

287
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,885

  and I WANT to love Mudbriar,

  You mean that lumpy gray one?

No, the beautiful blue and
white one, right there.

439
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,397
  I would not describe that as
   beautiful, blue, or white,

    with beautiful gems.
