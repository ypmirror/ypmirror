1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,350
I wish the mailpony
would just come already!

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,250
I can't wait another minute to find out
if Rainbow Dash got in or not!

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,650
Pinkie Pie, you're more nervous
than Rainbow Dash!

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,600
I'm not nervous at all!

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,650
When I get into
the Wonderbolt Academy--

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,050
If you get in!
If you get in!

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,300
Don't jinx it!

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,660
I'm telling you,
it's in the bag!

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,530
Don't jinx it!

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,870
She is the best flyer in Ponyville.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,500
In Ponyville?

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,410
I'm probably the best flyer
in all of Equestria.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,439
I wouldn't be surprised

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,340
if they just went ahead,
and made me a Wonderbolt

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,290
on the first day.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,660
Got a letter here
for Rainbow Dash.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,790
I... didn't get in.

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,860
Gotcha!

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,490
You guys are so gullible.
Like I wasn't gonna get in!

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,500
I'm just sooooooooo
happy for you!

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,140
Uh... thanks?

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,310
Pinkie Pie?
I kinda need to get going.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,450
Okay. I'm done!

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,980
Sooner I get there,
sooner I get to show off my stuff!

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,360
See you guys in a week!

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,420
Good luck!

27
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,690
Won't need it!

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,280
DON'T FORGET TO WRITE!

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,600
Do you think she heard me?

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,940
Season 3 | Episode 7

33
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,560
Oh yeah!
This is gonna be sweet!

34
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,520
Well lookie what we got here.

35
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,760
Bet y'all think you're
Wonderbolt material, don't ya?

36
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,950
Yes ma'am!

37
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,800
Think you got what it takes
to be an elite flyer?

38
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,800
Yes ma'am!

39
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,460
Well then.
Let me be the first to tell you.

40
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,350
YOU DON'T!

41
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,570
If you had what it took
to be an elite flyer,

42
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,730
you'd already be
a Wonderbolt!

43
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,520
Still think
you're something special?

44
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,210
No ma'am!

45
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,970
Ya think you're hot stuff?

46
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,700
You look like you're the worst flyer
in the whole academy!

47
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,050
You'll probably quit
after the first day!

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
No ma'am!
I'd never quit, ma'am!

49
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,860
What about you?

50
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,030
Bet you couldn't fly past the
first flypole without getting winded.

51
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,680
Try me, ma'am.

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,880
What's that?

53
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,070
Let me show you
what I've got, ma'am.

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,100
You want a chance
to prove yourself, huh?

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,360
Yes ma'am!

56
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,480
Well then,
now's your chance.

57
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,980
Give me five hundred laps!

58
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,270
All of you!

59
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,570
Now!

60
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,030
Lap four-hundred and ninety-nine!

61
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,360
One more lap to go!

62
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,300
You're on!

63
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,240
Five hundred!

64
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,350
Not bad!
For a couple of newbies...

65
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,930
- Name's Lightning Dust.
- Rainbow Dash!

66
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,590
Wanna grab some grub
in the mess hall?

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,840
Definitely.

68
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,040
Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't
been gone twenty-four hours yet.

69
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,040
Give her a chance
to settle in first.

70
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,620
Why don't we just go see
what Twilight's up to?

71
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,590
I hear Princess Celestia's got her
working on some new spells!

72
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,390
New spells, huh?
Okay!

73
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,210
Wait!

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
If I'm not here when
Rainbow Dash's letter arrives,

75
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,080
I won't be able
to read it right away.

76
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,470
And if I don't read it right away,

77
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,890
I won't be able to write
her back right away.

78
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,460
And if I don't write
her back right away,

79
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,790
she might think
I didn't get her letter

80
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,190
and then she might worry
it got lost

81
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,970
and if she's worried about her letter
she'll be distracted,

82
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,920
and if she's distracted then
she won't do well at the academy,

83
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,040
and if she doesn't do well at the academy,
then she'll get kicked out

84
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,460
and if she gets kicked out, she'll never
be allowed to be a Wonderbolt,

85
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,640
and if she doesn't get
to be a Wonderbolt,

86
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,850
all her dreams
will be crushed!

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,840
And it will be
all... my... FAULT!

88
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,990
So in other words,
you're stickin' by the mailbox.

89
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,810
Yep!

90
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,090
Suit yourself.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,140
The Wonderbolts are the fastest,
best precision flyers in the world.

92
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,430
But spinouts can still happen.

93
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,630
And when they do,

94
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,140
a Wonderbolt must
be able to recover quickly.

95
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,310
This... is the Dizzitron.

96
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,960
It's gonna make you very,
I repeat, very dizzy.

97
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,120
Your task is to try and recover,
and fly straight again.

98
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,850
As soon as possible.

99
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,550
Once you have recovered,
you must come in for a smooth landing.

100
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,170
Now, who's first?

101
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,860
You.

102
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,550
- You're up.
- Me?

103
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,140
NOW!

104
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,340
- Ready?
- Yes ma'am!

105
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,400
Go!

106
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,820
Release!

107
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,470
Fifteen seconds.
Decent.

108
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,060
But I wouldn't go
writin' home about it!

109
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,770
Who's next?

110
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,020
All right, Rainbow Dash.
Let's see what you got.

111
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,400
Yes ma'am!

112
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,240
Okay, go!

113
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,450
Release!

114
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,960
Six seconds?!
That's an academy record.

115
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,300
You made it look so easy.

116
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,010
I make everything look easy.

117
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,400
Okay, Lightning Dust,
you're up.

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,940
Ma'am, can you put
the Dizzitron at maximum speed?

119
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,950
I wanna push my limits.

120
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,200
You sure about that?

121
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,610
Yes ma'am!

122
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,310
Okay. You asked for it.

123
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,920
Release!

124
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,100
Six point five seconds.
Not bad.

125
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,860
Next!

126
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,260
Nopony even came close
to six seconds!

127
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,120
They should make us
Wonderbolts right now!

128
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,920
Yeah, they should!

129
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,850
Listen up!

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,100
For the rest of the camp,
you'll be working in pairs.

131
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,690
Tomorrow morning,
I'll post the teams

132
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,790
including who'll be lead pony,
and who'll be wing pony.

133
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,370
Good luck.

134
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,070
- Like we're gonna need it!
- Heh, yeah!

135
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,920
So, which one of you lucky gals
gets to be my wing pony?

136
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,400
What?

137
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,440
You might wanna check the wall.

138
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,950
A wing pony?

139
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,180
They made us a team!
Isn't that awesome?

140
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,650
Permission to enter, ma'am.

141
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,120
What is it Rainbow Dash?

142
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,320
I had the best time on the Dizzitron!
Only six seconds!

143
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,660
And?

144
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,890
And you made me a wing pony!

145
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,170
Because I believe you and Lightning Dust
will be an unstoppable team.

146
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,380
Do you not think
you'll be an unstoppable team?

147
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,640
Yes ma'am!
I mean, no ma'am!

148
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,410
I mean... We'll be
an unstoppable team, ma'am.

149
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,720
Then what's the problem?

150
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,680
I think I should be lead pony,
ma'am.

151
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,450
And I think Lightning Dust likes to push
herself a little harder than you do.

152
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,390
That's why I made her lead pony.

153
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,700
- Got it?
- Yes ma'am.

154
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,000
Good.

155
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,240
Today you will all be participating
in the flag hunt.

156
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,000
We'll divide you into two teams.

157
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,950
Red, and blue.

158
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,850
Whoever finds the most flags
of the opposing team's color wins.

159
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,470
Oh, this is gonna be
so much fun!

160
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,510
If you think this is going to be fun,
you are sadly mistaken.

161
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,400
This is for training purposes.

162
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,930
This is not recess.

163
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,830
Lead ponies and wing ponies
must fly together.

164
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,420
If any pair splits apart,
they will be immediately disqualified.

165
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,380
Do you understand?

166
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,640
Yes ma'am!

167
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,406
Then let's go!

168
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,250
- Ready to rock and roll?
- Ready.

169
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,130
- You spotted any flags yet?
- Not yet.

170
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,900
Oh! There's one!

171
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,970
Good eye!

172
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,400
We should slow down.

173
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,270
It doesn't look like both of us
can make it at this speed!

174
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,490
Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash
found the first flag!

175
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,020
Come on!
Let's find some more!

176
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,100
Uh, sure.
Just give me a second.

177
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,630
Oh, you're fine.

178
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,500
Yeah... totally.

179
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,490
She's still at it.

180
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,850
I just wish we could help her!

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,610
Help me?

182
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,900
The only thing that could possibly help me
is a letter from Rainbow Dash!

183
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,520
It's been three days already.

184
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,670
Right now, she probably doesn't
even know our names anymore!

185
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,290
She probably can't
remember our faces!

186
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,630
"Pinkie Pie?
I never heard of a Pinkie Pie!"

187
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,450
"Who is Pinkie Pie?"

188
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,630
If you're so worried, then
why don't you send her a letter first?

189
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,850
'Course!
That's a great idea!

190
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,410
Oh wait!
I got an even better idea!

191
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,200
How about we send Rainbow Dash
a care package?

192
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,200
You know,
before she forgets all about us?

193
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,250
Although, come on,
let's face it.

194
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,910
It's probably too late for that.

195
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,020
But, maybe it'll jog
her memory somehow!

196
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,460
Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still
remembers our faces and who we are.

197
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,520
But I think sending her
a care package is a great idea!

198
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,780
A care package it is!
We'll send it through the mail!

199
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,450
WAIT! Ah!
That won't work at all!

200
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,550
Why not?

201
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,110
Because what if the package
gets lost in the mail?

202
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,030
What if somepony else
gets the package by accident

203
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,060
and then she remembers us
instead of Rainbow Dash

204
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,400
and then she becomes
our new friend,

205
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,400
and then the real Rainbow Dash
wouldn't ever know that

206
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,910
she used to have friends
and she forgot them!

207
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,960
Is anypony else following this?

208
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,700
I've got it!

209
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,540
We'll deliver the care package
to Rainbow Dash in person!

210
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,750
- I wouldn't mind a little trip.
- I'll go!

211
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,710
- Count me in!
- Me too!

212
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,660
Me five!

213
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,820
But don't be upset if
she doesn't recognize you at first.

214
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,390
It may take a while for her
to get her memory back.

215
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,810
Today we'll be doing
our famous air obstacle course.

216
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,750
The object of this exercise
is to work on your precision flying

217
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,770
under extreme circumstances.

218
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,480
And don't worry about winning.
It's not a race.

219
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,830
Now everypony,
get on your marks!

220
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,490
Ugh, can't they go any faster?

221
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,600
It's no good,
I can't get around them!

222
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,650
It doesn't matter!

223
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,910
We can still fly completely in sync
and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!

224
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,370
I guess...

225
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,340
What are they,
a couple of snails?

226
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,680
It's just a little weather.

227
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,950
Now's our chance
to pass these slowpokes!

228
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,000
Not bad!
And in record time, too!

229
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,570
Definitely made the right decision
making you two a team.

230
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,910
The others seem
to have had a little trouble

231
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,750
with the precision part
of the exercise.

232
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,250
I'd better go help
sort them out.

233
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,560
Why don't you two
go hit the mess hall early?

234
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,670
Yes ma'am!

235
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,430
Thank you ma'am!

236
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,260
Um, Lightning Dust?

237
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,720
Next time, maybe we don't
cut the other teams off like that?

238
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,730
Hey, you snooze, you lose!

239
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,860
Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed
to be able to recover from a spinout.

240
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,430
You saw them on the Dizzitron!
They could use the practice.

241
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,090
I mean, it's not our fault we're
so much better than those other guys!

242
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,830
Not every pony is destined
to become a Wonderbolt.

243
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,170
Only the best of the best, right?

244
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,890
Yeah, I guess you're right...

245
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,150
'Course I'm right!
Now let's go fuel up.

246
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,650
Kicking all that tail
has made me hungry.

247
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,620
Yeah!

248
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,900
I have an idea about how we can
literally blow away our competition.

249
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,090
But we're already way ahead.

250
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,770
Are you in, or not?

251
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,000
<i>Lightning Dust likes to push herself
a little harder than you do.</i>

252
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,150
<i>That's why I made her lead pony.</i>

253
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,080
I'm in!

254
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,680
Follow my lead!

255
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,460
I can't control it!

256
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a twister!

257
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,740
Hold on!

258
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,920
Noooooo!!

259
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,120
Are you guys okay?

260
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,550
Pinkie Pie!

261
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,250
You... remember me!

262
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,720
Well... yeah,
of course I remember you.

263
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,740
But what are you all doing here?

264
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,970
We wanted to bring you
a care package.

265
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,410
Didn't realize you'd be in the middle
of some crazy tornado drill.

266
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,140
That... was... awesome!

267
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,330
Awesome?

268
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,710
My friends could have been
smashed to pieces!

269
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,980
Yeah, but they weren't, right?

270
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,880
Can't say the same for the clouds.

271
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,420
We totally wiped them out
with that tornado.

272
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,550
The other cadets will have
to be up there for days

273
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,990
to bust as many as we did.

274
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,400
A hoof bump?
Seriously?

275
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,030
You made me clip my wing,

276
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,260
you sent half of our class into serious
tail spins on the obstacle course,

277
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,030
you unleashed a tornado
that nearly demolished my friends!

278
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,670
Yeah? And?

279
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,250
And I get that
you wanna be the best.

280
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,210
So do I!

281
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,840
But you're going about it
in the wrong way.

282
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,570
The Wonderbolts
don't seem to think so.

283
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,790
After all, Spitfire did make me
the leader and you the wing pony.

284
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,450
You're right. She did.

285
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,630
This better be important.

286
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,550
You're supposed to be up there
busting clouds with your partner.

287
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,860
We're done with that, ma'am.

288
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,230
Already?
That's an academy record!

289
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,810
Explain your methods.

290
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,340
That's why I'm here ma'am.

291
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,630
Lightning Dust decided to use
a tornado.

292
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,630
A bit excessive for cloud-busting.

293
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,980
But judging from your time,
it was obviously an effective tactic.

294
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,710
Yeah, well that "effective tactic"
nearly took out my friends!

295
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,370
No disrespect ma'am,

296
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,710
but there's a big difference between
pushing yourself as hard as you can,

297
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,480
and just being reckless.

298
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,430
And if being reckless is what
gets rewarded around here,

299
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,700
if that's what it means
to be a Wonderbolt,

300
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,890
then I don't want any part of it.

301
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,590
What are you saying, newbie?

302
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,900
I quit.

303
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,590
You did what?

304
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,450
Being a Wonderbolt
was your dream!

305
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,320
Not anymore.

306
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,160
Sorry, Rainbow Dash.
I know how much this meant to you.

307
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,690
Rainbow Dash!

308
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,030
How dare you storm out of my office
without giving me a chance to respond!

309
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,510
The Wonderbolts are looking for
the best flyers in Equestria.

310
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,460
You were right,

311
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,370
being the best should never come
at the expense of our fellow ponies.

312
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,050
It's not just about
pushing ourselves.

313
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,860
It's about pushing ourselves
in the right direction.

314
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,640
You've shown that
you're capable of doing just that.

315
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,400
You're no wing pony,
Rainbow Dash...

316
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,950
you're a leader.

317
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
