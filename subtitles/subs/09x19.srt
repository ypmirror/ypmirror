I realize this
is last minute,

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,820
but I've decided on a
quick trip to the Gem Cave!

some facetted iridescence

00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,682
 Spike has never turned down an
 opportunity to join me here.

45

    It's his favorite place!

go to the post office at all!?

    you're going to fill in,

And how's <i>that</i>?

56
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,889

 knows how to keep things <i>quiet</i>

57

59
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,631

             touches the ground!

60

  Oh. Well, Spike isn't here. I

71
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,111
     Spike declined my
   invitation to the Gem Cave

72
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,280
         and I intend to

78

00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,706
      that unintentionally
      hurt his feelings?

     I wonder if that's it...

00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,285
   Yeah! There was this whole
   thing where I pretended

139
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,254
   to get a cutie mark because
 Griffons don't get cutie marks

140
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:37,289
 so Princess Twilight had Spike
 send a bunch of letters off

141
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,091
      to Griffonstone about
     the first Griffon ever

142
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,794
   to get a cutie mark, which
    I really didn't have.

143
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,463
   Gabby wrote back explaining
    things, and after that,

144
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,298
     we just started
     writing back and forth.

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
Turns out we have
a lot in common!

146
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,301
   We both come from cultures

147
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,038
   that don't have the
   friendliest of reputations...

148
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,941
       AND we're both in the
       message-sending business!

152
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,622
  Now I understand why you
  didn't come to the Gem Cave.

153
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,392
      Having a friend in
      town is a rare treat.

154
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,893
       Look, since you're
        busy today,

155
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,496
    maybe we can do something
   tomorrow. Fabric shopping?

is doing.

       You two fly along..

                 We were just...

274
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:11,102
Your scroll said you were too
tired to do anything today,

275
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,573
but I guess you were just too
tired to do anything with me..

276
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,508
                No, no, no, no!
                That's not true!

277
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,577
          I can come with you on
          your rounds right now!

278
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,111
   I don't think
   so, Spike.

279
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,081
Maybe I'll just handle the
rounds on my own from now on.

280
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:28,653
         Ooh! Princess Shmarity
         uses her Prismatic Beam

281
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,288
             to change that poor
             monster's color

282
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,724
              to a more pleasing
              shade of purple!

    What do you think,
    Spike? Solids or prints?

285
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:48,940
 [sigh] Prints, I guess. You already
  have a lot of solid colors.

286
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,577
      Oh, you are so
      right. Prints it is.

287
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,112
        So nice to have
        you back, Spike.

288
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,918
   Although I hope you're able
    to reconcile with Gabby.

289
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,790
       I'm pretty sure she
        doesn't want to.

I quite enjoyed our
day together, Spike.

292
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,457
              Yeah.

293
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,160
                    Hi, Spike!
          Uh-huh.

294
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:44,963
          Hmm. I've never seen
          Spike this sad before.

295
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,331
                  Do you know
                  what happened?

296
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,334
Ahem.. Yes, well, perhaps
he's still just tired

297
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,802
     from Power Ponypalooza.

298
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,838
                   I don't think
                   that's it...

299
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,241
Wh... I suppose
it's <i>possible</i>

300
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,276
it could have something
to do with...

301
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,912
[cough] Gabby not wanting to spend
time with him anymore.

302
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,783
 What? I thought the two of them
 were hanging out all the time!

303
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:07,852
They were! Honestly, it
took everything I had

304
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,522
to convince him to spend
any time with <i>me</i> at all.

305
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,924
But between crystal
gem crevasses,

306
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,560
Power Pony conventions and
a marathon game of O&O,

307
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,429
I managed to get
some time in.

308
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,098
It sounds like you made
sure he didn't have any time

309
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,532
   to spend with Gabby at all..

310
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,235
       What? Pfft! I
       certainly did not!

311
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:30,208
Well, I suppose I may have
monopolized him a teeny bit!

312
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,246
I've just grown so used to
having Spikey-wikey around,

313
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,549
I wasn't prepared for how much
I'd miss him when he wasn't.

314
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,918
             Friendships change,

315
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,686
          but just because Spike
          made a new friend

316
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,855
              doesn't mean he
              stops being yours.

317
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,558
I know, but now I
have to share him!

318
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,596
Which I suppose I'll
have to get used to...

319
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,532
[gasp] Right after I fix
this mess I've made!

320
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,836
      Good talk.

321
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,414
Rarity!? Is all this
stuff for Spike again?

322
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,516
Wouldn't it be easier
to just give it to him?

323
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,418
And why are you even here?

324
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,355
    I am here to apologize.
   Actually, more to confess.

325
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,390
      And all of this stuff
        isn't for Spike.

326
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,593
        It's the evidence
         against ME!

327
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,628
Evidence? For what?

328
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,097
       For my acts of
       utter selfishness!

329
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,665
       I don't understand...

330
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,468
            These are the items
            I used to lure Spike

331
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,504
       into spending as much
       time with me as possible!

332
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,340
They are? You did?

333
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,207
         Spike: Rarity?

334
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:37,842
             What are you doing?

335
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,911
Well, obviously I'm
apologizing to Gabby

336
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,880
so the two of you can renew
your friendship, Spike...

337
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:43,882
      Now please, even if
      you can't forgive me

338
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,618
         you simply must
        forgive... SPIKE!?!

339
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,288
       Oh, I actually owe
       <i>you</i> an apology too...

340
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,691
      You apologize a lot..

341
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,994
   Oooh. I wish I didn't need to,

342
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:58,096
      but the more time you
       two spent together,

343
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,498
       the more I missed
       my time with Spike

344
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,935
 and the more I used every means
 at my disposal to get it back.

345
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,704
        I am truly sorry.

346
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,842
          You really missed
          spending time with me?

347
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,144
         Oh! Of course!

348
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,080
I have to say, after not
hanging out with you,

349
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,950
I understand why.
You're kinda awesome!

350
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,153
And.. I know what it's like
to miss that now too.

351
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,590
 So, do you think maybe we
 could start hanging out again?

352
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,025
Absolutely!

353
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,726
           I don't suppose you'd
           like some company

354
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,228
                  on your rounds
                  right now?

355
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,596
I sure would!

356
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,532
     Wonderful! I can't tell
      you how pleased I am

357
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,800
          that the two
         of you have...

358
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,736
             Heh.

359
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,171
          ..reconciled.

360
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:45,343
  I suppose Twilight is right.
  Friendships do change.

361
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,449
     Of course, Spike and I
     will always be friends

362
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,818
       and I <i>can</i> get used
       to sharing him.

363
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,789
            Oo ah ooh ooh!

364
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,391
    Sorry! I just didn't
    want to drop another one

365
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,893
       and wake the bats!

366
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:07,598
Darling. Catching the gems
is what the basket is for.

367
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,334
    Spike: Wow. You two need
    to be a lot quieter.

368
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,640
Spike! How wonderful
to see you!

369
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,409
               Yeah. Gabby and I
               had a great day,

370
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,711
      but I'll always still
      want my Rarity time.

371
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:28,519
   Ohhh! So that's how it works...
