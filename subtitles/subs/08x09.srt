1
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,039
              Huh?

2
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:11,577
               Oh!

3
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,450
    Did I miss the Teacher of
     the Month announcement?

4
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,919
      You're just in time.

5
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,387
      But it's gonna be me.

6
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,457
       Yeah, right! I got
        this one nailed.

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,459
    And the Friendship School
   teacher of the month is...

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,561
           Fluttershy!

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,697
     Ugh. Again..?

10
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,032
                  Come on!

11
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:37,002
      Oh, my. I don't know
       how I keep winning.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,007
        Yeah, me neither.

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,543
      The award is based on
       the students' vote.

14
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,345
   They must really like you!

15
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,751
Congratulations,
   Fluttershy.

16
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,226
     Next item of business.

17
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,861
       I've been looking
       into a new activity

18
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,429
   for our friendship classes.

19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,597
             Spike?

20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,772
        Section 147,
       paragraph 2 states

21
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,175
     that teamwork is a key
       part of friendship.

22
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:19,078
  And section 229, paragraph 9
    says outdoor activity

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,646
      reinforces learning.

24
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,382
       Add that together
      and what do you get?

25
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,601
            Ooh ooh!

26
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:28,619
       OK, lemme see 147,
       229 carry the two.

27
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,989
 Three hundred and eighty-seven?

28
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,791
  Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip!

29
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,460
     Leading it is a Teacher
     of the Month type-job,

30
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,628
      so I thought I'd ask-

31
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,263
     I'm yer pony, Twilight.

32
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,332
    Sweet Apple Acres has
    taught me a thing or two

33
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,702
     about workin' together.

34
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:45,971
 Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's
  the definition of teamwork.

35
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:50,242
  Heh heh heh, I'm sure you're
   not sayin' fancy flyin'

36
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,811
        makes ya a better
         choice than me.

37
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,648
      Heh heh heh heh, I
      wouldn't say<i> better,</i>

38
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,751
          just a little
         more<i> qualified.</i>

39
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:00,686
           No offense.

40
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,889
     Maybe you can lead the
      field trip together!

41
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,158
Bu-
Gah!

42
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,194
           Of course!

43
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:10,129
 Who better to model the
importance of working as a team?

44
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,365
      Um, Rarity,
     Fluttershy, me, Spike.

45
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,867
        This flower pot.

46
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,202
BOTH of you are
teamwork experts.

47
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,504
   If the students see the two
    of you teaching together,

48
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,806
    they'll learn even more.

49
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,108
     I know you've been
    competitive in the past,

50
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,577
    but I'm SURE you'd never
   let that get in the way of

51
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,879
      friendship education!

52
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,347
'A course.

53
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,481
                     Totally.

54
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,596
       I've never been on
      a field trip before.

55
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,867
     Yeah, what's the point
      of this, exactly?

56
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,136
Getting out of the
classroom, duh.

57
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,337
         Yak best at
         field tripping!

58
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,808
    That's what we're doing!?

59
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,377
             SO FUN!

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,080
                   Heh heh.

61
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,481
  Pretty sure the Headmare has
    something else in mind.

62
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,868
               All right, class.

63
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,353
  Today you'll learn how
  important working together is

64
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,655
      for building a strong
        friendship.

65
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:44,974
                      Hey y'all!

66
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,692
     Ready to get out there
      and do some learnin'

67
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,511
      the Apple family way?

68
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:50,729
     This is basically gonna
     be the best field trip

69
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,831
     in the history of ever.

70
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,599
   With me in charge, that is.

71
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,501
            Heh heh.

72
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,470
       With <i>us</i>  in charge.

73
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,172
Meanin' mostly me.

74
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,775
                 Yeah. Good one.

75
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,577
  And what teamwork activity do
 you two have planned for today?

76
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,013
Shed-building.
                 Canoe-racing.

77
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,083
No way. We get
  to do BOTH?

78
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:14,986
    I bet that's exactly what
   your teachers had in mind.

79
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,724
Why don't you start with
shed-building first?

80
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,460
    Heh. Don't mind if I do!

81
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,762
         Everycreature,
       follow the leader!

82
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,333
I'll check in later
to see how it's going.

83
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,802
Remember to work together!

84
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,376
  Now take a good deep breath.

85
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,478
        What do ya smell?

86
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,281
    [sniff] Ugh. Yak?

87
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,084
             Mm-hm!

88
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,018
        Nope. Try again.

89
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,654
          Um...apples?

90
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,358
   AND... Anyone? Anyone? No?

91
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,696
    The promise of... teamwork!

92
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,732
   That there's an apple shed.

93
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,001
   And this here is what we're
   gonna use to build it!

94
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,570
 Nothin' brings friends together
  like a little hard work

95
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,872
        and honest sweat.

96
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,143
        Sweat? Seriously?

97
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,179
      That's supposed to be
       part of friendship?

98
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,682
    Not everypony would
    know that, Rainbow Dash.

99
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,519
       Just Teacher of the
       Month kinda ponies.

100
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,587
Whatever. Let's
just get this done

101
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,823
so we can move on
to my activity!

102
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,870
     That's it! Measure
      twice, and cut once.

103
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,439
       Haste makes waste.

104
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,741
        Slow and steady.

105
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,510
Emphasis on the slow.

106
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:56,655
          Rainbow Dash!

107
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,124
You can't build an
apple shed like that!

108
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,727
           Oh, yeah? I just did!

109
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,065
Whoa! No way!

110
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,434
           All: Whoa!

111
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,587
          Impressive...

112
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,339
     if you can call an
     apple shed impressive.

113
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,475
Just 'cause it's fast
don't mean it's good.

114
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,743
            Oh, sorry!
            Can't hear you.

115
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,247
       Too busy practicing my
      Teacher of the Month pose.

116
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,915
                Yeah! Yeah!

117
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,318
                  Hoo wah!

118
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,620
Don't count your pictures before
 they're snapped, Rainbow Dash.

119
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,289
                    Oh, come on!

120
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,257
       These students are
       totally gonna vote

121
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,326
        for a teacher who
        gets things done!

122
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,495
        No, they're gonna
       vote for a teacher

123
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,464
   who gets things done right!

124
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,001
Yeah, this isn't awkward at all.

125
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:56,281
   Applejack: Steady, steady.

126
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,184
     Take her nice and slow.

127
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,121
       Little to the left.

128
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,726
      A hair to the right.

129
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,163
    Now a hoofshavin' higher.

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,633
             Grrrr.

131
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,234
   JUST BRING IT DOWN ALREADY!

132
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,208
          Heh heh.

133
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,012
  I'll give ya one guess whose
   side is still standin.'

134
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,547
                  Yak side!

135
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,687
         Um, professors?

136
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,523
I'm a little confused
about teamwork now.

137
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,593
     That's because you need
      a different teacher.

138
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,795
                   Follow me!

139
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,496
         Last one to the stream
         is a rotten apple shed!

140
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,365
            Grr.

141
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,369
  Who's ready to smash the all-
  time Equestria speed record

142
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,771
       for river canoeing?

143
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,775
           Is that even a thing?

144
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,328
First I've heard of it.

145
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:01,680
 We need to get to the finish
line before this alarm goes off!

146
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,548
 That means you gotta move fast!

147
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:11,957
         Any questions?

148
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,425
        Um. Yona have questions.

149
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,127
        No time for 'em!
        Get in the boat.

150
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,566
You really think winnin'
some canoin' record

151
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,036
is gonna get you that
teacher of the month trophy?

152
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,539
I'm pretty sure every creature's
   gonna like it a lot better

153
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,575
       than pounding nails
        and cutting wood.

154
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,148
       Yak not like water.

155
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,752
  Sometimes, when I'm scared to
  try something new, I whistle.

156
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,160
We got you, Yona.

157
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,733
Way I see it, Twilight's gonna
give that teachin' trophy

158
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,602
to a TEACHER, not a RACER.

159
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,871
           We'll see about that.

160
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,143
 Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder!

161
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,779
 Put your back into it, newbies!

162
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:15,420
Stroooke, stroooke,
stroooke, slower!

163
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,723
Focus on your paddle
technique, y'all!

164
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,826
            WHOO HOO!

165
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,028
     We're really going now!

166
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,902
      So, when do we get to
     the part when we move?

167
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,175
        When everycreature
         starts listening to <i>me</i>.

168
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,945
            The leader of my
            activity, Applejack.

169
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,483
                  NOW STROKE!

170
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,361
          Dig in team!

171
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,263
 We can still beat that record!

172
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,066
              Stop!

173
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,435
               Go!

174
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,070
       Which way do we go?

175
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,271
              Left!

176
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,172
             Right!

177
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,072
       Aye-aye, captains!

178
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,175
           Wait, what?

179
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,210
              Left!

180
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,544
      I can see the finish
       line from here!

181
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,448
If we go left, we'll
be headin straight

182
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,117
into the Bite-acuda fish!

183
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,252
   Who cares about a few fish?

184
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,821
         Uh, professors?

185
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,156
You'll care plenty
when they bite ya!

186
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,174
              Guys?

187
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,891
    Rainbow Dash: We'll just
     go around them.

188
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,194
              ROCK!

189
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,784
       I LOVE FIELD TRIPS!

190
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,788
I hope you're happy.

191
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,125
  Obviously not, because there
   goes our new speed record!

192
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,731
              Help!

193
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,366
          Yak not swim!

194
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,790
           That's OK.

195
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,241
     Your friends can change
     into creatures that do!

196
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,949
       Twilight: How's the
       canoeing..... going?

197
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,453
      About as good as the
      apple shed building.

198
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,722
      I totally had things
        under control,

199
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,424
 until Applejack messed 'em up.

200
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,725
I did not!

201
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:35,960
                    Did too!

202
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,162
            Did not!

203
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,631
              Yeah. It's been
              like this all day.

204
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,534
                  I wouldn't say
                   all day.

205
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,204
                Just, 99% of it.

206
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,409
      I can't believe this!

207
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,144
  You're not teaching teamwork;

208
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,646
        you're competing
        with each other.

209
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,581
  I thought you were past that!

210
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,183
                         We are!

211
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,884
                        Mostly...

212
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,552
    We got carried away with

213
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,922
    wantin' to be the Teacher
      of the Month, is all.

214
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,556
The Teacher of the
Month wouldn't care

215
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,225
about being the
Teacher of the Month!

216
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,760
I know Fluttershy
would be thrilled

217
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,261
to see another pony win.

218
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,529
           That's it!

219
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,464
I'm taking over
this field trip.

220
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,069
       Hold up, Twilight.

221
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,971
  Don't count out Rainbow Dash
     for the award just yet.

222
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,274
 You should've seen her fire up
 those students to build a shed!

223
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,211
         No way! <i>You're</i> the one
         the students listen to.

224
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,849
      Besides, you saved us from
        those pony-eating fish.

225
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:34,637
                   Long story.

226
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:38,022
 But Applejack should definitely
  be teacher of the month.

227
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,427
Hmmm. Maybe you two have
learned something after all.

228
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,930
  Does that mean you'll give us
another chance at the Teacher of the--

229
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:47,465
                   --Field Trip?

230
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,035
             Well...

231
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,238
                C'mon, Twilight.
                  We get it.

232
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,439
                No more arguing.

233
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,607
               Right, Applejack?

234
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,709
        Right as rain and
         twice as fresh!

235
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,613
    Fine.

236
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,448
But I'm picking the next
activity you two lead.

237
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,749
A nature walk.

238
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,285
Nopony could possibly
argue over that.

239
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:08,553
   Right?

240
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:09,888
                  Right!

241
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,922
     See?

242
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,624
     We're agreein' already!

243
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,000
       Well, look at that!

244
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,369
    The path splits up ahead.

245
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,871
         Left or right?

246
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,809
        Here we go again.

247
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,344
     Where to, Rainbow Dash?

248
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,447
      I was thinking right.

249
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,782
   Unless you want to go left.

250
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,886
     Because what makes you
     happy, makes me happy.

251
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,355
   Ah, heck, forget about me.

252
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,791
      Applejack: You want to go right,
       we'll go right.

253
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:52,097
Rainbow Dash: But teamwork means listening to
other ponies, so it's up to you.

254
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,400
     Applejack: Well, aren't you as
     sweet as sugar apple pie.

255
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,902
       But it's up to you.

256
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,237
        Grrrr. Follow me.

257
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,638
       Yak know best way.

258
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,543
     Hey, where y'all goin'?

259
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,363
    I think we've gone in the
     same circle five times.

260
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,866
    Only because 'SOMEponies'
    won't make up their minds

261
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,635
     about which way to go.

262
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,606
Do you want to keep going
in a circle, Applejack?

263
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,377
              Up to you, Rainbow
               Dash. I insist.

264
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,747
[chuckle] No no,<i> I</i> insist.

265
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:19,050
          Heh. But<i> I </i>insisted first.

266
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,252
  Are we still on a field trip?

267
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,554
Cause this just feels
like being lost.

268
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,497
      We can still get back
      to school before dark

269
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,133
     if we cross that ravine
     and stop doubling back.

270
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,669
We knew that.

271
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,239
All part of our plan,
right, Applejack?

272
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:46,311
       Uh.. yep. All we have to
      do is.... build a bridge

273
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,615
    across that.. giant canyon
      and we're home free!

274
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,885
    That is if, if you think
    a bridge is a good idea.

275
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,054
Only if you want
to build a bridge.

276
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,023
                     STOP!

277
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:00,791
      Listen, we can just fly
      everyone over and be done.

278
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,994
       Nope. There's still
         plenty of time

279
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,429
        to teach y'all a
       lesson in teamwork.

280
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,731
Cooperation!

281
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,032
                   Togetherness!

282
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,034
You are so right!

283
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,769
       Only as right as you are!

284
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,872
       OK! We'll build the
     bridge. What do we use?

285
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,240
Vines!                                               Branches!

286
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,776
Branches!                                        Vines!

287
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,645
I'm goin' with your idea: vines.

288
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,246
               No buts about it.

289
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,015
I'm building
with your idea.

290
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,217
Branches. End of story.

291
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,316
      Why use a branch when
      you could use a vine!

292
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,935
      Why didn't I think of
     branches to begin with?

293
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:17,802
          They're so...

294
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,205
      ...easy to work with.

295
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,615
    These here vines are just
    the thing, Rainbow Dash!

296
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:35,419
   Not to disagree, but these here
    branches are the way to--

297
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,961
              HELP!

298
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,233
      At least now they're
     agreeing on something.

299
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:59,844
[groaning] I can't get out!

300
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,112
                  Let me try.

301
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:12,823
Let me guess.

302
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,659
Bite-acudas?

303
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,899
       Mm hm. And they
       look mighty hungry.

304
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,601
      We gotta get our
    professors out of there!

305
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,436
    Anycreature have a plan?

306
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:26,938
              Leave 'em hanging?

307
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,372
     What!?

308
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,607
          I'm kidding...

309
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,076
                  Kinda.

310
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,944
       We need to work
       fast, and together.

311
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,281
        But mainly fast.

312
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,754
   I hate to admit it, but...

313
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,857
       this whole mess is
        kinda our fault.

314
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,929
Yeah. No trophy is worth
   getting eaten over.

315
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,898
  So whaddya say, ya wanna team
     up and get ourselves

316
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,666
 outta this here pickle barrel?

317
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,735
   I thought you'd never ask!

318
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,904
              Ahhh!!

319
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,039
          Don't worry!

320
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,373
    I'm just the distraction.

321
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,409
            Ocellus..?

322
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,578
      You nearly scared the
       cutie marks off us!

323
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,062
          Need a lift?

324
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,770
           Yak smash!

325
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,247
    Welcome back, Professors!

326
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,750
     Now that was a rescue!

327
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,718
   And y'all did it together!

328
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,758
       No big. Those fish
      weren't even a thing.

329
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,427
   Wha'!

330
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,729
          Heh heh. Oops. Sorry.

331
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:04,535
 Ha ha! BEST. FIELD TRIP. EVER!

332
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,118
     Huh?

333
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,576
How was the field trip?

334
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,846
     What did you all learn?

335
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,423
            Er....

336
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,715
     Yak learn ponies smart!

337
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,351
   Yeah! Professors Applejack
     and Rainbow Dash

338
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,953
    were such good teachers.

339
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,222
   It was kinda crazy genius.

340
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,390
     They showed us what not
      to do so we'd figure

341
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,825
     out what we should do.

342
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,128
             Really?

343
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,463
It took us a
while to get it.

344
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,398
    Especially at the ravine.

345
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,435
   It would have been so much
   easier to just fly home.

346
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:41,138
   But instead, our professors
   built bridges the wrong way

347
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,808
     just to show us how
     important teamwork is.

348
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,110
 Yeah, that was super-dangerous.

349
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,678
     Talk about commitment!

350
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:52,817
We know it's too early to
pick the Teacher of the Month.

351
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,921
But we'd like you to consider
Rainbow Dash and Applejack.

352
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,789
    Thank you for telling me!

353
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,726
    I'm so glad to hear your
    field trip was a success.

354
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,728
   I'll make sure to schedule
   another one right away!

355
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:12,637
You were actually just competing
 the entire time, weren't you?

356
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,705
      To tell ya the truth?

357
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,107
              Yeah.

358
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,542
Well, not <i>all</i> the time.

359
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,878
I agreed with you for
the whole nature walk!

360
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,181
 Only cause you were anglin' for
that Teacher of the Month award.

361
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,318
YOU were the one
doing the angling.
