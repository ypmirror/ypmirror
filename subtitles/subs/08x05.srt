1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,106
  I'm so glad I made it to Las
   Pegasus before the fastest,

2
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,742
     most thrilling ride of
    all time closes for good!

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,613
Wait. The fastest, most
thrilling ride of all time?

4
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:19,251
       She hasn't heard of
     "The Wild Blue Yonder"?

5
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,421
   [scoff] Of course, I have!

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,523
    It's that one where uh...

7
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,959
     All right, you got me.
      What is it?

8
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,196
            Only the coolest
            roller coaster ever!

9
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:32,664
          Pfft. You can't really call
           yourself a Wonderbolt

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,366
                  if you haven't
                    been on it.

11
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,975
    Oh, it looks incredible!

12
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,643
                      Oh, it is.

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:48,013
 First, you strap yourself into
  the cloud rocket car

14
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,449
   and then you're catapulted
       straight through...

15
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,220
     a series of daring dips
     and terrifying turns...

16
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,056
         flipping upside
       down so many times,

17
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,357
       you don't know
       which way is up...

18
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,464
 till finally, you climb to the
  highest peak on the rails...

19
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,833
      then drop towards the
    ground at lightning speed

20
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,502
       before coming up to
       a screeching halt!

21
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,005
        It's the coolest
       ride ever to exist

22
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:15,808
  in the history of Equestria!

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,011
        So.. when did you ride it?

24
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,547
Oh. Heh heh. I haven't.

25
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,926
   The ride closes this week!
       Forever!

26
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,928
  But I can't go to Las Pegasus

27
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,763
     because I have to teach
      at Twilight's school.

28
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,698
      I'm going to miss out

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,002
      on the coolest roller
      coaster of all time!

30
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,704
                  Unless...

31
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,041
Why do I feel like you're about
to ask me a mighty big favor?

32
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,275
    Can you cover my classes?

33
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,078
           Absolutely.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,046
                Really? Awesome!

35
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,718
On one condition.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,155
You tag along with a few other
ponies goin' to Las Pegasus.

37
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:43,395
     [laughter] Surely you don't
      mean Granny Smith?

38
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,064
No, no. Of course not!

39
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:49,335
I mean Granny Smith and the rest
of the "Gold Horseshoe Gals!"

40
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,137
Hurry yer haunches, Hinnies!

41
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,942
    Grand-Auntie Apple Sauce,

42
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,510
       Cousin Apple Rose,

43
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,612
  and Cousin Goldie Delicious!

44
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,849
Why, I'm sure they'd be plum
tickled to have ya join

45
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,685
their annual Grandmares'
trip to Las Pegasus.

46
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,120
It'll be perfect!

47
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,922
I'll teach your classes, and
you can look after them for me.

48
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,092
                [thwack] Look after them!?

49
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,960
So they don't get
too carried away.

50
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,162
Usually, Big Mac goes
along as a chaperone,

51
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,964
but I'm sure he'd
love a break.

52
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,871
  There is NO way I'm going to
   Las Pegasus with a bunch of

53
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,173
       old, slow grannies!

54
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,942
So you don't mind
missing your only chance

55
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,312
to ride The Wild Blue Yonder?

56
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,849
                Fine! I'll go.

57
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,551
Hah! That's the spirit!

58
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,553
Now skedaddle so I can
help 'em get ready.

59
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:46,625
Granny: Applejack! Have you seen
  my Cranky Flank cream?

60
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,229
     I can't find it in this
    whole tootin' farmhouse!

61
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,431
                It's uh... gonna
                 take a while.

62
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,073
             Urghh.

63
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,542
   Why is this taking so long?

64
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,077
       The Wild Blue
      Yonder's gonna close

65
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,679
       before we even get
         to Las Pegasus!

66
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,715
Here, I made a list to help
ya keep the grandmares

67
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:12,784
out of trouble.

68
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,219
Don't want to have to
bring 'em back home

69
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,321
before you get to go
on yer roller coaster!

70
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,889
              That could happen!?

71
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,425
Only if you don't
follow the rules!

72
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,494
These grannies
need a lot of care.

73
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,762
   If one of 'em overdoes it,

74
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,364
it's bye bye Las Pegasus
for the lot of ya.

75
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,635
                "Make sure they
               get their naps...

76
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,937
          eat only soft foods...

77
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,739
         careful when dancing...

78
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,907
         don't get too excited"!?

79
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:36,942
           Seriously!?

80
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,112
And don't let 'em out
of your sight. Ever.

81
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,615
    Wait. Then how am I supposed
    to go on the roller coaster?

82
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,685
 You'll find time. And you might
    even learn a thing or two

83
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,154
    about havin' a good time
      from these old gals.

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,193
           Yeah, that'll happen.

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,161
                      All right,
                        y'all.

86
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,963
               Time to get this
               show on the road.

87
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,432
                  Heh. Or in the sky,
                   in this case.

88
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,238
              Ugh!

89
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,240
   Come on, come on!

90
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,750
         Go go go go go!

91
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,267
      Agh!

92
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,902
Everypony OK
in there?

93
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,771
        Dandy as a pansy
         in a plant pot!

94
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:44,576
 You know, this hot air balloon
   ride reminds me of the time

95
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,145
        I climbed a tree!

96
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,547
Have I ever told you that story?

97
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,216
Only about a million times!

98
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,319
           HUH? What did ya say?

99
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,222
      They said they've
      heard the tree story!

100
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,526
        Oh, you want to
        hear the tree story? OK!

101
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,928
        Here we go again..

102
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,198
 Back when I was a young filly,
 I was afraid of tree-climbing!

103
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,601
        Knees knocking,
       hooves sweating...

104
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,670
        Have you ever had
        the hoof sweats?

105
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,939
       Well, they're just
        the worst thing.

106
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,209
    You know, Cousin Strudel,
     she used to get em too.

107
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,078
    Now, of course she was a
    champion fritter thrower-

108
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:36,028
      The Wild Blue Yonder
        is IN OUR HOTEL?

109
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,665
     Uh, I bet you grannies
     are feeling super tired

110
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,067
       from your journey.

111
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,235
     Nope. How about a
    trot down the avenue

112
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,804
to see the
sights, girls?

113
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,072
          Oh, forget the sights!

114
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,075
        I came here to play some
         serious horseshoe toss!

115
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,011
Oh, can we see the rainbow
fountains at the water show?

116
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,746
They're so magical.

117
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,750
   My pores are crying for a mud
   mask at the Prism Palace spa!

118
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,422
       You know what would
         be REALLY FUN?

119
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,190
      Relaxing in our room!

120
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,226
     C'mon! Last one to the
    hotel is a rotten apple!

121
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,632
Lemme get that for ya.

122
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,008
        Omigosh, omigosh,
        omigosh, omigosh!

123
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,309
          There it is..

124
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,811
  The best rollercoaster ever!

125
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:31,517
 Oow! Warm up those withers, ladies!

126
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,454
   There's a horseshoe hurling
  trophy with our names on it!

127
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:43,262
       [ghostly voice] Don't let
         them get too excited.

128
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,698
         Or you'll have
         to go home!

129
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,401
        [gasp] Whoa, whoa, whoa,

130
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,037
           That sounds a
            little too exciting.

131
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,173
            Why don't we get you
              checked in first?

132
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:03,114
 Oh, my, you are a strong
 pony, aren't you, Sugar Hocks?

133
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,219
              Ugh.

134
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,226
       Welcome to our Gold
        Horseshoe suite!

135
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:18,030
    Only the best of the best
    for our favorite guests.

136
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,667
      Which of course means
        you lovely mares.

137
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,169
Why, thank ya a
bushel and a peck,

138
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,439
you scrumptious morsel
o' frosted carrot cake!

139
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,408
                 Oh, uh... Thank
                   you, ma'am.

140
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,516
   I think he was sweet on me.
   Maybe I should ask him

141
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,018
     to accompany me to the
       magic show tonight.

142
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,153
            Bah hah!

143
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,655
        Sure your name's
        not Apple Saucy?

144
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,424
     Better find the brakes
      on that buggy, sugar!

145
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,576
        We just got here!

146
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,727
  You're right. Better see what
    else is out there first.

147
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,631
 The day is young and I am not!

148
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,471
Uh. Granny Smith's right!
Let's not overdo it.

149
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,878
   How about a nice nap so you
  can really enjoy Las Pegasus?

150
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,915
 Good idea!

151
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:13,652
We could use some
shut-eye, hm?

152
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,186
           But I'm not tired....

153
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,721
                      Oh! Right!

                     Uh, yawn...

155
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:25,430
You go along now and explore
while we rest, sugar booger.

156
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,765
Yawn.

157
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,733
         If you say so!

158
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,472
        What? They'll be
        in here sleeping

159
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,806
         the whole time
          I'm gone.

160
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,143
        Quit judging me!

161
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,352
    [Ahem] One ticket for the
     coolest roller coaster

00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,462
                  I know, right?

165
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,264
     Good thing we can just
       stand here all day

  without any responsibilities
    waiting for us!

00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,771
Oh, hey, thanks!

168
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,640
         Enjoy the ride.

169

Heh. They didn't
even know I left.

Have you seen a group of
old mares around here?

183
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,961
  Lady, you just described half
    the ponies in this place.

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,310
Can good ole Goldie Delicious
and the Gold Horseshoe Gals

189

break the all-time
resort record, folks?

    Pretty much the
   opposite right now.

        Or go shopping for hats!

00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,189
   Have I ever told you about
    the time I got a new hat

215
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,793
     and it turned out
   to be a bird? Ha ha ha ha.

    soft carrot soup instead?

     go to our room and put
    on eyemasks and earplugs?

   I'd rather hit the club and
    show off my dance moves.

       it comes to rhumba.

     enough dancing for now!

So each pony could
have some alone time?

00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,940
        Trust me, you'll
         love this show.

279
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,309
       It's the best thing
       in Las Pegasus.

280
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,377
            Whoo hoo!

281
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:23,481
Oh, hey, thanks for giving
me your place in line!

282
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,184
They said I'm one of
the last ponies ever

283
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,386
to ride the Wild
 Blue Yonder!

284
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,970
     And now, for the trick
      that made us famous.

285
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:50,241
   The most dangerous magical
     feat known to ponykind.

286
00:16:55,782 --> 00:17:01,386
  We'd like to invite some very
   special mares to the stage.

287
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,954
          That's our cue, girls!

288
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,991
       Hey! Where are you going?

289
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,192
                      Come back!

290
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,503
   Meet our lovely assistants.

291
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,642
        They will make a
       Splashtastic Escape

292
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,378
   using only the instructions
      we give them...

293
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,180
         with our minds!

294
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,883
Don't try this at home, folks!

295
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,963
                Do I really have
                to say anything?

296
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,933
        Release those
       grannies right now!

297
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,709
     [sploosh]
   [shouts from the audience]

298
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,247
What'd ya go and do that for?

299
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,450
That was our big star moment!

300
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,951
             You were in danger!

301
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,286
                I saw the water!

302
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,453
               You were trapped!

303
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,821
Oh, pish tosh!

304
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,757
This is a magic show.

305
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,859
We've seen it a
thousand times.

306
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,827
Everypony always escapes.

307
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,899
      That's right, folks!

308
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,836
  Because of our.. um... uh...
   skill as magicians!

309
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,305
    And now, a disappearing act!

310
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,177
   Well, I hope you're happy.

311
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,880
 We've been waiting to be picked
   as the lovely assistants

312
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,449
    in that trick for years!

313
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,585
    You keep ruining our fun!

314
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,487
     I had a hot hoof goin'
       in that game

315
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,922
   you decided to lose for us!

316
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:47,592
    And I wanted to eat those
     nachos at the buffet.

317
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,594
      And I could have torn
       up the dance floor,

318
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,863
          if you didn't
        keep stopping me.

319
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:55,500
    They're being too polite
      to say it, so I will.

320
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,202
      Rainbow Dash, we
    thought you'd be a hoot,

321
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,404
        but I ain't never
        met a wetter hen!

322
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,605
    What?!

323
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,507
                    She's right.

324
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,076
    You've had your mane in a
    twist ever since we arrived.

325
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,412
Is something the
matter, dear?

326
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,615
    I'm so sorry, everypony!

327
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,618
  The truth is, all I've wanted
  to do for this whole trip is

328
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
   ride the Wild Blue Yonder!

329
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,190
   I mean, it's why I came to
 Las Pegasus in the first place!

330
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,226
    Applejack told me not to
    let you out of my sight,

331
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,096
   or you might overdo it and
   we'd have to go home early.

332
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,498
                 Applejack put
                 you up to this?

333
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,072
    Well, now it's too late.

334
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:37,375
     I ruined your trip and
     it's the last day ever

335
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,644
        to ride the Wild
          Blue Yonder.

336
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:43,781
    The line is so long,
   I'll never get to go on it.

337
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,153
      Hey! What's so funny?

338
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,889
     [chuckle] Is that all you wanted?

339
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,058
       Well, fish-flavored
         kitten-kibble.

340
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,860
  Why didn't you say so sooner?

341
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,796
         Come on, girls!

342
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,072
 We're "Gold Horseshoe" members!

343
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,809
      The most exclusive
      club in Las Pegasus.

344
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,544
       And she's with us.

345
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,350
  We've been comin' here every
   moon since we can remember.

346
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,219
  Even some we don't remember!

347
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,289
  It definitely has its perks.

348
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,292
      Like fancy suites and
      roller coaster rides?

349
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,860
          That's right!

350
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,163
       And I hope you like
      riding in the front.

351
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:33,964
            Um, YES!

352
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,635
       [giggle] This is amazing!

353
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,770
       Isn't this amazing?

354
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:42,106
    Sugar. You probably want
      to hold on 'bout now.

355
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,149
                       Whoo hoo!

356
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,957
    I'm sorry I misjudged you
     for being older ponies.

357
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,293
      You mares are
      actually pretty cool.

358
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,627
          Rainbow Dash?

359
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,829
                   Yeah, Granny?

360
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,865
   The gals and I have
    been talkin' and well...

361
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,101
         we think you're
        a hoot after all.

362
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,703
   We'd like to invite you to
    become a permanent member

363
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,306
     of the "Gold Horseshoe
         Gals"! Hoo hoo!

364
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,710
            O-oh! Really!?

365
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,579
             Mm hm.

366
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,581
Same time next year?

367
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,717
I wouldn't miss it for anything.
