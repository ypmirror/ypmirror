00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:06,538
 <i> Dear Twilight, it is difficult</i>
<i> to express how grateful I am</i>

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,709
   <i> to you for teaching me the</i>
  <i> power of friendship.</i>

3
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:16,281
   <i> You would think after more</i>
     <i> than a thousand years,</i>

4
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,750
     <i> there would be nothing</i>
     <i> left to learn</i>

5
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:31,163
 <i> And yet, even a pony as old as</i>
 <i> I can continue to be surprised</i>

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,832
       <i> by how much there</i>
       <i> is to know.</i>

7
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,315
     "I hope you find these
      postcards enjoyable

8
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,317
     and I look forward to
       seeing you again,

9
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,154
   though I can't say when my
   journey will be complete.

10
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,189
    Your friend, Starswirl."

11
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,062
 It must be gratifying to have
   your idol writing to you

12
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,265
     about the friendship
     lessons he's learning.

13
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,167
       I'm not sure I'll
      ever get used to it.

14
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,436
 Of course, if he really wants
  to learn about friendship,

15
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,372
       he could just come
         to our school..

16
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,407
       Professor Sparkle?

17
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,312
    The Mail Pony just came
    with uh, a few things.

18
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:25,151
    Oo! The sewing machines
    I ordered for my class!

19
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,787
        These came, too.

20
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:29,755
       I wasn't sure what
        to make of them.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,227
  These machines were costly,

22
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,129
     but I am quite certain
     the friendship lessons

23
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,065
  I can teach my students with
    them will be invaluable.

24
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,268
     Oh don't worry, darling.

25
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,369
    I'll think of something

26
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,371
    and I didn't use school
    funds to buy these.

27
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,108
    I made the purchase
   entirely with my own bits.

28
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,643
   It's not that. It's this!

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,780
    "Why waste your time at
      a friendship school

30
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,181
     that's just a school?

31
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:01,220
Learn everything they teach and
more at Friendship <i>University!?</i>"

32
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,528
    Who would open
   another friendship school?

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,931
     Oh pffft. I'm sure it's nothing
        to worry about.

34
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,899
      You're the Princess
        of Friendship.

35
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,068
     What could this other
     school possibly offer?

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,406
It isn't just another friendship
school, it's a University!

37
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,976
       It says they teach
       "the same lessons

38
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:59,444
      of competing schools
       in half the time."

39
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,146
        That's twice the
        learning!

40
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,515
    And it's in Las Pegasus?

41
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,586
If Professor Rarity lets us skip
 her sewing class -- ROAD TRIP!

42
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,491
     I think we need to
     look into this school.

43
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,862
     I don't like to judge
     solely on appearances,

44
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:21,133
    but.. what kind of
   friendship school is this!?

45
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,869
    Only the best friendship
     school in the West...

46
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:26,405
  and maybe all of Equestria!

47
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,553
  There's more ponies in here
   than at our whole school.

48
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,289
   Who is running this place?

49
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,691

00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,884
          Accredited?

104
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,220
      It means officially
    recognized or authorized.

105
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,888
     We know what it means.

106
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,124
      But who would
      accredit this place?

107
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,027
    Why the EEA, of course!

108
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,697
      Chancellor Neighsay?

109
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,000
   The Equestria Educational
   Association has taken an

110
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:45,204
    interest in institutions
    that teach friendship

111
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,773
  in a pony-first environment.

112
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,374
       Surely you didn't
       think your school

113
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,643
       has a monopoly on
         the concept?

114
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,179
      Well, she did write
        the book on it.

115
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,514
            Ah, yes.

116
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,183
     "How to teach
    friendship to <i>creatures</i>

117
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,920
   who will one day use it as
     a weapon against us."

118
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,323
      How could they use
    friendship as a weapon?

119
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,858
  You tell me; it's your book.

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,062
   Meantime, this university
appears to be a promising option

121
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:15,534
for ponies who'd prefer to stick
to the EEA book on the subject.

122
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,236
     You can't be serious.

123
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:19,204
       They're obviously
       up to something.

124
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,806
      It's Flim and Flam!

125
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,077
      Well, that certainly
      wasn't.. friendly.

126
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,181
  One would think the headmare
   of a school of friendship,

127
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:33,152
  albeit an unaccredited one,
   would behave differently.

128
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:38,590
   Unless she was trying to
undermine the competition? Hmm?

129
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,028
   I... No... What? I am not!

130
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,597
  I did think the Princess of
Friendship would be friendlier.

131
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,733
        Now, now fillies
        and gentlecolts,

132
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:51,203
    let's show the Princess
    just how friendly we are

133
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,339
       by signing up for
       some classes!

134
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,248
  Why don't I show you around?

135
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,122
  I'm sorry, but approval from
   the EEA won't convince me

136
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,124
      that this school is
       what you promise.

137
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:15,261
     And what would it
     take to convince you?

138
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:18,930
   Well, somepony who's
  opinion I respect, for one.

139
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:24,037
  Really? Somepony like... this?

140
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,040
           Twilight?

141
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,774
             Uh oh.

142
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,582
      Starswirl? What are
        you doing here?

143
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:41,553
Why, studying friendship at Flim
and Flam's wonderful school!

144
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,888
          Oh, please..

145
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,290
    I think I know a
    disguise when I see one.

146
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,592
         Take off that
       ridiculous beard!

147
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,228
             FLAM!

148
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,131
    How's it going in here?

149
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,003
      Oh.. It-it's really me.

150
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,439
        I'd heard rumors
        you've returned,

151
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,641
      but I didn't believe
       it until now.

152
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,410
     And if a pony of your
   stature is studying here,

153
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,714
  there really isn't anything
  else I need to see.

154
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:14,286
    I, Chancellor Neighsay,
 hereby confer upon Friendship

155
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:19,858
 University complete and
 unreserved EEA accreditation!

156
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,029
     I-I don't understand.

157
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,765
    Why would you come
    here and not my school?

158
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,067
       My travels brought
       me to Las Pegasus.

159
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,635
 I didn't come for the school,

160
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,772
  but Flim and Flam convinced
   me to try it out.

161
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,807
      Twilight: You can't
      trust Flim and Flam!

162
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,510
     They tried to con the
   Apples out of their farm!

163
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,145
  They sold fake health tonic!

164
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,281
       They run a resort
        in Las Pegasus!

165
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,251
    Technically, our resort
   is a legitimate business.

166
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,153
    I spent a thousand years

167
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,856
       thinking the worst
        of a "bad" pony.

168
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,258
     You taught me to look
     for the best in him.

169
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,694
       Whatever Flim and
      Flam's past may be,

170
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:59,332
starting this school shows they
want to change for the better.

171
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,401
  I wish I could believe that.

172
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,636
 Besides, what's untrustworthy

173
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,738
     about opening a
     school of friendship?

174
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,308
     They don't even
      charge for classes.

175
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,976
         I don't know.

176
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,511
       But I know they're
       up to something

177
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,664
     and until I find out,

178
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:17,016
     I'm begging you, come
     to my school instead.

179
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:22,220
   I understand feeling
   threatened by competition.

180
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:26,625
   But my word, Princess, I
   wonder if the ill-manners

181
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:30,362
   of the creatures at your
   school aren't contagious.

182
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,499
  I think I will take my leave
   before I become infected.

183
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,704
    Twilight, I promise I'll
    visit your school soon,

184
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:44,476
   but for now, perhaps it's
   best if you return there.

185
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,048
You don't think they're running
 an actual friendship school,

186
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,049
            do you?

187
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,251
    Darling, of course not.

188
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:54,886
        Which is why we
      have to investigate!

189
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,355
     But we can't go poking
       around the school.

190
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,923
       Everypony'll think
       I'm still just

191
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,659
        "threatened by
       the competition."

192
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:04,730
        Only if we do it
         as.. <i>ourselves.</i>

193
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,704
      In these disguises,

194
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,006
   we could pass as students
    at out own school.

195
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,459
     I don't know, Rarity.

196
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,611
  Ah-ah. What did I say about
   using our real names?

197
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:26,151
     Sorry, "Plainity." But
      I'm pretty sure this..

198
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,119
  isn't enough of a disguise.

199
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,624
      Hey, strangers. Are
       you two new here?

200
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,460
  We sure are. Completely new!

201
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,862
    Great! See you in class!

202
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,833
  Now, I've read enough Shadow
 Spade to know the key to going

203
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,370
    undercover is rehearsing
      your backstory.

204
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:50,341
   I'm "Plainity" and I love
   bland-old-normal stuff.

205
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,876
       No frills for me.

206
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,079
         OK! Heh. Your turn.

207
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,649
  [groan] My name's Eyepatch.
      I have an eyepatch.

208
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,317
            Per-fect!

209
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,654
      Now, how do we start
       our investigation?

210
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,755
  I think we should split up.

211
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:04,923
   You enroll in some classes

212
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,892
   and find out what they're
   actually teaching.

213
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,960
      I'll look around and
      see what I can find,

214
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,463
  assuming I'm not recognized....

215
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,999
   Welcome, newest students!

216
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,668
 Let's dive right in, shall we?

217
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,770
   One of the most important
    elements of friendship

218
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,606
      is being thoughtful,
      true or false?

219
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:28,113
   If by thoughtful you mean
    generous, I'd say true.

220
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,981
            Correct! Ha hah!

221
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,216
    It was a trick question.

222
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,084
    Very impressive, Ms...?

223
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,336
           Plainity.

224
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:37,087
 Well, well well, Ms. Plainity,
 keep it up and you'll be ready

225
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,558
 for our next level in no time!

226
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,396
   Now, let's see if you can
   demonstrate for the class.

227
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:49,067
 What's something generous you
  could do for me right now?

228
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,212
     Class, Plainity here
     is now my star pupil.

229
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,449
  If any of you want a chance
  at studying with Starswirl,

230
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,652
       I'd take notes on
       her every action.

231
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,727
             Hello?

232
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,762
 The door is open, so I'll just
 assume it's OK to come in

233
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:21,233
    and look around, unless
    somepony says it's not.

234
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,801
        All right, then.

235
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,842
    "The Element of Laughter
     and its applications."

236
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,178
 OK, that seems pretty genuine.

237
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,648
     "When to support your
      friends' decisions

238
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,183
    and when to talk sense."

239
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,320
      Huh, that's actually
      kind of interesting.

240
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,157
      Ah-ha! "Friendship
     University's true goal

241
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,662
    is to help friends
    become better friends?"

242
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,697
    Where is the proof
     that it's all a scam?

243
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,799
       There isn't any...

244
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,471
       Twilight Sparkle!

245
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:03,107
Did you really think an eye
patch was enough of a disguise?

246
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,643
         No, I didn't!

247
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,012
   Well then, we agree that
  everypony will recognize the

248
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:11,049
     Princess of Friendship
     in this photo of you

249
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,485
   sneaking into our office.

250
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,656
    I can see the headline
  now, "Princess of Jealousy!

251
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:21,326
   Twilight Sparkle bent on
   ruining her competition!"

252
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,794
So sad.

253
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,765
   A news story like that
 would destroy your reputation.

254
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:31,870
   Nopony will want to go to
    your school after that.

255
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:41,112
    Just wait until the
   papers get a hold of this.

256
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,247
       Princess Unhinged!

257
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,283
It'll be the talk of Equestria.

258
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:49,120
    Well, gentleponies, I've
    finished another stack.

259
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,457
The lessons in these worksheets
    are quite fascinating.

260
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,792
        Twilight? What's
         going on here?

261
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,963
 Oh, just your protégé getting
 caught snooping in our office

262
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,467
  in disguise! Well, sort of.

263
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:07,572
Oh honestly, Princess Twilight,
envy does not look good on you.

264
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,508
        I'm not envious!

265
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,477
      I know these two
      are up to something.

266
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,546
        I'm just trying
       to find out what!

267
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:18,116
  The only pony I see who's up
    to something is the pony

268
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:21,686
   in this picture, and it is
    not the Princess I know.

269
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,259
 Well, it's about to be the
Princess all of Equestria knows.

270
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,979
           Unless...

271
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,998
 you decided to drop the whole,
 "uncover the scam" thing.

272
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,701
   Then we'll rip this silly
   picture up and not let it

273
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,038
    completely and utterly
   ruin you and your school.

274
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,376
    You can be generous with
      all sorts of things.

275
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,779
 Gifts, compliments, your time.

276
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,251
         Hey, Eyepatch!

277
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,319
     Where's your eyepatch?

278
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,054
     [gasp] Was your cover blown?

279
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,522
      You could say that.

280
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,925
Flim and Flam took a picture of
me sneaking into their office.

281
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,028
 Were we wearing our eye patch?

282
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,331
If I don't stop investigating,
they're going to tell everypony

283
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,032
      that I'm trying to
     sabotage their school

284
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,300
      because I'm jealous.

285
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,335
         But but but...

286
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,803
       that's ridiculous!

287
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:12,738
         I don't know.

288
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,072
    Maybe I am just upset
    that Starswirl came here

289
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,574
     instead of my school.

290
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,077
    Flim and Flam may have
    turned over a new leaf.

291
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,213
We should probably just go home.

292
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,615
     Twilight, you are not
     the kind of pony

293
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,584
     to let your emotions
     cloud your judgement.

294
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,853
   If you think Flim and
    Flam are up to no good,

295
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:29,955
       you can't give up,

296
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,756
     even if their lessons
     really are impressive!

297
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,159
          Wait. WHAT?

298
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,928
   Which reminds me. Can you
    get a message to Spike?

299
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,863
        I want to return
     those sewing machines.

300
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,499
  I need the bits if I'm going
    to keep advancing here.

301
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,468
    Tuition's free, but the
    worksheets sure aren't!

302
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,975
       Flim and Flam are
      <i>charging</i> for these?

303
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,111
        Well, they have
       to cover expenses,

304
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,413
     and Flam insists that
     everything extra

305
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,082
       goes to improving
       the school and...

306
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,651
  This is the scam, isn't it?

307
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,419
        Let's find out!

308
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,624
       These lessons are
         so valuable.

309
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,560
       Are you sure I
      can't give you more?

310
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,561
     Ah ah ah! Unnecessary!

311
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,598
    Being able to share them
      with a pony like you

312
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,200
      is our real reward.

313
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:25,677
 Oh, my. And you want to study
 alongside Starswirl, hm?

314
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,846
        It's all I have.

315
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,788
    Come back for the rest
    when you can afford it.

316
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,324
      Wait! I'll sell the
      shirt off my back!

317
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,659
  Aaand that's the kind of
 determination that'll get you

318
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:45,129
   to the next level, student
    whose.. name I know!

319
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,836
  Twilight, maybe I should
  take over the investigation.

320
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,338
   Think of your reputation!

321
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
   My reputation isn't worth
    much if I won't risk it

322
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,275
   for what I think is right.

323
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,611
    Besides, I have a plan.

324
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:24,335
Well, brother of mine, we've got
 almost all the bits we need

325
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,804
     to expand our resort.

326
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:28,373
   If we add another level of
    classes and worksheets,

327
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,741
        we'll be there!

328
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:33,044
    Maybe we should add two
    levels, just to be safe.

329
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,219
  Ah! It's a thing of beauty.

330
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,453
      But I was thinking,

331
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:46,291
    what if we added another
    extreme pool slide here?

332
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,994
 Sure, as long as the pipes for
 the musical chocolate fountain

333
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,963
        go through.. here.

334
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,264
     Twilight: But
     shouldn't it go closer

335
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,566
         to the pudding
         hot tub <i>here</i>?

336
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,602
    Fair point, but-- WHAT?

337
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,004
 I knew your school was a scam!

338
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,040
       Well, well, well.

339
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,375
      If it isn't the
     Princess of Jealousy.

340
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,445
    I guess we'll be going
    to the papers after all.

341
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,647
    And I suppose I'll just
    lead your students

342
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,151
 into this secret room of bits
  and resort expansion plans!

343
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,487
      Err.. let's not get hasty.

344
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,424
   You have something on us;
   we have something on you.

345
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,559
    Let's just call it.. even.

346
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,727
       I don't think so.

347
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,996
   You can destroy my
    reputation if you want,

348
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:28,466
but using your students' bits to
  expand your resort is wrong,

349
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,935
    even if the lessons you
     teach are good ones.

350
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,403
    Of course, they're good.

351
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,839
 We copied them from <i>your</i> book.

352
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,541
        We just skipped
       every other page.

353
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,509
       "All the lessons,
        half the time!"

354
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,546
      Ugh. Fine. If you really
     want to call it even,

355
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,649
  give back the bits and stop
   charging for my lessons.

356
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,052
    Then you can teach them
     as much as you like.

357
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,855
  Nah! Running a school is
   more work than we thought.

358
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,392
    Besides, we almost have
      everything we need.

359
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:55,660
          I think not!

360
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,095
           Plainity?

361
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,130
         My star pupil?

362
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,032
      Not Plainity, but...

363
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,500
            Rarity!

364
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:03,535
              Who?

365
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,470
      We decided to bring
      somepony else here

366
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:08,006
    to listen to everything
     you just said!

367
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:13,010
      [mumble] Hey! Starswirl. We
      were just about to--

368
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,012
     Return the bits
     you've collected from

369
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:18,016
       your students and
       close your school?

370
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,151
       [gulp] Yeah. That.

371
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,160
       Ah, it seems I'll
      never stop learning

372
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,929
       from your example,
        Twilight.

373
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:34,666
It is a valuable lesson to stand
 up for what you know is true.

374
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,834
   I wish I had known it too.

375
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,836
 Thanks for returning our bits,

376
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,106
  but how are we going to
  learn about friendship now?

377
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:49,380
   Well, I can refer you to a
 fairly reputable establishment

378
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,349
   just outside of Ponyville.

379
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:55,453
 I'm quite certain the headmare
 would consider letting you in.

380
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,759
     "Of course, if I ever
     go to a school again,

381
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:05,696
   I'll make sure it's yours.
   In friendship, Starswirl."

382
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,865
    I still don't understand
    how Flim and Flam

383
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,701
     could have gotten
      a copy of your book.

384
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,870
   Uh. I finished straightening
     up in the library.

385
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,406
    Professor Rarity, I just
     wanted to make sure

386
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,408
       you're definitely
        keeping these.

387
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,010
    But of course, darling.

388
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,411
 If there's one thing I learned
 at Friendship University,

389
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,748
   it is not to give up when
   you know what's right

390
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,485
 and I know teaching friendship
 through sewing is right!

391
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,421
 I just need to figure out how...
