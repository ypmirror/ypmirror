1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,840
I hope Shining Armor
and Princess Cadance

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,980
don't think it's too
soon for me

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,070
to come back to the Crystal
Empire for a visit.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,540
But I just know Flurry Heart's
grown so much already.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,360
I wonder if I'll
even recognize her.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,440
She's the only baby
they have, Twilight.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,110
I think it'll be pretty easy
to figure out who she is.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,460
Mm.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,420
Sorry, I know you want to visit
your niece as much as possible

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,220
and I'm excited to
see Sunburst again.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,940
I just don't want
to fall behind

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,060
on my friendship
lessons back home.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,400
Starlight, your work in
Ponyville isn't going anywhere.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,100
Besides, I think we
all know you can learn

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,100
about friendship
anywhere, right Spike?

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,920
Spike? Who's Spike?

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,740
 Uh you're
Spike, Spike.

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,110
And why are you
dressed like that?

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,320
Guys! You're blowing my cover.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,780
How'd you even
know it was me?

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,300
Because you're YOU-- in
a coat, hat, and glasses.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,240
Also, we're the
only ones here.

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,460
Right.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,280
Spike, why do you
need a disguise?

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,560
The last time we came
to the Crystal Empire.

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,420
there was a lot going
on with the new baby

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,320
and the Crystalling,

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,040
but I still got
mobbed in the street.

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,120
I wouldn't say "mobbed."

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,740
And this is just
a family visit.

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,360
I wouldn't want the presence of
"Spike the Brave and Glorious"

32
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,380
to turn it into
some kind of circus.

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,380
We get it. The Crystal
Ponies adore you.

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,260
He did save the
Empire. Twice.

35
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,260
But still, I don't
think your presence

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
will turn our visit
into a circus.

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,140
Not if I find the right
disguise, it won't.

38
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:53,520

By YayPonies
We have crystal muffins!
https://yp1.yayponies.no/

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,000
Uh disguise or not, Spike, I
don't think you need to worry

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,140
about being mobbed.
Nopony's here.

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,480
It's like a ghost town.

42
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,660
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,180
Yeah, this is weird.

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,940
I guess I don't need
the disguise after all.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,260
It's Spike, the
Brave and Glorious!

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,200
He's come to save
us yet again!

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,780
Spike! Spike! Spike!

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,100
Save you from what?

49
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,300
Yeah. What's going on?

50
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,000
Why was everypony hiding?

51
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,040
It sure looks like Princess
Twilight and her pupil.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
But how can we be sure?

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,560
We can't. Either one of them
could be the-- you know.

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,320
What if this isn't
the real Spike!?

55
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,180
EVERYPONY RUN!

56
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,360
Awww!

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,160
OK. Something strange
is definitely going on.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
Ugh, you think?

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,780
Who goes there?

60
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,340
Um... you don't recognize
the Princess of Friendship?

61
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,500
Of course we recognize her.

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,060
But that doesn't
mean it's really her.

63
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,200
It's OK, guys.
They're with me.

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,500
And any friend of Spike
the Brave and Glorious

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,600
is a friend of the Crystal
Empire, am I right?

66
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,160
Huh. It does look like him.

67
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,960
Well, it would, wouldn't it?

68
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm sorry, but we'll need to see
some proof of identification.

69
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,340
<i> We'll take care of</i>
<i> things from here.</i>

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,710
Oh Cadance, thank
goodness! What's going on?

71
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,240
We can explain, Twilly
if it really is you.

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,960
"Sunshine, Sunshine--"

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,200
"--Lady bugs awake! Clap your
hooves and do a little shake!"

74
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,780
It's OK, everypony.
It's her.

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,420
Of course it's her.
What's all this about?

76
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,760
A Changeling's been
spotted nearby.

77
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,220
A Changeling!?

78
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,160
That's not good.

79
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,580
No. It's not.

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,180
After Queen Chrysalis took
my place at our wedding

81
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,400
and invaded Canterlot
with her army of minions,

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,820
we're not taking any chances.

83
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,900
Changelings feed off of love,

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,840
and ever since Flurry
Heart's Crystalling,

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,180
the Empire is filled with more
love than anywhere in Equestria.

86
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,300
It's possible they've
come for the baby.

87
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,060
That's why we've posted the
extra guards and why we're--

88
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,460
--checking
everypony's identity.

89
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm sorry for all of this.

90
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,980
Flurry Heart's really been
looking forward to seeing you.

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Oh! She's gotten so big!

92
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,180
Starlight and I will do whatever
we can to help protect her.

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,050
To be honest, having you
here is already a big relief.

94
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,980
The Royal Guards were
wondering if Spike,

95
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,120
the Brave and Glorious,

96
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,220
would like to join in the
search for the Changeling.

97
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,730
Really?

98
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,760
Uh, I don't know if that's
such a good idea, Spike.

99
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
It sounds dangerous.

100
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,620
Come on, Twilight. This is
Spike the Brave and Glorious

101
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,160
you're talking to. Have you ever
known me to run from danger?

102
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,780
Ummmm...

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,700
He'll be safe with our guards.

104
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,320
Or will your guards
be safe with me?

105
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,180
Spike, the Brave and Glorious.

106
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,200
You've faced the evil
Changelings before.

107
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,300
What can you tell us?

108
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,860
Oh. Um. Well, they are
Changelings, so they can change.

109
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,640
Do you hear that? These monsters
can look like any of us,

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,580
so be on guard, guards.
Even more than normal.

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,780
And they could be anywhere.

112
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,620
So we should cover as
much ground as possible.

113
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,620
You, search that way!

114
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,260
And you search that way!

115
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,660
And I'll just search
here, I guess.

116
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,600
Not many places to hide.

117
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,390
Unless that rock
is a Changeling.

118
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,160
OK, "rock", how do I know
you're really a rock?

119
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,600
Hmm not talking, huh?
Well, you can't fool me.

120
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,040
Whoa!

121
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,840
Whew.

122
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,420
OK. Maybe it's time Spike
the Brave and Glorious

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,840
went back to, ah,
protect those guards.

124
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Phew. Just my reflection.

125
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,560
Huh?

126
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,940
Ha hah! Hmm, just my
imagination, I guess.

127
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,100
AUGGGGGHHHH!

128
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,340
Ch-ch-ch-changeling!!

129
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,380
No, wait! Come back!

130
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,840
AAAAHHHHHH!

131
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,100
AAAAHHHHHH!

132
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,830
This is unexpected.

133
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,580
The ice is pretty slippery.

134
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,760
I wouldn't want you to
get hurt because of me.

135
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,980
You... saved me?

136
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,120
It's OK. I know you
don't want to be friends.

137
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,920
Wait!

138
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,880
I don't understand. Changelings
are supposed to be evil, right?

139
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,360
Evil? Oh, not me. All I've
ever wanted is a friend.

140
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,700
From the moment I first split
my egg in the nursery hive.

141
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,340
I was part of the
attack on Canterlot

142
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,500
during the Royal Wedding.

143
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,017
But I'd never seen true
friendship like that,

144
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,800
and I couldn't just steal
it and feed on its love.

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,580
I wanted to share it!

146
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,420
After that, I knew I couldn't
live with my kind anymore.

147
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,320
I set off looking for
love to share. But--

148
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,940
But what?

149
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,920
I'm starving!

150
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,380
And there's so much love in
the Crystal Empire right now.

151
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,760
It's what drew me here,
but it's driving me crazy!

152
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,840
That would be from
the Royal Crystalling.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,100
It's pretty much a giant
outpouring of light and love

154
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,800
for a new baby.

155
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,210
Oh, sorry.
I'm just so hungry.

156
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
If I had a friend, maybe the
love we shared could sustain me,

157
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,540
but I don't think the Crystal
Ponies want to be friends.

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,040
What if I told you there was
somepony they respect and admire

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,040
so much, he could convince
them to give it a try?

160
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,780
If only that were true!

161
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,640
It is! I mean, I
am. It's ME! Spike!

162
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,760
Spike? The Brave and Glorious?
I'm sure you've heard of me.

163
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,860
No, but I was raised by
an evil queen. I'm Thorax.

164
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,540
I can't believe you
want to help me.

165
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,240
Why? Hasn't anypony ever
just been nice to you?

166
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,740
Sorry! Sorry! Kindness
like that kind of brings it out.

167
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,220
Do you still want
to be my friend?

168
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,070
Of course! And I am one
hundred percent sure

169
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,740
I can get the whole Crystal
Empire to be your friend too.

170
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,180
But, maybe I should just uh,
talk to them first.

171
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,480
What do you mean? Did
you see the Changeling?

172
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,400
Did you defeat
the evil creature?

173
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,960
Defeating a Changeling
would be brave,

174
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,260
but do you know what
would be glorious?

175
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,220
Defeating two Changelings?

176
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
Defeating all the Changelings?

177
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,230
Not having to fight
the Changeling at all

178
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
because I made
friends with him.

179
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:42,020
Ha hah! Oh. Wow. For a second
I thought you were serious!

180
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:47,145
Ha ha! Could you imagine?
Friends with a Changeling?

181
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,080
I am serious. He
wants to be friends.

182
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,260
Ha ha ha! Right!

183
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,750
Not only are you Spike
the Brave and Glorious,

184
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,890
you're also Spike
the Hilarious! Ha ha!

185
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,820
I'm not joking. The
Changeling is nice.

186
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,760
HA HA HA!

187
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,520
I'm sorry. But I don't
think it's funny.

188
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,600
The Changeling Queen,
Chrysalis, kidnapped Cadance

189
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,030
and cast a spell on me.

190
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,660
There's no such thing
as a nice Changeling.

191
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,440
You're right, Shining Armor.
Sorry. That was a... bad joke.

192
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,100
So? So! What did they say? How
many new friends do I have?

193
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Well... it didn't go
exactly the way I thought.

194
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:43,168
Uh, I understand. Well,
thanks for trying.

195
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
I-I guess it's not surprising.

196
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,700
How can you expect ponies
who look like this.

197
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,080
To trust something
that looks like this?

198
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,880
I think I might know.

199
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,220
Spike, if you're done
searching for the Changeling,

200
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,800
Starlight and I
could use your help.

201
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,360
We're working on a protection
spell for Flurry Heart

202
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,540
and nopony takes
notes like you.

203
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,860
Uh actually, Twilight,

204
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,660
I wanted to introduce
you to my friend, um...

205
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,940
...Crystal! ...Hoof!

206
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,720
Crystal Hoof, my good
friend, Crystal Hoof.

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,780
Nice to meet you.

208
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,600
Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you
too. How do you know Spike?

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,750
Oh, Spike and I go way back--

210
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,080
--to the Equestria Games.

211
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,720
That's when we met. We've
been pen pals ever since.

212
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,830
Pen pals! Spike, you could have
been using my pen pal quill set!

213
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,460
Why didn't you tell me?

214
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Well, I-I pretty much
only write to him

215
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,780
when you and Starlight
are studying.

216
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,200
I like to brag to all my
friends about my letters

217
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,460
from Spike the
Brave and Glorious.

218
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,200
Well, I'm sure Starlight
and I can manage,

219
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,040
if you want to spend
time with your friend.

220
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,260
Great! Crystal Hoof promised
to take me around the city.

221
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,450
Ha! That was amazing!

222
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,920
I told ya.

223
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,920
Crystal Hoof is nearly as
entertaining as Spike himself!

224
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,660
Ah! This place is everything
I've ever dreamed of.

225
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,800
But I can't keep
pretending

226
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,340
to be a Crystal
Pony forever, can I?

227
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,820
Relax, you're winning them over.

228
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,260
Pretty soon, nopony will care
that you're a Changeling.

229
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,800
<i>Spike!</i>

230
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,040
Twilight told me you
were off with a friend.

231
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,300
And any friend of Spike
the Brave and Glorious

232
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,460
is a friend of mine.

233
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,720
Oh she's so beautiful!

234
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:34,230
There's so much LOVE
around her. I-- I--

235
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:43,460
I, I'm so sorry!
I can't-can't stop.

236
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,760
Spike, get away
from the Changeling!

237
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,840
Wait! No! You
don't understand.

238
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,550
This Changeling replaced your
friend to get close to the baby.

239
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,400
What other explanation
could there be?

240
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,140
I don't know.

241
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,471
After it! Don't let
the Changeling escape!

242
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,400
I hope your friend is OK.

243
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah... me too.

244
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,180
Spike, you should
go find Crystal Hoof

245
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,480
while we hunt down
the Changeling.

246
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm pretty sure he
doesn't want to see me.

247
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,860
Spread out! The Changeling
is probably still nearby.

248
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,820
Actually, I'm
pretty sure he ran

249
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,900
as far away from
here as possible.

250
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,220
But I bet I know where!

251
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,560
Thorax? Hello?

252
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,260
I just want to apologize. I
should have stood up for you.

253
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,180
Aw, come on, Thorax.
I know you're in here.

254
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:59,390
Leave me alone!

255
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,120
Um... little help?

256
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,840
Why do you think I would help
you? I'm an evil Changeling!

257
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,760
Because you're my friend.

258
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,900
I just wish I had
been one to you.

259
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,380
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

260
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,520
It's OK. I know it's hard.

261
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,600
Everyone in the Crystal
Empire loves you.

262
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,020
I couldn't ask you to
give that up for me.

263
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,840
You don't have to ask.

264
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,360
What are you going to do?

265
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,540
What I should have done
in the first place.

266
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,120
Let's move, move, move, move.

267
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,480
Have you checked there?
Look around that corner.

268
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,760
I know it's bad that
there's a Changeling around,

269
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,400
but is all this
really necessary?

270
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,160
If there's one Changeling,

271
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,380
there may well be a
whole army on the way.

272
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,860
True, but Starlight
has a point.

273
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,620
This is getting a
little out of hand.

274
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,750
I understand, but I don't
know what else we can do.

275
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,680
I do!

276
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,580
Spike! What are you doing?
Get away from that thing!

277
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,940
No. He's not a thing. His name
is Thorax. And he's my friend.

Spike, I'm so
proud of you.

302
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,500
You are? 

303
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,920
Of course! You're a celebrity
here in the Crystal Empire

304
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,140
and you just risked
all of it for a friend.

305
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,120
I can't imagine anything
more brave than that.

306
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,820
As the Princess of Friendship,

307
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,640
I try to set an example
for all of Equestria.

308
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,550
But today, it was Spike who
taught me that a new friend

309
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,420
can come from anywhere.
I guess everypony

310
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,420
still has things to learn
about friendship, even me.

311
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,460
And if Spike says Thorax is his
friend, then he's my friend too.

312
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,460
Thank you.

313
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,020
On behalf of the Crystal Empire,
I would like to extend my hoof

314
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,000
in friendship and I am
sure all of my subjects

315
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
are eager to do the same.

316
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,280
Welcome to the Crystal
Empire, Thorax.

317
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,900
I'm sorry we didn't take the
time to get to know you.

318
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,020
Maybe we can change that now.

319
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,480
That'd be so amazing! I want
to know all about friendship.

320
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,990
And maybe one day I can
take that knowledge back

321
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,260
to the Changeling Kingdom.

322
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,820
If my kind learned how to
create love for one another,

323
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
maybe they wouldn't have
to take it from others!

324
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,560
To Spike the Brave and Glorious!

325
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,880
Looks like you were
right after all.

326
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,960
Right about what?

327
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,960
Friendship lessons
can happen anywhere.
