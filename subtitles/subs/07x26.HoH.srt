making a lot of apologies today.

426
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,620
    I simply cannot believe
    how tall you've gotten!

427
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:26,157
       Well, it has been
     over a thousand years.

428
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,893
     Will you stay here and
    teach magic once again?

429
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,563
 My sister and I have such fond
   memories of your lessons.

430
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,266
  As long as you don't ask for
    those essays we owed you

431
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,834
before you disappeared.

433
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,738
   I am not certain Canterlot
    is where I belong.

434
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,508
   The realm has grown and I
believe I'll have a look around

435
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,777
        before I settle
       in any one place.

436
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,948
And I long to see what
has become of my home.

437
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,417
      I believe we all do.

438
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,454
 Then I hope you will return to
  Canterlot on occasion

439
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,123
    and share the wisdom of
     your great experience

440
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,626
      with the next
     generation of ponies.

441
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,695
  We would be honored, but
   if it is wisdom you seek,

442
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,131
        look no further
      than your own pupil.

443
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,700
     She showed me that the
      power of friendship

444
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,070
   is a magical force indeed.

445
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,105
      And that in turning
       away from others,

446
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,074
   you hurt yourself as well.

     It's funny. I thought
      meeting my idol

449
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,148
     would give me all the
     answers I ever wanted.

450
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,018
     But instead, I forgot
      what I already knew.

451
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,254
   Good thing I had a student
    of my own to remind me.
