1
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:47,852
Applejack, you're sure to knock everypony's
hat off at the Equestria Rodeo competition!

2
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:50,965
Aw shucks, Apple Bloom.
I sure hope so.

3
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,356
Hope so?
I know so!

4
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:57,546
After all, you're the ten-time
rodeo champion of Ponyville!

5
00:00:57,547 --> 00:01:02,196
Why, you got more blue ribbons
than anypony in Ponyville ever!

6
00:01:02,197 --> 00:01:06,430
And I can't wait for my big sis' to
win every blue ribbon in Equestria...

7
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:11,809
...and bring home the title of
Equestria Rodeo Champion.

9
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:58,406
Now, careful, Derpy!

10
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:01,622
Don't want to do any more damage
than you've already done...

11
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:07,481
I just don't know what went wrong.

12
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,572
Yeah. It's a mystery.

13
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:15,928
Nice work, Rainbow Dash.

14
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:30,267
You okay, Rainbow Dash?
Anything I can do to help?

15
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,102
No! Nothing!

16
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:36,824
In the name of Celestia,
just sit there and do nothing.

17
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:42,591
Oops. My bad.

18
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:47,766
Applejack!
Applejack!

19
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,706
Everypony, can I get your attention?

20
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:52,206
Attention please!

21
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:55,716
Yes, we are all here to send
Applejack to compete...

22
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,447
...in this year's Equestria Rodeo
competition in Canterlot.

23
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:08,138
And, I want to thank Applejack in advance...

24
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:12,913
...for generously offering up
her prize money to fix town hall.

25
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:16,571
Yeah, Applejack!
Whoohoo!

26
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:24,201
Speech!
Speech!

27
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:27,320
Oh, shucks.
I'm not much for speeches.

28
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,377
Alright then, no speech!

29
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:35,359
But, this is the nicest send off
anypony could ask for.

30
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,619
Y'all have been cheering me on in every
rodeo since I was a little little pony.

31
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,247
So it seems only fittin' to use
my winnings to fix up town hall.

32
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:48,339
I promise to make Ponyville proud.

33
00:03:55,307 --> 00:04:02,584
I want you to show all them high-falutin'
rodeo ponies what a real rodeo pony's like!

34
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:04,279
You betcha, Granny Smith.

35
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,830
And bring back all that money!

36
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,524
You betcha, Mayor.

37
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,576
And have fun.
And don't be nervous.

38
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:14,637
Or barf. Use that nervous energy to do
even better than you already would!

39
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:18,091
And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy
and taffy gives lots of nervous energy!

40
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,263
- Just do your best, Applejack.
- I'll do better than my best!

41
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,516
The train to Canterlot is about to leave!

42
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,075
All aboard who's coming aboard!

43
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:30,730
Guess that means me.

44
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:32,231
See ya in a week!

45
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:33,932
With lots of new blue ribbons!

46
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,933
And lots of money!

47
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,434
Darn tootin'!

48
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:48,649
See y'all in a week, with a
big bag full of blue ribbons!

49
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:52,455
And drink sarsaparilla!

50
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:55,519
What? It gives you extra sass.

51
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,153
I hope Applejack is surprised
by this surprise party!

52
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:06,328
Well, that is the point.

53
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:10,080
I know, but I hope she isn't
so surprised she's startled.

54
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,781
Because while being surprised can be nice...

55
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:14,910
...being startled can be very startling.

56
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,411
Surprise!

57
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:19,735
Oh, Pinkie, you startled me.

58
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,641
Sorry! I was just practicing my "surprise!"
for when we surprise Applejack...

59
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:27,949
...with this super cool party for becoming
rodeo champion of Equestria! Surprise!

60
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,765
Quiet, Pinkie.
I think Applejack's coming!

61
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,408
Don't worry, Twilight.
Got my lips all limbered up!

62
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:51,219
SURPRISE!

63
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,203
Surprise!

64
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:53,504
Shoot!

65
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,824
Wow, this is the best surprise ever!

66
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:58,825
How did you know it was my birthday?

67
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:10,020
Who's it from, Twilight?
What's it say?

68
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:11,421
It's from Applejack.

69
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:14,676
"Family and friends, not
coming back to Ponyville."

70
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:16,964
"Don't worry, will send money soon."

71
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:19,058
That's all there is.

72
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:24,139
Applejack's... not comin' back?

73
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,189
What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?!

74
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,931
She loves Ponyville!

75
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:31,710
And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!

76
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,435
And she loves her family!

77
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:39,389
Something just dreadful must have happened
to Applejack to make her not return!

78
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,514
Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!

79
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:46,170
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's go find her!

80
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:49,485
Don't worry. We'll search all of
Equestria if we have to.

81
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:50,965
We'll bring her back.

82
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,466
Y'all are the best.

83
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,067
Thank you, girls!

84
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:02,887
Our little bushel just lost one apple.

85
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:09,782
I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end.

86
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:13,090
I don't wanna go home empty-hooved
after promising we'd find her.

87
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,826
I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.

88
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,884
I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!

89
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:20,565
I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!

90
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:25,173
This is Dodge Junction, girls.

91
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:28,278
Applejack is supposed to have
come here after the rodeo ended.

92
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,976
Let's fan out and try to find her.

93
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:35,577
Pickles!

94
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:37,966
Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry!

95
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,467
Hurry it up in there!

96
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:43,022
Some ponies. Sheesh.

97
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,159
Applejack!

98
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,385
I found her, I found her, I found her,
I found her, I found her!

99
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,760
Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!

100
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:56,361
We're so glad you're safe!

101
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:58,951
I found her, I found her,
I found her, I found her!

102
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,686
Be right back.

103
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,842
Uh, hey, everypony.

104
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:06,243
What's up?

105
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,144
Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!

106
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:10,309
Yes, why are you here?

107
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,710
Are you okay?

108
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,011
Do you have any snacks?

109
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,912
Tell us what happened, Applejack!

110
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:19,469
Applejack? Are these some
of your Ponyville friends?

111
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,570
Yes ma'am.

112
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,071
And you are...?

113
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:25,849
Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee,
boss at Cherry-o Range.

114
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,750
Hasn't Applejack told ya?

115
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:30,822
I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo.

116
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:35,221
Never saw anypony win so
many ribbons in all my life.

117
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:38,631
Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee.
You don't have to go into all that.

118
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:40,432
Oh, she's so modest.

119
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:44,652
Anyway, I can always use a pony with
quick hooves and a strong back.

120
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:47,716
So, when I heard Applejack was
looking for a change of scenery...

121
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:51,600
...I snapped her up as quick as I could
and brought her to Dodge Junction.

122
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,106
Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends.

123
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:55,707
See you back at the ranch.

124
00:09:56,545 --> 00:10:00,032
"Change of scenery"?
What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,374
No big deal, guys.

126
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,762
I thought cherries would be
a nice change from apples...

127
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:07,059
...so I took the job and came here.
That's it. End of story.

128
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,040
That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!

129
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,957
Sorry, but that's all there is to tell.

130
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,084
Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now.

131
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:18,100
Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing okay.

132
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:23,205
Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel
all over Equestria searching for you...

133
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,706
...to come home without you!

134
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,217
Well I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me!

135
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:31,034
There is nothin' to tell and I am
not going back to Ponyville!

136
00:10:31,635 --> 00:10:35,433
I don't care what she says,
Applejack's not telling us something.

137
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,454
Twilight's right. We gotta
get her to spill the beans!

138
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,615
What?! She had beans?

139
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:43,415
I told her I was snacky!

140
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,807
You ready to put your back into it, Applejack?

141
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,308
Sure am, Miss Jubilee.

142
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,449
Terrific. Come on in, girls!

143
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,366
What are you all doing here?

144
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:57,967
We're your cherry sorters.

145
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,857
- Shall we get started?
- Fine!

146
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:04,093
Red cherries go in one bin and
yellow cherries go in the other.

147
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,794
Simple as cherry pie.

148
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:10,252
Just one teensy thing to remember – have fun!

149
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,057
What are you five up to?

150
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:18,672
You made working on a cherry
orchard sound... so delightful.

151
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:23,600
Well, just remember :
no talking about Ponyville.

152
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:24,601
Fine!

153
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,823
Why don't you quit talking and get walking?

154
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:53,330
So, AJ... how was Canterlot?

155
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:57,287
Not talking about Ponyville,
talking about Canterlot...

156
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:58,488
...totally different town.

157
00:11:58,489 --> 00:11:59,989
Canterlot was fine.

158
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,490
Was the rodeo fun?

159
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:02,491
Yes.

160
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,213
Did you meet some nice ponies there?

161
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:06,414
Some.

162
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:09,318
Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok?

163
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:10,925
What about Calamity Mane?

164
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,300
Yes, saw 'em both.

165
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:20,004
And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?

166
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:23,204
Well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo.

167
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:24,254
Real good treats.

168
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:28,084
Um, excuse me?

169
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,834
Cherry links, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts.

170
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,514
We struck up a conversation
being orchard folk and all.

171
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:35,674
So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?

172
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:36,294
Yes.

173
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:38,594
Did you tell her why you weren't going back?

174
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:40,834
No, 'cuz it was none of her business!

175
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:44,624
Can you please slow down?

176
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:47,644
Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?

177
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:48,374
No!

178
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,454
Is it because you were insulted when...

179
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:01,484
...I gave you that book on organized orchards?

180
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:02,444
No!

181
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,664
Is it because you were insulted
when I insulted your hair?

182
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,194
No, no, NO!

183
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:13,844
I'm not telling you why, so just...

184
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:14,934
Stop!

185
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:32,019
Well, girls, we seem to be striking out.

186
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,455
That's 'cause we're playing too nice.

187
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:38,121
Yes. Desperate times do call
for desperate measures.

188
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:41,118
It's time to call in the big guns.

189
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:56,690
Hey Applejack.
Need some help?

190
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:59,087
You promise not to ask me any questions?

191
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,344
I promise.

192
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,927
Have you ever had a cherry chonga?

193
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:10,928
Oh! Sorry, that was a question.

194
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:12,829
That kind of question is fine, Pinkie.

195
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,182
No, I never had a cherry chonga.

196
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:17,852
Well no wonder, because I made it up myself!

197
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,935
A cherry chonga is mashed up
cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried.

198
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:23,097
Cherry chonga. Great name, huh?

199
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:24,603
Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimmy cherry.

200
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:27,080
Oh, that's good too. Which
do you think sounds better?

201
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:28,381
Cherry chonga or chimmy cherry?

202
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,382
Or what if I combine them?
Chimmy cherry chonga!

203
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:33,853
What sounds the funniest?
I like funny words!

204
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:35,751
One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'!

205
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:36,924
I didn't make that one up.

206
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:40,332
I would work in a kumquat orchard
just so I could say 'kumquat' all day!

207
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,586
Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat!

208
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:46,781
And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that
just the funnest thing to say?

209
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,282
Pickle barrel pickle barrel pickle barrel.

210
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:49,783
Say it with me!

211
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:53,285
Pickle barrel kumquat, pickle barrel kumquat,
pickle barrel kumquat, chimmy cherry chonga!

212
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:55,956
No! Make it stop, make it stop!

213
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:59,582
The only way to make it stop
is for you to spill the beans.

214
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,383
Never!

215
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:04,780
Speaking of beans, did you ever realize
how many words rhyme with 'beans'?

216
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:08,734
- Lean, mean, spleen, I'm queen, bean...
- Alright, alright!

217
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,618
I'll tell everypony what's goin' on!

218
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,019
Just please stop talkin'!

219
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,613
But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at
breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out.

220
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:20,967
Tomorrow, huh?
I don't know...

221
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:22,579
Do you Pinkie promise?

222
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:28,748
I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast.

223
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:30,349
Pinkie promise.

224
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,916
I'm glad we're finally gonna get
some answers from Applejack.

225
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,666
Yeah, maybe.

226
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:48,273
Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta
'fess up after making a Pinkie promise.

227
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,772
Good morning, Applejack. You ready for...

228
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:01,373
Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!

229
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:08,676
Applejack!

230
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:11,509
You Pinkie promised!

231
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,469
Applejack, come back here!

232
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,594
Giddy up, fellas, I gotta
get the heck out of Dodge!

233
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,651
She's gonna get away!

234
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,110
Oh no, she won't!
Look, girls!

235
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:28,707
Follow that stagecoach!

236
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:40,852
We have you now!

237
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:03,821
What the hay?

238
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,551
Pull over!

239
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,544
Hey! Cut that out!

240
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:12,432
I'll pay you double to outrun them.

241
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,717
We'll pay you triple to slow down!

242
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:21,071
I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!

243
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,113
That was rude!

244
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,673
Get them!
Get them!

245
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:31,819
Come on, Fluttershy!

246
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,204
C'mon, y'all!
Go, go!

247
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:49,060
Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!

248
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:51,145
Pinkie, I did not break my promise!

249
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:52,146
Wha?

250
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:56,985
If y'all reckon back, I told you that I'd
tell you everything at breakfast.

251
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:58,413
But I didn't come to breakfast.

252
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:02,648
I couldn't come to that breakfast, not
if it meant telling y'all what happened.

253
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,249
Well, I... I...

254
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,666
I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell
y'all the truth. I just can't.

255
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,755
Well I heard a sorry in there,
so that'll have to do for now.

256
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:14,077
I'll get a real apology later.
Rarity, catch me.

257
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:15,678
What? Pinkie!

258
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,580
Rainbow, go back!

259
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,421
No time! They knew what
they were getting into!

260
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,466
Lady, you're trouble.

261
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:02,231
Try and catch me now.

262
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:05,474
Oh, nuts.

263
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:15,618
Not so fast!

264
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,793
Fine. Now you know.

265
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:26,156
Know what?

266
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,504
Well, just look!

267
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:34,553
I am. You won an amazing number of
ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!

268
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:37,969
Don't you get it? There's every
color of ribbon down there.

269
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,887
Every color... but... blue.

270
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:46,690
I came in fourth, third, even second.

271
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:51,861
But I didn't win one first prize... and I
certainly didn't win any prize money.

272
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:54,688
But the telegram said you were gonna send money.

273
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:58,228
That's why I came here.
I wanted to earn some money.

274
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:01,000
After that big old send off Ponyville gave me...

275
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,843
...I just didn't have the nerve
to come home empty-hooved.

276
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:06,009
I couldn't come home a failure.

277
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,606
Applejack, you're not a failure.

278
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:11,107
And we're your friends!

279
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,111
We don't care if you came in fiftieth place!

280
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,593
You're still number one in our books.

281
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:20,135
So... you're not upset, or disappointed?

282
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,841
But what about the mayor?

283
00:20:23,842 --> 00:20:27,954
I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't
get that money to fix the broken roof.

284
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:32,473
Applejack, we can always find a
way to fix that hole in the roof.

285
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:37,775
But if you don't come back, we'll never
be able to fix the hole in our hearts.

286
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:45,523
Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!

287
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,399
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

288
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,343
"...it's a tad easier to be proud when you come
in first than it is when you finish further back."

289
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:59,129
"But there's no reason to hide when
you don't do as well as you'd hoped."

290
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,635
"You can't run away from your problems."

291
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:06,200
"Better to run to your friends and family."

292
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:13,312
What did you think, Rarity?

293
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,480
Chimmy cherry, or cherry chonga?
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?

294
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:20,970
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?
Chimmy cherry, cherry chonga?

295
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,540
When I get back, you're
gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!
