1
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:13,515
We're getting closer.

2
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,319
I can hardly wait!

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,754
I'm so excited I...
I feel like shouting.

4
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:20,719
Woohoo.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,101
Whoo wee! Canterlot, here we come!

6
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:27,165
Oh, I do hope I look festive enough.

7
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:30,067
There it is! Canterlot!

8
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:32,612
Ooh!

9
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,241
Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful
this time of year?

10
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,927
Yeah. I wish it was Hearth's
Warming Eve every day.

11
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,246
There's so much to look at here.

12
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:47,157
I feel like my durn eyes are gonna
pop right outta my head.

13
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:48,190
I have an idea.

14
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:51,810
Let's play "I spy with my little eye"
as we walk. I'll go first.

15
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,435
I spy...

16
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,559
...an eight foot candy cane.

17
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,275
I spy a snowpony.

18
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:01,929
I spy somepony eating
a gingerbread house.

19
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:05,883
And it's me!

20
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:00,988
I can't believe that
Princess Celestia chose us...

21
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:03,466
...to put on the most
important play of the season.

22
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:07,124
Do you guys know what
an honor this is? For all of us?

23
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,007
Oh. I wish she hadn't
honored me quite so much.

24
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,048
I can't go on stage. I don't want
everypony looking at me!

25
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,676
Fluttershy, darling, there is
nothing to feel nervous about.

26
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:18,342
No?

27
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:23,136
Of course not. All across
Equestria ponies are preparing...

28
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:26,421
...their own pageants for Hearth's
Warming Eve in their own towns.

29
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:27,601
It's tradition.

30
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:30,768
So you're saying they'll be
too busy to come to our play?

31
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,733
Well, no. We're in
the Canterlot pageant...

32
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:36,705
...the biggest, most important
production in all of Equestria.

33
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,354
A lot of ponies will come to watch us.

34
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:40,481
A lot?

35
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,679
Hundreds.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,930
Hundreds?

37
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,873
Maybe even thousands!

38
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:51,154
Oh! My hair!

39
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:54,815
Applejack, be a dear and
shut those windows, will you?

40
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,554
Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!

41
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:02,081
Thank you! Thank you!

42
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,892
It's a reenactment
of the founding of Equestria.

43
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,171
It's not "The Rainbow Dash Show".

44
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:11,071
Well, it should be "The Rainbow
Dash Show". I'm the star.

45
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:14,204
Fluttershy! You've got to
come out of there!

46
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:15,701
Curtain in two minutes.

47
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:17,885
Twilight, let me handle this.

48
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:18,773
My hair!

49
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:21,434
PIIINKIEEE...

50
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,638
The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant
is about harmony and friendship...

51
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,874
SHUT THE WINDOW!

52
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:39,868
Once upon a time, long before
the peaceful rule of Celestia...

53
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:43,075
...and before ponies discovered
our beautiful land of Equestria...

54
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,916
...ponies did not know harmony.

55
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,614
It was a strange and dark time...

56
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,765
...a time when ponies
were torn apart...

57
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:51,947
...by hatred.

58
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:55,907
I know. Can you believe it?

59
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:58,966
During this frightful age
each of the three tribes...

60
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:01,970
...the pegasi, the unicorns
and the earth ponies...

61
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:07,522
...cared not for what befell the other
tribes, but only for their own welfare.

62
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:10,038
In those troubled times, as now...

63
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,526
...the pegasi were
the stewards of the weather...

64
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:15,792
...but they demanded
something in return...

65
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:19,585
...food that could only
be grown by the earth ponies.

66
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,453
The unicorns demanded the same...

67
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:33,816
...in return for magically
bringing forth day and night.

68
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,261
And so mistrust between
the tribes festered...

69
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:41,002
...until one fateful day
it came to a boil.

70
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:43,414
And what prompted the ponies to clash?

71
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:47,572
'Twas a mysterious blizzard,
that overtook the land...

72
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:51,195
...and toppled the tribes'
precarious peace.

73
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:56,624
The normally industrious earth ponies
were unable to farm their land.

74
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:06,170
The earth ponies were freezing.

75
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,002
Home of the pegasi fared no better.

76
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:12,910
The pegasi were hungry.

77
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:18,419
And the unicorns were
freezing *and* hungry.

78
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:23,458
Even the unicorns' magic was
powerless against the storm.

79
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:30,370
Each tribe blamed the others
for their suffering...

80
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,526
...and the angrier everypony grew,
the worse the blizzard became.

81
00:05:36,313 --> 00:05:39,831
And so it was decided, that
a grand summit will be held...

82
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:42,491
...to figure out a way
to cope with the blizzard.

83
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:44,892
Each tribe sent their leaders.

84
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:49,328
Daughter of the unicorn
king: Princess Platinum.

85
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:55,228
Ruler of the pegasi:
Commander Hurricane.

86
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,679
And lastly leader of the earth
ponies: Chancellor Puddinghead.

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,393
Perhaps the three tribes could
finally settle their differences...

88
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:08,059
...and agree on a way
to get through this disaster.

89
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:17,038
All I wanna know is why the earth
ponies are hogging all the food.

90
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:21,845
US?! We're not hogging
all the food. You are!

91
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,628
Oh, wait. You're right. It's us.

92
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:27,856
Well, it's only cause you mean old
pegasuseseses are making it snow like crazy!

93
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:30,709
For the hundredth time, it's not us!

94
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,347
We're not making it snow.

95
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,428
It must be the unicorns!

96
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,622
They're doing it with
their freaky magic.

97
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:38,952
How dare you?!

98
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:43,686
Unlike you pegasi ruffians, we unicorns
would never stoop to such a thing.

99
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,887
Ha-Me-Ph.

100
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:45,855
Hmph.

101
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:49,200
Well, if you non-earths aren't gonna
stop using your weirdo powers...

102
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,563
...to freeze us all, then
I'm just plum out of ideas.

103
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:56,190
What a shocker!
An earth pony with no ideas.

104
00:06:56,191 --> 00:07:00,231
Commander Hurricane!
Please cease with the insults!

105
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,936
You're not the boss of me,
your royal snootiness!

106
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:04,706
I BEG YOUR PARDON!

107
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,831
I am a princess!
I won't be spoken to that way!

108
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,880
Well, I'm leaving first!

109
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:11,831
No, I'm first!

110
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:19,041
And the blizzard raged on.

111
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:26,854
So the summit of the tribes did not
turn out as well as hoped...

112
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:30,184
...and the three leaders returned
home to lick their wounds...

113
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,105
...and basically complain.

114
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:39,357
ATTEN-TION!

115
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:44,325
Well? Aren't you curious
about how it went?

116
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:47,703
Oh! Uh... Commander Hurricane, sir!
How did it go, sir?

117
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:51,206
Horribly! Those other tribe
leaders are so disrespectful.

118
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:53,909
Don't they realize that we are
a mighty tribe of warriors...

119
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,294
...and should not be crossed?

120
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,971
We have got to break ranks
with those weak foals.

121
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,248
Clover the Clever! I need you!

122
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,972
Yes, your majesty.

123
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:09,579
Did the other pony tribes
see reason as I predicted?

124
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,926
Those other tribes are impossible.

125
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:16,641
I, for one, can no longer bear to be
anywhere near the lowly creatures.

126
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:19,152
The unicorns are noble and majestic.

127
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:22,293
We will no longer consort
with the likes of them.

128
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:32,454
Wouldn't it have been easier
to use the door, Chancellor?

129
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:36,352
Maybe for you, Smart Cookie.
But I am a chancellor.

130
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:39,010
I was elected, because I know
how to think outside the box.

131
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,049
Which means...

132
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:43,498
...I can also think inside the chimney.

133
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,390
Can you think inside the chimney?

134
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,337
-I...
-I didn't think so.

135
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,439
Oh my gosh. Hold on to your hooves...

136
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,587
I am just about to be brilliant!

137
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:58,766
That'd be a first.

138
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:02,641
I have decided that the earth
ponies are gonna go it alone.

139
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,381
Aw, so you mean the other
tribes didn't come around?

140
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:08,010
Shoot. I really thought we could
get through to them if we...

141
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,250
Don't worry about them.

142
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:12,123
We're the ones with
all the food, right?

143
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,423
Uh, actually we're all out.

144
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:18,519
Fine. Then we'll have to go somewhere
near where we can grow some new food.

145
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,410
And with me as our fearless
leader, what could go wrong?

146
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,214
Where should I start?

147
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:27,355
The point is...

148
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:30,640
We must find a new land!

149
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:36,892
Come on, Private Pansy.
Let's get a move on.

150
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:38,479
Hup one, hup two...

151
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:42,402
Get a hold of yourself, private!

152
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:45,304
We cannot let anything distract us
from the mission at hand.

153
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:49,422
To find (and if necessary
to conquer) a new land.

154
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:51,556
Conquer, sir?

155
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,319
Never know where enemies
might be lurking.

156
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,389
I don't see any enemies, commander.

157
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,332
Just snow.

158
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,427
Aha! Who's that?

159
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:08,257
Okay, this is getting old.

160
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,540
Mm, this is simply taking forever.

161
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,707
My hooves are killing me.
How long have we been walking for?

162
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,791
About five minutes, Your Highness.

163
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:24,108
I never imagined finding
a new land would be so hard.

164
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:25,339
But it'll all be worth it.

165
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,454
Don't you agree?

166
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:29,670
I actually think that the three
tribes could have tried harder.

167
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,684
STOOOP!

168
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:34,726
-What's wrong?
-That is what's wrong.

169
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,173
Your Highness, it's just a stream.

170
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,742
We can cross it easily.

171
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,874
I refuse to get my gown wet.

172
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,819
I have no intention
of arriving at my new land...

173
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,922
...looking like
a bedraggled earth pony.

174
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:51,766
Or worse yet,
a rough-and-tumble pegasus.

175
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,380
I, for one, have no intention
of stooping down to their level.

176
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:59,743
On the other hand, I have no trouble
watching *you* stoop down.

177
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,811
And do watch the gown, darling.

178
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:06,617
It's worth more than all
of the books in your library.

179
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:13,332
Yes, yes.

180
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,858
This is definitely the right direction.

181
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,593
It feels like we're going in circles.

182
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,661
But that's impossible! Are you suggesting
that I'm reading the map wrong?

183
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,511
Absolutely not, your chancellorness.

184
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:27,448
It's just that there are
holes in the map and...

185
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:30,707
Of course! How else could I
see where I was going!?

186
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,266
Yeah, uh...

187
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,602
Or talk? I need to be able to talk.

188
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:38,063
I mean, how would we survive
if I just only shut up?

189
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,002
Heaven forbid that should happen,
your chancellorship.

190
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:44,388
It's just that the map
is also upside down.

191
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:46,530
I got a news flash for you, Cookie.

192
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,943
The earth is round.
There is no up or down.

193
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:50,727
You're right!

194
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:54,406
It's such a relief to me, that
you're in charge of this map.

195
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:55,689
Relief?!

196
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,744
You don't need relief! If anypony
needs relief around here, it's me!

197
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:02,178
I'm a chancellor! I'm a big shot.
You're just my, uh...

198
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,418
...my...

199
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:04,441
Secretary.

200
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:05,333
Whatever.

201
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:10,373
You take the map, while
I enjoy some relief.

202
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,616
Yes, chancellor Puddinghead.

203
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:18,447
And so each leader encountered
obstacles along the way.

204
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:23,595
But eventually they all arrived
in the new and wondrous land.

205
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:27,178
Nopony ever seen paradise before.

206
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:30,845
This is the new land
we've been searching for!

207
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:34,905
What a view. I can see
my future house from here.

208
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:37,271
I proclaim this new land to be...

209
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,545
Pegasopolis!

210
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,339
I've never seen such jewels.

211
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,064
This ruby is dazzling.
This whole land is dazzling!

212
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:49,033
I'm double-dazzled!

213
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:54,828
In the name of the unicorns
I hereby dub this land Unicornia.

214
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:57,951
The air! The trees!

215
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:03,742
The dirt. This dirt is the dirtiest
dirt in the whole dirt world!

216
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,096
And fertile too.
Perfect to grow on food.

217
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:10,438
In the name of the earth ponies,
I think I'm gonna call this new place...

218
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,531
Uh...

219
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:13,098
Dirtville!

220
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:14,954
How about Earth?

221
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:16,934
Earth!

222
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:20,587
Congratulations to me
for thinking of it.

223
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:25,058
We've found our new home!

224
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:32,586
I planted my flag first.

225
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:34,618
-Did not!
-Did too!

226
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:37,368
I planted mine earlier than first.

227
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:40,395
All of you riffraff
are trespassing in Unicornia.

228
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,578
The name is Pegasopolis.

229
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:44,338
-Earth!
-Pegasopolis!

230
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:45,958
Unicornia!

231
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,768
I say we fight for the land.

232
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,644
May the best pony win.

233
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,093
That's barbaric.

234
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:54,698
Clover the Clever, throw
that brute into the dungeon.

235
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:59,373
What dungeon?! Look.
Perhaps if we all calm down...

236
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:02,044
I agree. Let's all calm down.

237
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,728
I vote for calm.

238
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:07,628
I'll have you court-martialled
for insubordination, private!

239
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,223
We settle this on the battlefield.

240
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:18,500
Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!

241
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,284
Wait a minute. Where'd all this
snow come from anyway?

242
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:24,316
Oh no. Not again.

243
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,264
And so the paradise that the ponies
had found was soon lost...

244
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:40,299
...buried beneath a thick blanket
of snow and hard feelings.

245
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:43,774
Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy.

246
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:46,345
Instead of wonderful, it was wintery.

247
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:49,611
Instead of spectacular,
it was snowtacular!

248
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:52,543
-Instead of...
-We get it! Move on!

249
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:56,684
Everypony was forced to seek shelter.

250
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,010
They searched high and low...

251
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:03,602
...but the only shelter for miles
was a cold and desolate cave.

252
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,794
And, of course, the three
tribes had to share it.

253
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:11,159
And nopony was too happy about that.

254
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,864
Please, Commander Hothead...

255
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:16,007
It's Commander Hurricane!

256
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:21,941
Please, Commander, could you just
stand back and give me my royal space?

257
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:24,192
You mean like this, Your Highness?

258
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:25,394
Indeed not.

259
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:27,818
You see this invisible line?

260
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:31,947
Private, outline our territory
for everypony to see.

261
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:36,405
See this real, non-invisible line?

262
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:40,180
No unicorns or earth ponies
are allowed to cross it.

263
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:43,494
This is the sovereign
territory of Pegasopolis.

264
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,711
-Clover the Clever!
-Smart Cookie!

265
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,264
I know, I know.

266
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:57,418
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

267
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,200
Don't go around the rock. Go over it.

268
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:01,626
I'm not giving up an inch
of territory to the enemy.

269
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,734
That rock is clearly on the Unicornia's
side of the cave and it belongs to us.

270
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:08,296
Who knows? There could be jewels inside.

271
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:12,093
I claim this rock for Pegasopolis.

272
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:15,500
Unhand that rock this
instant, you scoundrel!

273
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:19,201
Oh, lookie, found my rock.
I've been looking for it everywhere.

274
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:21,924
Hey!

275
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:23,515
You invaded our territory!

276
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,722
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

277
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,858
That's the last straw!

278
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,281
Give me my rock!

279
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,799
Look, everypony! The entrance!

280
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:54,957
Great. Now there's
no way out. We're trapped.

281
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,192
You two deserve this horrible fate.

282
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:59,748
You've done nothing but argue
and fight with each other.

283
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:02,086
You've been fighting too,
"Your Highness".

284
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,436
Yeah! Worse!

285
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:06,114
I haven't been fighting
nearly as much as you!

286
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:07,525
How ridiculous!

287
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,404
A unicorn never stoops to fighting.

288
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,732
That's just cause you wimpy
unicorns know you never win.

289
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,282
Earth ponies are numbskul...!

290
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:17,070
Pegasi are brut...!

291
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,131
Unicorns are snob...!

292
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,572
What is that thing?

293
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,389
They must be... windigos.

294
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,328
Windigos?

295
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:46,585
My mentor, Star Swirl the Bearded,
taught me about them.

296
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:49,785
They're winter spirits that feed
on fighting and hatred.

297
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:53,923
The more hate the spirit feels,
the colder things become.

298
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:56,231
Then this is our fault.

299
00:17:56,423 --> 00:18:00,136
We, three tribes. We brought
this blizzard to our home...

300
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:02,754
...by fightin' and
not trustin' each other.

301
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:05,011
Now it's destroyin' this land too.

302
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:08,878
And now our bodies will
become as cold as our hearts.

303
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,892
All because we were
foolish enough to hate.

304
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,222
Well, I don't hate you.

305
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:19,501
I actually hate Commander Hurricane
a lot more than I hate you guys.

306
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,772
Actually, I don't really hate her.

307
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,809
I just really, really,
really, really, really...

308
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,128
...really, really, really,
really, really dislike her.

309
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,531
-Well, I don't hate you guys either.
-Nor do I.

310
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,144
No matter what our differences,
we're all ponies.

311
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:05,125
What was that?!

312
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:07,142
I didn't know unicorns could do that.

313
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:08,250
I didn't either.

314
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:10,381
Nothing like this has
ever happened before.

315
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,826
But I know it couldn't
have been just me.

316
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:17,155
It came from all three of us
join together in friendship.

317
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:21,389
All through the night the three ponies
kept the fire of friendship alive...

318
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,637
...by telling stories to one another
and by singing songs...

319
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:29,466
...which of course became the winter
carols that we all still sing today.

320
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:33,481
Eventually the warmth of the
fire and singing and laughing...

321
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:37,360
...reached the leaders and
their bodies began to thaw.

322
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:41,844
And it even began to melt their hearts.

323
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,184
The three leaders agreed to
share the beautiful land...

324
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:00,956
...and with it harmony,
ever afterwards...

325
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:03,948
...and together they
named their new land...

326
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:05,851
Equestria!

327
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,031
<i>The fire of friendship
lives in our hearts</i>

328
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:28,284
<i>As long as it burns,
we cannot drift apart</i>

329
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:32,435
<i>Though quarrels arise,
their numbers are few</i>

330
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:38,189
<i>Laughter and singing will see us through
(Will see us through)</i>

331
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,026
<i>We are a circle of pony friends</i>

332
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:50,751
<i>A circle of friends
we'll be to the very end</i>

333
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:59,544
We should be so honored that
Princess Celestia chose us.

334
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:03,749
She must really think we exemplify
what good friends are.

335
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:08,198
Applejack, I thought you
closed all the windows.

336
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,443
Don't blame me.

337
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:12,843
Rainbow Dash should have flown up there
and shut it. After all, she's got wings.

338
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:15,407
Why do I always have to do
all the high-up chores?

339
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,014
Why can't Twilight use
her magic for a change?

340
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:25,056
You know what? I've got it.

341
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,419
