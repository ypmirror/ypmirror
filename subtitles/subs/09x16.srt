Another question! I
wanna stay in the zone!

23

<i>That</i> wasn't a question.

34
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,991
      I'm glad you decided
        to come watch

35
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,793
        your first Trivia
       Trot, Spike!

36
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,728
      I hope the rules
      aren't too confusing.

37
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,063
       Rules? Isn't trivia
      just asking questions

38
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,031
       and answering them?

39
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,768
The Trot is a <i>little</i>
more involved than that.

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,438
Let's start with the
first category of rules:

41
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,940
Categories! Rule 1:
Each category must be

42
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,942
categorically designated
and thoroughly researched

43
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,010
in all categorical...

44
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,946
...participating
in Trivia Trot.

45
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,515
And that wraps
up rule 41.6!

46
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,151
Of course, the exception
to that, 41.6a,

47
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,752
is interesting
itself because...

48
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,353
      Oh, look we're here!

49
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,359
Oooh! I can't wait to see who
my partner's going to be!

50
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,227
You don't get to
pick your own team?

51
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,696
             Rule 20.16b, Spike!

52
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,433
  To keep things fair, the
  teams are randomly selected!

53
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,836
20.16b. How
could I forget?

54
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,871
       And, based on the
       regular attendees,

55
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,439
      I've charted every
      potential teammate's

56
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,641
    strengths and weaknesses,

57
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:57,709
     plus my percentage of
     winning with each one!

58
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,513
 Ha! I knew there'd be a chart!
 Glad I'm just watching...

59
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,515
    I don't think I could
   handle being your teammate.

60
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,850
     What if I let you down?

61
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,552
[chuckle] You could never
let me down, Spike!

62
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,020
But I'm glad you're
watching too.

63
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,789
I'm going to need all
the support I can get

64
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,491
for win number three!

65
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,066
    Well, well, well, if it
    ain't our reigning champ.

66
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,402
     Think you can win again
     this week, Twilight?

67
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,305
   Everypony here has a
  different area of expertise,

68
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,306
         so it really is
         anypony's game.

69
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,775
                    But, YES!

70
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,079
         Then you'd better hope
         you get paired with me,

71
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,781
              because I am gonna
              rule this game!

72
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,851
Sunburst: We'll just see
about that.

73
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,788
I didn't come all the way from
the Crystal Empire to lose.

74
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,591
And I hope you realize I
have the highest percentage

75
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,460
of correct answers, and I
aim to keep it that way!

76
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,394
                   Pfffft!

77
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,364
              I hope YOU realize
              not every category

78
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,166
                   is gonna be
                   "Spells So Old

80
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,837
Fluttershy: I
hope there's one

81
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,839
on fur maintenance for
adorable creatures.

82
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,208
Because I've been
<i>brushing up</i>.

83
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,142
Hee hee hee.

84
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,413
           Technically, that was
           a category last week.

85
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,581
    It won't be in
    the game tonight.

86
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:14,286
Rule 37.2c, no
back-to-back categories.

87
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,121
But I think
Fluttershy was joking.

88
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,423
    Pinkie Pie: Sure sounded
      like a joke to me!

89
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,728
        Heh heh! Woohoo!

90

   She's <i>never</i> played before!
   My chart is completely off!

97

113

133
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,584
 the only pony who could really
 threaten my winning streak is--

134

141

   we're partners! For a game!

142
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,785
   I LOVE games! And I'm super
   duper excited for THIS game

143
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,653
    because it'll be my first
   time ever playing it

144
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,056
  and I get to play it with you
  which makes it even funner!

145
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,359
       Twilight and Pinkie
       Pie forever! Ooh!

146
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,896
  We can be team Twinkie! Or...
  Team Pinklight! Sparkle Pie!

147
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:14,332
    No, no, no, no... TWIPIE!

148
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,669
Pinkie... I'm glad
you're excited,

149
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,771
but tonight's
game is special.

150
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,342
 I could be the first pony ever
 to win three consecutive Trots

151
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,578
in a row and I'm
really hoping I do..!

152
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,080
         You don't have anything
         to worry about.

153
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,416
           I'll do everything I
           can to be the bestest

154
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,418

                teammate ever!

So... still think
you can win?

156
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:44,963
 [sigh] I know I can. Pinkie might not
   be the partner I expected,

157
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,365
   but I can coach her along.

158

       good at this game.

  sure I can pick up the slack.
