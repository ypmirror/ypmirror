1
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,472
       Get--get over here!

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,645
     Tents are lookin' good.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,181
  And we made good time today.

4
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:18,150
    At this rate, we'll be at
   Winsome Falls by tomorrow!

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,619
We should do the annual big
sister little sister

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,822
camping trip every weekend!

7
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,957
     Then it wouldn't be annual.

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,558
                And if we did it
                 every weekend,

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,061
            it probably wouldn't
               be as special.

10
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:31,831
But the more we do it, the
better we get at camping!

11
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,432
Remember the first
time we came here

12
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,701
and Rarity had that
gi-normous tent?

13
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:36,835
                   I heard that!

14
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:40,806
   I've gotten much better at
     roughing it, haven't I?

15
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,344
     Yup. This time you only
     packed three suitcases!

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,448
       I know what you're
   thinking, but I promise...

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,583
                 I only brought
                 the essentials.

18
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,553
Like those light thingies?

19
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,287
           Of course!

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,956
       What is life if you
    can't make it beautiful?

21
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,697
     Mmm. These berries look
       good enough to eat.

22
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:07,800
                  DON'T!

23
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,936
  According to my book, they're
      extremely poisonous!

24
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,412
       What!?

25
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,815
            I heard something; I
            stepped on something

26
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:25,385
and I saw that
 creepy cave.

27
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:28,387
             I guess I still get
             a little bit scared out here,

28
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,422
                even after the
              last camping trip.

29
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,926
Don't worry, kid, you've
got a big sister this time!

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,233
Apple Bloom: This looks amazing!

31
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:44,269
  This is going to be the best
    big sister/little sister

32
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,771
       camping trip ever!

33
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,616
           Aaaahhhhhh!

34
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,299
   Ow! What are these things!?

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,676
Aaahh!

36
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,168
            Fly-ders!

37
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,370
    Everypony run for cover!

38
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,838
         Don't get stuck
           in their...

39
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,440
              ...web!

40
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,743
         Agh! Now what!?

41
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,244
      Follow me, everypony!

42
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,051
              Scootaloo: Agh!

43
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,652
       Not the scary cave!

44
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,593
         Where did those
    terrible bugs come from?

45
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,861
        And why did they
        destroy our camp?

46
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,230
        Fly-ders are from
       the Luna Bay Area.

47
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,532
             Never seen 'em this
              far east though.

48
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,434
              Probably attracted
                 to the food.

49
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,136
               Best wait here
             until they're gone.

50
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,704
Oh, apple rot!

51
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,707
 What are we supposed to do now?

52
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,776
    We had games to play and
 marshmallows to roast at camp!

53
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,611
     In here we got nothin'.

54
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,247
    That's not entirely true.

55
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,716
       We have each other.

56
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,317
                   That's right.

57
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,851
    And if you girls want to,

58
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,553
maybe we could tell some stories

59
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,488
        to pass the time.

60
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,256
Rainbow: You want stories?

61
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,492
   I've got a ton of stories.

62
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:50,496
   Spoiler Alert: they're all
 about me and how awesome I am.

63
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,732
       I was thinking more
     like campfire stories...

64
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,201
        But we don't even
        have a campfire.

65
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,369
    I got this!

66
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,173
            Wow. That was brave.

67
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,543
Eh, it was no biggie..

68
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,547
         We aren't gonna
       tell scary stories

69
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,383
      like our last camping
          trip, are we?

70
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,252
         It's bad enough
       just being in here.

71
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,952
     Don't worry, Scootaloo.

72
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,390
  I was gonna tell you mine and
 Apple Bloom's favorite legend!

73
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,159
     Oh! You mean Rockhoof?

74
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,293
        I love that one!

75
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,995
 He was so strong and when he...

76
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,531
      Apple Bloom! Shhh. We
      haven't heard it yet.

77
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,898
                   Oh. OK.

78
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,133
               But it's so good!

79
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:29,969
                Well, it's true.

80
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,305
 Rockhoof was known far and wide
   for his incredible strength

81
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,374
       but he didn't start
          out that way.

82
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,644
      You see, Rockhoof was
      a tiny little fella,

83
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:39,745
      the son of a farmer.

84
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:40,812
Just like us!

85
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,815
Heh heh heh...

86
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,185
     They lived in a village
      that sat at the foot

87
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,420
     of a gigantic volcano.

88
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,359
<i>And the village was protected by</i>
 <i> an elite group of Guard Ponies</i>

89
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,994
    <i> called the Mighty Helm.</i>

90
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,466
          Ha ha ha ha!

91
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,568
 <i> Young Rockhoof wanted nothing</i>
      <i> more than to be part</i>

92
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,769
     <i> of the Mighty Helm...</i>

93
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,376
         Ha ha ha ha ha!

94
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,478
      <i> ...but he was told that</i>
       <i> he was too scrawny</i>

95
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,880
      <i> and weak to protect</i>
          <i> the village.</i>

96
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,190
     <i> But Rockhoof wouldn't</i>
    <i> take "no" for an answer.</i>

97
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,931
    <i> Then one fateful day...</i>

98
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,733
      <i> The volcano erupted!</i>

99
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,404
           Eeeeeeeee!!

100
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,006
    This is my favorite part!

101
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,741
       All: What happened next!?

102
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,346
   The molten lava poured down
   the side of the volcano...

103
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,284
 <i> ... and try as they might, the</i>
<i>Mighty Helm couldn't figure out</i>

104
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,553
   <i> a way to save the village.</i>

105
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,188
     <i> They had to evacuate.</i>

106
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,090
 <i> But the village ponies didn't</i>
   <i> want to leave their homes!</i>

107
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,661
        <i> They spent their</i>
      <i> entire lives there.</i>

108
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,262
  <i> They had nowhere else to go!</i>

109
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,636
      <i> So Rockhoof decided</i>
     <i> to do something crazy.</i>

110
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,544
     <i> He thought if he could</i>
  <i> divert the flow of the lava,</i>

111
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,714
      <i> he might be able to</i>
       <i> save his village!</i>

112
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,616
  <i> He started digging a trench.</i>

113
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,318
 <i> Sweetie Belle: Wait a minute...</i>

114
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,187
         All by himself?

115
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,290
It'd be impossible for one pony
to dig a trench fast enough

116
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,625
to stop the lava!

117
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,394
I mean, even I couldn't do that!

118
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,865
       Good thing Rockhoof
         didn't believe

119
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,068
    in the word "impossible".

120
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,338
 <i> He continued to work, knowing</i>
   <i> the odds were against him</i>

121
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,440
<i>but determined to push through.</i>

122
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,712
       <i> Then... something</i>
       <i> magical happened.</i>

123
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,487
 <i> Rockhoof got visibly stronger!</i>

124
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,789
        <i> But the lava was</i>
       <i> getting closer...</i>

125
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,013
   <i> Through his extraordinary</i>
         <i> determination</i>

126
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,615
    <i> and sheer force of will,</i>

127
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,652
   <i> Rockhoof more than earned</i>
 <i> his place in the Mighty Helm.</i>

128
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,856
              Yeah!

129
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,858
Good story,
Applejack!

130
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,526
Even if it
wasn't about me.

131
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,231
I love that story, no matter
how many times I hear it.

132
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,733
Why don't we see if it's
safe to head back to camp?

133
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,169
Sweetie Belle: Uh, girls?

134
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,938
There is no camp to go back to.

135
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,351
  All our hard work is ruined.

136
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,289
There, there. Sweetie Belle.

137
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,658
Not to worry.

138
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,728
 How? Our camp was so pretty and
      this cave is sooo...

139
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,130
         ...not.

140
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,667
Oh, nononono no, not true!

141
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,302
There's beauty in everything.

142
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,305
      Even these blah rocks
       aren't really blah!

143
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:29,274
  If you look closely, you can
   see flecks of gold in them.

144
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,511
    And the way the firelight
   dances on the cave wall...

145
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:33,679
        shadow and light!

146
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,447
    Ooooh, it's so gorgeous!

147
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,520
 Sweetie Belle, have I ever told
  you about<i> my</i> favorite legend?

148
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,122
 No. I didn't know you had one.

149
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,791
     Her name was Mistmane.

150
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,093
Mistmane?

151
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,830
    Isn't she the old wrinkly
   sorceress with the flower?

152
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,834
Yes. But did you
know she used to be

153
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,538
the most beautiful
unicorn in all the land?

154
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,006
               No.

155
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,075
    So what happened to her?

156
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,947
    Well, Mistmane was a very
   promising young sorceress.

157
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,751
   <i> She was as talented as she</i>
    <i> was beautiful and kind.</i>

158
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,886
      <i> Everypony loved her</i>
         <i> and missed her</i>

159
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,188
    <i> when she was sent to the</i>
      <i> finest magic school.</i>

160
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,732
  <i> While she was gone, she was</i>
     <i> delighted to find out</i>

161
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:31,203
  <i> that her best friend, Sable</i>
  <i> Spirit, was crowned Empress.</i>

162
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,574
<i>She couldn't wait to return home</i>
 <i> once she finished her studies.</i>

163
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:39,744
 <i> But once she arrived, she was</i>
  <i> devastated by what she saw.</i>

164
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,618
What happened here?

165
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,587
           The Empress happened.

166
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,890
    She makes everypony work
  day and night on her palace.

167
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,593
   We don't have time to take
     care of anything else.

168
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,860
Well, that can't be. I know her.

169
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,098
She would never do this.

170
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,968
    <i> But there was no denying</i>
   <i> what was in front of her.</i>

171
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,878
  <i> Sable Spirit took everything</i>
       <i> that was beautiful</i>

172
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,014
    <i> away from anypony else.</i>

173
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,050
  <i> But Mistmane was sure there</i>
  <i> had to be some explanation.</i>

174
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,722
      I'd assume there was
    too, if somepony told me

175
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,524
        either one of you
        two'd gone evil.

176
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,459
Yeah, I'd never believe it.

177
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,794
            I dunno...

178
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,197
    I've seen the way you two
  get when you miss breakfast.

179
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,698
        Ha! Just kidding!

180
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,067
   But I'd want answers, too.

181
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,102
        So did Mistmane.

182
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,304
She went to confront her friend.

183
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,378
       Sable? Is that you?

184
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,782
     Don't tell me you don't
   recognize your old friend.

185
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:53,552
 I don't. My friend would never
  work our families and friends

186
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,221
    to the bone for something
      as silly as a palace.

187
00:10:56,523 --> 00:11:00,158
       Silly? My palace is
       a beacon of beauty.

188
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,263
     Anypony who passes will
    be in awe of its majesty.

189
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,766
 What good is a pretty palace if
    it just hides the misery

190
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,167
         of its ponies?

191
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,270
      Beauty is everything.

192
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,538
       You taught me that.

193
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,406
              What!?

194
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,308
                 You were always
                 the pretty one.

195
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,910
      You got to go to the
       best magic school.

196
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,745
      Everypony missed you.

197
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,481
      Everypony loved you.

198
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,550
     I admit, I was jealous.

199
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,854
  So I tried to perform a spell
  that would make me beautiful.

200
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,523
   You can see how<i> that</i> went.

201
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:36,328
      I vowed if I couldn't have
       beauty, I would take it.

202
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,030
            I wasn't chosen to
           be Empress, you know.

203
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,566
                  I took it!

204
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,736
     Just like I'm going to
      take everything else.

205
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,738
     Mistmane: I can't
     let you do that.

206
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,043
       Let me? [laughter]

207
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:25,110
                    Agh!

208
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,984
   <i> Rarity: Everypony thought</i>
   <i> Sable Spirit was defeated</i>

209

210
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,656
  <i> But Mistmane knew there was</i>
   <i> more she could do to help.</i>

211

213

216

      You did this for me?

217
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,989
   Even after I was so cruel?

218
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,458

                        Ahhh!!!!

              Ugh!

231

   These Fly-ders won't quit!

232
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,679
 What do they want from us now?

233
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,882
              Well, like it or
            not, we're food too.

234
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,118
        And I've got the
       bites to prove it!

235
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,352
    What are we going to do!?

236
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,720
      They're almost here!

237
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,361
          What?

238
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,896
Now those bugs can't get in.

239
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,600
  And<i> we</i> can't get<i> out</i> !

240
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:30,601
          Ah!

241
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,177
    Let's all just stay calm.

242
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,212
    Lemme re-light this fire.

243
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,018
We just have to wait
until the swarm moves on.

244
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,586
Then we'll think of a way out.

245
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,021
How long will
that be!?

246
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,722
Don't bears live in caves!?

247
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:54,626
           Whoa, whoa.

248
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,462
   Scootaloo, you're focusing
      on the wrong things.

249
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,629
                You have a plan!?

250
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,497
       Close.

251
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,366
I have a story!

252
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,369
                  Let me guess,
                 it's about you?

253
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:05,871
          Practically.

254
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,841
     It's about<i> my</i> favorite
      legend, Flash Magnus.

255
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,044
Wasn't he the pony who
took on the Dragons?

256
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:13,978
            Dragons!?

257
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,281
         Big, scary mean
       ones or like Spike?

258
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,451
       Oh, these were definitely
       the big scary mean kind.

259
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,424
       But not too scary.

260
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,592
       You can sit closer
       to me if you want.

261
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:34,366
   A long time ago, before the
 Wonderbolts were even founded,

262
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,503
    Flash Magnus was a lowly
   cadet in the Royal Legion.

263
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,111
    And the Legion needed to
    fly over the Dragon Lands

264
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,348
    to get to their comrades
       on the other side.

265
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,983
     But as they got closer
        to the Dragons...

266
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,187
    ... The Dragons attacked!

267
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,889
 You said this wasn't too scary!

268
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,558
   [muffled] Scootaloo, if you
      just hang in there...

269
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,325
               What?

270
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,930
         I said, if you
       just hang in there,

271
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,866
        I promise you'll
        like the ending.

272
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:11,869
  So, like I way saying, Flash
   Magnus and the Royal Legion

273
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,873
tried to get past the dragons...

274
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,607
      <i> ... but the Dragons</i>
       <i> wouldn't let them.</i>

275
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,146
       Everypony, RETREAT!

276
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,185
  <i> Flash Magnus and a few other</i>

280
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:52,744
Commander!

281
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,713
We need to save our
captured comrades.

282
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,448
             I appreciate your
          loyalty, Flash Magnus,

283
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,385
  but getting past those dragons
    is going to be impossible!

284
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,552
              Nothing will work.

285
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,989
    <i> Apple Bloom: The Commander was right.</i>

286
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,892
     You can't
out-fight Dragons.

287
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,994
   But you can out-think them.

288
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,936
Commander Ironhead, I'm pretty
sure I can out-fly the Dragons.

289
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,838
If I can lure them
into chasing me,

290
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,206
you can all sneak into the
lair and retrieve our friends

291
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,275
before they get back.

292
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,479
    Are you really willing to
   take that chance, Soldier?

293
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,547
           I am, Sir.

294
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,251
It's a very brave
thing you're doing.

295
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,153
You'll need all the
help you can get.

296
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,492
Is this... Netitus?

297
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,361
The fireproof shield?

298
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,897
     It has protected legion
     heroes for generations

299
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,800
     and today I can't think
       of a worthier flank

300
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,335
     for Netitus to protect!

301
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,771
       Good luck, soldier.

302
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,211
Phew..

303
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:03,381
      Hey! Come and get me,
    fire breath! If you can!

304
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,216
   Hey! Hey! Come and get me!

305
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,551
       Hey! I'm over here!

306
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,627
       <i> While Flash Magnus</i>
   <i> bravely flew for his life,</i>

307
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,463
  <i> Commander Ironhead was able</i>

309

    <i> Faster than the dragons!</i>

310

00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,119

312

       <i> He led the dragons</i>

   <i> One taste of the lightning</i>

   <i> Flash Magnus' plan worked!</i>

316
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:27,832
Scootaloo: Wow!

317
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,333
     I did like that ending.

318
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,435
            Told ya!

319
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:34,338
   He always inspired me to be
   my brave and awesome self.

320
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,406
                   Mmhmm!

321
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,009
          Yeah, I guess he kinda
            reminds me of you.

322
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,644
You guess?

323
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:40,711
Come on!

324
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:41,780
I'm just like him.

325
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,152
      Hey, d'you hear that?

326
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,989
     Uh.. I don't hear anything.

327
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,423
            Exactly.

328
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,725
         Those gosh darn
       fly-ders are gone!

329
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,960
         We can get out!

330
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,197
              Whoa!

331
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,633
             Or not.

332
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,902
  We're gonna have to see if we
   can get out the other way.

333
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,940
   You mean go further into
    the dark, spooky cave?

334
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,810
Scootaloo, just
remember the story.

335
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:15,079
You've gotta be brave like
me and Flash Magnus. OK?

336
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,086
I hear water!

337
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,122
              And if there's
          flowing water, then...

338
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,990
  It might lead to the way out!

339
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,192
              Ohhh!

340
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,361
          OK on three!

341
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:31,429
              One.

342
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:32,397
              Two.

343
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,831
             THREE!

344
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,104
             Woohoo!

345
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,339
              Yeah!

346
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,011
      Well, whaddaya know?

347
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,314
      We found ourselves a
   shortcut to Winsome Falls!

348
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,751
      Scootaloo: Oh.. It's never
      looked so beautiful!

349
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,719
Well, almost...

350
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,626
We sure are sorry
that our camping trip

351
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,094
wasn't what we
hoped it would be.

352
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,328
        Are you kidding?

353
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,964
      This trip is awesome!

354
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:07,832
    It is?

355
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,803
We got to hear legendary stories
     and go on an adventure.

356
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,372
  Wait, you three want to stay?

357
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,075
        Of course we do!

358
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:20,111
    We could turn those trees
   into a nice little shelter.

359
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,247
  We can get you some big logs
 and branches to help build it.

360
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,749
      And I bet we can find
       some more berries.

361
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,318
                Come on!

362
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,821
     Ooo.. I can't wait to see
     what happens next year!
