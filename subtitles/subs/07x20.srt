1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,839
   Thank you so much, Zecora!

2
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:10,042
  I never would have found the
  crisscross moss without you!

3
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,442
           <i> Of course! </i>

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,446
     <i> I know where it grows</i>
    <i> so it's not much to ask.</i>

5
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,883
    <i> Though retrieving it has</i>
     <i> been a difficult task.</i>

6
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,586
    Oh, but the oxen visiting
     Sweetfeather Sanctuary

7
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,921
      next week will surely
         appreciate it!

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,490
        It really adds a
      shine to their coat.

9
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:32,231
     <i> There we go. Now, that</i>
        <i> wasn't so tough.</i>

10
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,834
      <i> Fluttershy tell me,</i>
      <i> will this be enough?</i>

11
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:39,172
     Gee, I don't know, it's
       a pretty big pack,

12
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:41,873
       so maybe enough to
       fill up this sack?

13
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,409
        [gasp] [giggle] Oh, my!

14
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,578
         You're rubbing
       off on me, Zecora!

15
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,683
            Oh! [shouts]

16
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:56,355
      Oh, no, oh no, oh no!

17
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,891
   Zecora! Are you all right?

18
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,162
        <i> No need to fret,</i>
       <i> I only got wet...</i>

19
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,530
 <i> At least now I can easily grab</i>

20
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,266
    <i> all the crisscross moss</i>
      <i> there is to be had!</i>

21
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:18,310
      [gasp]
    What's happening to you?

22
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,313
  <i> Honestly, it's hard to tell,</i>

23
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:25,016
         <i> but suddenly I</i>
      <i> don't feel so well.</i>

24
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,465
       All right, Zecora,

25
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,068
     let's have a listen to
         the ol' ticker!

               serious, Doctor?

32
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,611
 Well, that wasn't a good sign.

33
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,746
               I can't believe a
               <i> flower</i> did this!

34
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,415
            I take back thinking
               it was pretty!

35
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,326
      We're looking for any
      color other than red.

36
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,528
                   Phew!

37
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,933
   Oh! It's just as I thought.

38
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:53,638
 I'm afraid you have a very rare
 disease called ...Swamp Fever!

39
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,377
        <i> Tell me, Doctor,</i>
        <i> what should I do?</i>

40
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,180
     <i> I've never heard of</i>
     <i> Swamp Fever, mind you.</i>

41
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,583
  Unfortunately, very little is
    known about the disease,

42
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,085
except, of course, its symptoms:

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,987
         change of coat,
        coughing bubbles,

44
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,491
    shock sneezing, confusion
      and the last stage...

45
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,260
       The afflicted turn
       into the very trees

46
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,829
     that drop the disease-
        spreading flower.

47
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,431
               Oh!

48
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,633
       <i> Is there anything</i>
       <i> that can be done?</i>

49
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,569
      <i> For such a terrible</i>
        <i> conundrum?</i>

50
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,072
A cure has yet to be discovered.

51
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,874
       I'm sorry, Zecora.

52
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,175
   Hmmm...

53
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,278
     It's a lot to take in..

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,513
                I'll leave you
                two to discuss.

55
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,817
                 Zecora, this is
                  all my fault!

56
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,052
     If you hadn't been helping
     me get the crisscross moss,

57
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,355
              you wouldn't have
             gotten Swamp Fever!

58
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,824
                   I'm so sorry.

59
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,493
        <i> Fluttershy, you</i>
       <i> are not to blame.</i>

60
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,729
      <i> These things happen,</i>
         <i> all the same.</i>

61
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,831

               Oh!

64
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,505
   <i> There's a healer of legend</i>
     <i> who never would fail.</i>

65
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,542

    <i> from ancient folk tales.</i>

66
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,578
      <i> Mystical and masked,</i>
     <i> she came in the night</i>

67

   <i> and cured everything from</i>

69
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,021

       <i> ages and ages ago.</i>

70
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,557
  The Mystical Mask, of course!

71
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,893
 My parents would tell me about
 her whenever I was sick in bed.

72
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,429
    <i> There's so many accounts</i>
      <i> of her power to heal</i>

73
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,566
  <i> She can't just be a legend.</i>
      <i> I think she's real.</i>

74
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,103
  If that's who we need to cure
you, then I'm going to find her!

75
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,571
             And I know just the
             pony who can help!

76
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:37,909
      [door opens] Twilight!

77
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,178
      [door opens] Twilight!

78
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,183
Oh, I'm so sorry
to bother--

79
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,919

80
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,389
      Yeah, Spike and I are
       having a cook-off.

81
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,423
    My cauliflower bites blew
    her sweet potato muffins

82
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,659
        out of the water!

83
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,527
                I'm glad you're
               here, Fluttershy,

84
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,197
     because we're going to need
    a second opinion about that.

85
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,202
        Um... they're both
       delicious. But ...

86
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,637
     Zecora has Swamp Fever
       and there's no cure

87
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,006
      and it's all my fault
        and the only pony

88
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,207
       who can cure her is
        the Mystical Mask

89
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,410
         and I need your
        help to find her!

90
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:10,411
Twilight: Er...

91
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:14,045
 So what'd she pick? The
cauliflower bites, right?

92
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,857
      [sigh] That's the last book
        on ancient ponies

93
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,627
     and still no mention of
       the Mystical Mask.

94
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,830
      Hmm, did we check the
      unabridged versions?

95
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,698
       Yes. And the books
        on rare diseases,

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,133
    the books on rare plants

97
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,569
     and the entire section
       on bog habitation.

98
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,105
   Well, we might have to look
       through every book

99
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,708
  in the entire library, but I
    know we'll figure it out!

100
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,043
               Oh...

101
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,521
      Oh, another dead end...

102
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,323
         Have you found
     anything yet, Twilight?

103
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,558
                [snoring]
                -Twilight?

104
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,392
           Ah! [crash]

105
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,460
Goodness, are you OK?

106
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,530
                  [sigh] I'm fine.

107
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,666
    Fluttershy, you know that
     I want to help Zecora.

108
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,669
But I think we'd be a lot better
    off if we got some sleep.

109
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,671
  We've been at this for hours.

110
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,573
        Oh, I'm so sorry!

111
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,708
      I didn't realize how
       late it had gotten!

112
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,376
           No problem.

113
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,544
          I'll grab you
         a pillow and--

114
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,180
Oh, no no no, I meant
<i> you</i> should sleep.

115
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,750
I can't rest until
Zecora is healed!

116
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,753
I understand how you feel, but I
 still think we'd have more luck

117
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,289
        if we tried again
         in the morning.

118
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,991
          Just promise me you'll
            take a break soon.

119
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:33,926
             Mm-hmm.

120
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,729
     Good night, Fluttershy.

121
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,768
      [mumbling] 9 by 13 inch pan...

122
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,603
                    Twilight!

123
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,705
      Non-stick pans!

124
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,141
    [sigh] What's all the commotion
        in here, ladies?

125
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,344
    Sorry! But I figured out
    who the Mystical Mask is.

126
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,313
         [gasp] You did?

127
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,848
       All I had to do was
         cross-reference

128
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,416
       a book about masks
        with another book

129
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,884
           on ancient
       Equestrian healers,

130
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,620
      then use a third book
       to translate it all

131
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,354
         from Old Ponish
        and there it was!

132
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,623
        Zecora was right!

133
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,125
        The Mystical Mask
      wasn't just a legend.

134
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,094
             The Mystical Mask
           was MAGE MEADOWBROOK!

135
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,365
      The ancient sorceress
       from Hayseed Swamp?

136
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,567
        We studied her at
       Celestia's school.

137
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,836
          Are you sure!?

138
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,204
           Absolutely!

139
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,339
     Mage Meadowbrook wasn't
        just a sorceress,

140
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,107
         she was also a
      healer and back then,

141
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,811
   healers wore masks so they
  wouldn't get sick themselves!

142
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:29,080
       Fluttershy, I am so
     incredibly proud of you

143
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,917
     for using your research
   skills to figure this out!

144
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,285
But... Meadowbrook
lived ages ago and...

145
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,987
Didn't she disappear?

146
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,056
             Mm hm. But if we go
             to Hayseed Swamp,

147
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,891
      maybe we can find
      something she left behind.

148
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,826
            Something that could
            lead to a cure!

149
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,396
   It seems like a long shot,
   but I guess it's possible.

150
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:49,500
We have to try! I've got
our route all planned out

151
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,236
and on the way we can
check up on Zecora and--

152
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,239
               Whoa, whoa, whoa.
              We're leaving<i> now?</i>

153
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,040
           Of course!

154
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,508
 Every second we spend waiting,

155
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,044
       is a second Zecora
      is coughing bubbles!

156
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,045
         But Fluttershy,
       you haven't slept.

157
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,647
   And that's a long journey.

158
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,383
  There's no use trying to talk
    me out of this, Twilight!

159
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,752
We've got no
time to waste!

160
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,188
               Can we at least
            grab some breakfast!?

161
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,857
   I packed cauliflower bites.

162
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,493
                  Aww. No sweet
                 potato muffins?

163
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,729
     I.. uh.. ate them all.

164
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,364
They were actually
really good.

165
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,739
...and that's when I
realized the Mystical Mask

166
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,942
was actually Mage
Meadowbrook!

167
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,978
     [cough]
<i> That's marvelous, Fluttershy!</i>

168
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,779
     <i> I am quite impressed.</i>

169
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,415
       <i> While you're gone</i>
        <i> on your journey</i>

170
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,117
<i>I'll try not to be</i> ...<i> worried.</i>

171
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,188
[gasp] Oh, no! Zecora,
you didn't rhyme!

172
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,890
You must be getting worse!

173
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,992
   <i> Oh! No, no, no! Not at all...</i>

174
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,795
 <i> Something, something... ball?</i>

175
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,230
             Achoo!

176
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,033
Ah! That's it!

177
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,334
We have to go now!

178
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,936
    Lead the way, Fluttershy!

179
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,961
    So... where do you think
       Meadowbrook lived?

180
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,397
          [yawn] I'm not sure.

181
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,866
          Maybe there's
      somepony we can ask.

182
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,969
       I think we might be
      the only ponies here.

183
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,408
  Wait! I recognize that tree!

184
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,581
     Oh! Yes, this has to be it!

185
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,983
       It's just like the
   illustrations of her home!

186
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,386
      Anypony who lives in
       a tree is OK by me.

187
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:53,892
              Phew!

188
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,094
      Well, if the doorway
          is sealed up,

189
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,963
          we just have
       to dig our way in.

190
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,699
   Back up, Twilight; I don't
      want you to get hurt!

191
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,269
                 Or we could try
                   the handle.

192
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,808
        It really blends
        in with the bark.

193
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,976
          Easy to miss.

194
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:18,349
  Wow, it looks like this place
  has been abandoned for years.

195
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,654
         [gasp] Twilight! Look!

196
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:26,058
 It's the same kind of lily pad
  that gave Zecora Swamp Fever!

197
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,494
     Hmm. I wonder if Meadowbrook
     was looking for a cure

198
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:30,996
      for Swamp Fever too.

199
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,031
   [gasp] Do you think she found it?

200
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,067
    I hope so. But let's not
     get ahead of ourselves.

201
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,538
       That's exactly what
       I'm talking about.

202
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,807
   You're making your excited
        squeaking noise.

203
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,311
     Uh, I wasn't making my
    excited squeaking noise.

204
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,517
     Ahhhhhhhhhh!!

205
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,619
  Y'all can stop screaming now.

206
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,254
    Didn't mean to scare ya.

207
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,789
        I do that a lot.

208
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,157
          Scare ponies?

209
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,992
  Or rock creepily in the dark?

210
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,762
Well.. both, I s'pose.

211
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,463
Name's Cattail.

212
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,765
Pleased to meet ya!

213
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,968
Likewise, but um, may I ask,

214
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,170
why are you in Mage
Meadowbrook's home?

215
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,506
  Oh, I take care of the place.

216
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,541
   I ain't much of a cleaner but..

217
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,044
       from what I hear,
      my kin wasn't either,

218
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,981
  so I doubt they'd mind a few
 cobwebs in our ancestral home.

219
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,184
              [gasp] You're related to
               Mage Meadowbrook?

220
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,252
      Mm hm.

221
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,320
              Oh, my goodness,
            Twilight, we did it!

222
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,090
Not only did we find Mage
Meadowbrook's old house,

223
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,726
we actually found one
of her descendants!

224
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,195
              Honestly, I would
            not have guessed it.

225
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,031
       So, you lookin' for
     some kind of cure, huh?

226
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,801
        Well, now, I know
      Meadowbrook was known

227
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,003
      to always be writing
        in her journals.

228
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,373
  If she had the cure you want,
 I reckon that's where it'd be.

229
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,109
Come on! I'll show
ya the library.

230
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,978
          Library? Now
         we're talking!

231
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,953
    Oh. Well, libraries come
    in all shapes and sizes.

232
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,421
          This is good!

233
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,856
     It'll take us less time
    to go through everything.

234
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,565
<i>"Today my mom made me eat peas.</i>
 <i> Peas are yucky."</i>

235
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,867
     And... we can probably
         skip this one.

236
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,869
     Unless she found a cure
     when she was a foal...

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,942
        Also not helpful.

240
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,210
    But I do kind of want to
       see where it goes.

241
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:27,334
         Huh.

242

00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,958
    <i> Today I cured Mother and</i>
     <i> the rest of the bayou.</i>

267
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,194
  <i> It was the greatest feeling</i>
     <i> I've ever experienced</i>

268
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,062
        <i> and I promise to</i>
        <i> dedicate my life</i>

269
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,865
      <i> to curing ponies all</i>
        <i> over Equestria.</i>

270
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,201
                  Cattail: And she did just that.

271
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,471
       Right up till she
    disappeared without a trace.

272
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,507
So all we have to do is find
those aggressive Flash Bees

273
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,409
      and get them to give
         us their honey!

274
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,280
      Of course, it doesn't
      say how she did that.

275
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,385
     What? Is my mane messy?

276
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,387
     I know I haven't slept
        in a while but...

277
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:29,727
       [gasp] Oh, no! I've caught
          Swamp Fever!

278
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,534
              Huh?

279
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,774
       Are you sure these
         are necessary?

280
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:44,609
  What?

281
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,812
      I said, are you sure
      these are necessary?

282
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:51,749
YES! I won't risk
infecting you or Cattail.

283
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,152
       What you can't risk
     is getting any sicker.

284
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,921
     If you don't rest, your
  symptoms will only get worse.

285
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,925
          Mm-hm. You really should rest
            up before going up

286
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,961
                   against those
                    Flash Bees.

287
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,063
        They are nasty critters.

288
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,265
       Um, you don't know
         this about me,

289
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,734
         but I'm pretty
       good with animals.

290
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,836
And besides, Dogtail...

291
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,104
                      Cattail.

292
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,907
  Um, Zecora is counting on me.

293
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,743
I have to help her just like
Meadowbrook helped her mother

294
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,245
   and all those bayou
    ponies long ago.

295
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,414
       But Fluttershy, as
       much as Meadowbrook

296
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,083
took care of other ponies,

297
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,385
        I'm sure she also
      took care of herself!

298
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,189
       You're not going to
    change my mind, Twilight!

299
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:34,224
       Ooh. For being sick, she
         sure is strong.

300
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,365
     Cattail: The Flash Bee
     hive is just up yonder.

301
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,867
     Are you sure you don't
    want me to come with you?

302
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,403
          No, it's too
      dangerous, Twilight.

303
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,372
      Besides, I've already
     gotten one friend hurt.

304
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,408
         I won't let it
       happen to another.

305
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,512
         Phew. OK, Fluttershy.
        You can do this!

306
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,588
        Mind over matter!

307
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,540
Hello, Flash Bees!

308
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,042
I was hoping I could
get some of your honey.

309
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,614
           Oh, I see.

310
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,149
 You don't let others have any.

311
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,252
Well, I'm sorry, but
I<i> really</i> need it.

312
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,156
      Huh. I didn't want it to
      have to come to this

313
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,891
  but I'll just have to use...

314
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,093
The Stare.

315
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,437
         You really are
           aggressive.

316
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,146
            Oh, dear.

317
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,989
   Ooh. What happened? Where am I?

318
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,624
     Oh. I'm so glad you're OK!

319
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,460
         You're still in
       Meadowbrook's tree.

320
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:19,497
  You fainted but Twilight shot
  some magic up and caught ya.

321
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,132
          It was crazy.

322
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,933
Goodness gracious!

323
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,170
Have you heard from Zecora?

324
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,405
  Is she OK?

325
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:28,640
              Uh...

326
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:32,744
  We got word your zebra friend
  has started sprouting leaves.

327
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,580
          She's already
      turning into a tree?

328
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,582
         I thought we'd
         have more time.

329
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,351
      Actually, you've been
     asleep for three days.

330
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,519
           Three days!?

331
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:43,721
                  Mm hm.

332
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,090
You were asleep so long, we were
   afraid you wouldn't be able

333
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,458
    to move when you woke up,

334
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,927
     but thankfully you just
       wore yourself down.

335
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:50,995
    Oh, dear.

336
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,563
         We have to get
        back to the hive.

337
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,198
    I've wasted so much time-

338
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,534
Now hang on there,
Fluttershy,

339
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,803
those Flash Bee
critters are tricky.

340
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,070
Cattail's right.

341
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,440
I can't even use magic
to calm them down.

342
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,475
We'll have to find another
way to get the honey.

343
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,345
     We've tried everything
         from disguises

344
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:10,080
        to things I won't
         even speak of.

345
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,918
He's been through a lot
these past three days.

346
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,152
             Wait...

347
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,187
          disguises...

348
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:27,064
        [gasp] That's it!

349
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,366
     I know how she did it!

350
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,467
     I know how Meadowbrook
         got the honey!

351
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,909
   <i> This</i> is how Meadowbrook got
 the honey from the Flash Bees.

352
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,078
    She threw a mask at 'em?

353
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,180
   I wouldn't recommend that.

354
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:45,683
    No. The male bees aren't
 aggressive around the queen bee

355
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,753
   and this mask has the same
     stripes that she does!

356
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,688
  Fluttershy, that's brilliant!

357
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,123
                      A-A-Achoo!

358
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,425
Whoa!

359
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,460
       There's no time to waste!

360
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,828
Hooves crossed!

361
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,833
    Oh, golly, I can't watch!

362
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,737
        Mind over matter!

363
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:25,990
            Twilight!

364
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,258
          It's working!

365
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,505
I think she's cured
now, Fluttershy.

366
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:45,810
      <i> Oh, I do feel fine,
   <i> and this honey is divine</i>.

367
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,679
                    Oh, you're
                  rhyming again!

368
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,015
                   Welcome back,
                    my friend!

369
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,918
     <i> Thank you Fluttershy,</i>
      <i> for all you endured.</i>

370
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,988
       <i> If not for you, I</i>
      <i> would not be cured.</i>

371
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,457
      Oh.. If it wasn't for me,

372
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,193
     you wouldn't have been
    sick in the first place!

373
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,095
       <i> Regret is not what</i>
        <i> you should feel,</i>

374
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,599
    <i> because on this journey,</i>
  <i> you've learned a great deal.</i>

375
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,001
                   That's true.

376
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,770
 I certainly learned that if you
  don't take care of yourself,

377
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,539
    you won't be able to take
      care of anypony else.

378
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,810
 In fact, if I had rested, like
  Twilight suggested all along,

379
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,413
  maybe I would have thought to
 use Meadowbrook's mask sooner.

380
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,118
       Please tell me you
         found the cure.

381
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,088
             A-Achoo!

382
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,212
              Achoo!
