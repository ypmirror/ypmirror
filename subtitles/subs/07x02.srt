1
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:08,336
Come on, come on! Turn
into a tea cup.

2
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:12,024
No. Tea cup!

3
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:16,576
No! Tea cup! No!

4
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:22,004
Starlight, I can't put a
trick that's not working

5
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:25,000
into my act. How come
it's not working?

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,400
It could be because you're
just yelling "tea cup"

7
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:30,516
and not picturing
it in your mind.

8
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:33,240
Oh. Yeah, that
could be it.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,100
What does your
tea cup look like?

10
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:36,908
What shape is
it? What color?

11
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:44,792
Woo! Starlight, I
did it!

12
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:49,736
I did it, I did it,
I did it!

13
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:50,856
Hey!

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,264
Tea cup! Tea cup!
Tea cup! Tea cup! Tea cup!

15
00:00:55,656 --> 00:01:00,668
Teeeaa Cup! Tea Cup!
Tea Cup! Teeeaa Cup!

16
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:02,904
You know what you
need? A tea cup!

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,412
Oh!

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,828
Whoops, I guess I
pictured a tea cup poodle.

19
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,948
Trixie, you ruined
my tea cakes!

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,572
I just got excited!

21
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:22,552
This is the first time I
did a transfiguration spell.

22
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:27,056
Real magic! C'mon.
Be impressed by me!

23
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:28,960
"Yay Trixie!

24
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:32,148
You are so great at magic
and having good hair."

25
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:37,160
Good job, Trix, but
I was baking these to give

26
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,531
to Twilight and the girls for
their friendship retreat.

27
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:41,620
Pinkie Pie gave me her
recipe and everything.

28
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:44,244
Oh, you need some snacks
to give to Twilight?

29
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:46,056
I've got you covered.

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,376
Problem solved!

31
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:59,728
Not exactly.

32
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:10,890

 The Legend say the tea cup poodle is still roaming free to this day!
https://yp1.yayponies.no

33
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:43,452
I am so excited for this
friendship retreat!

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,880
I can't remember the last
time we all got to hang out

35
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:47,648
without having to
save Equestria!

36
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,048
Well, we are awesome,

37
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:53,128
but technically we weren't the
last ponies to save Equestria.

38
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:56,900
I was speaking in
a broader sense!

39
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:59,096
Are you sure you don't
want to come with us?

40
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,548
Yeah, I have three new
comics to get through.

41
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:04,536
And I promised Trixie
we'd practice more magic.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,132
It might be better if
the castle was empty

43
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:08,420
if you know what I mean.

44
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,028
Relax. If
anything breaks,

45
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:14,132
Starlight will just go back
in time and fix it.

46
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:18,352
Kidding!

47
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:21,572
We'll take good care of the
castle while you're gone.

48
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,620
Have fun on your
friendship retreat!

49
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,764
What in Equestria is a
friendship retreat, anyway?

50
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:30,588
They're gonna bond, share
laughs and if I know them,

51
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,032
they're gonna
sing a song.

52
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,316
We are gonna have so
much more fun than them.

53
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:37,280
Shhh!

54
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:42,532
Twilight, wait! Starlight
has something for you!

55
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,420
Huh?

56
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:48,032
Here, I, um, brought you snacks.

57
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,428
Oh. How thoughtful. Thanks.

58
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,456
We will... not get
hungry on the train.

59
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,236
It was supposed to be tea
cakes, but it's a long story.

60
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,248
Have a great time.

61
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,180
You, too!

62
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:11,780
OK Trixie, what kind of spells
did you want to work on next?

63
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:15,128
Well, every
self-respecting magician

64
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:16,604
has a disappearing act

65
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,308
so maybe we could
start with that?

66
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,020
Hmm. Nothing just disappears
so that's technically

67
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,188
a teleportation spell and
those are pretty hard.

68
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,568
Maybe we should start
with something smaller.

69
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,736
No no no no. The great
and powerful Trixie

70
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:36,772
goes big or not at all!
Just tell me how you do it.

71
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,676
Well, I've always found
magic is tied to my emotions.

72
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:44,100
Whatever I'm feeling
fuels whatever I'm doing

73
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:47,000
and the stronger I'm feeling,
the stronger the magic.

74
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:51,680
Right. Like when you were
so upset that Cutie Marks

75
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,820
took away your friend, your
magic was strong enough

76
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,460
to enslave an
entire village.

77
00:04:57,612 --> 00:05:00,112
Yup. Thanks for
bringing that up.

78
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:02,408
See? I'm already learning!

79
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,988
If anypony is going
to teach me

80
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,868
how to do a
disappearing spell...

81
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:07,088
Teleportation spell.

82
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:10,740
Whatever. I'm
complimenting you! And me.

83
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:12,944
We can do this
cause we're amazing

84
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,536
and magic is
friendship and stuff.

85
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,696
I guess we can
give it a whirl.

86
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:22,084
Now we just need to find
you something to teleport.

87
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,632
Spike? How bout it?

88
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,896
Ha ha.

89
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,632
Let's pick something, I
don't know, not living.

90
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:33,020
I mean, it won't be as
impressive, but OK.

91
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,992
Teach away, mini Twilight.

92
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:39,716
Welcome to
Manehattan Escapes!

93
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:42,172
I'm going to start
with a facial

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,752
and then get my
hooves done.

95
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,344
Oh. It's not that
kind of retreat.

96
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,508
Isn't it called
Manehattan Escapes

97
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:50,056
because it's a deluxe spa

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,812
where you can escape
all of your troubles?

99
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:55,104
Nope. It's because we
get locked in a room

100
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:56,776
and we have to solve
puzzles and riddles

101
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:57,948
in order to escape!

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,440
The clues will lead you
to a key to get out.

103
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,120
Team building!

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,528
Come on, girls.
This could be fun.

105
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:11,476
"Could be"? Some of the
brightest minds in Equestria

106
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,960
put together
these puzzles!

107
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,512
I'm just happy to
be with all of you.

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,140
Me too! I'm not great
at solving riddles,

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,232
but I'm super great at
cheering other ponies on

110
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:25,260
while they do it. GO
US! Oha oha! Woohoo!

111
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:28,828
Yes, yes woohoo,
but just so we know,

112
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:31,860
exactly how long will
we be locked in here?

113
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,396
A group of Griffons set the
record for the fastest escape.

114
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,088
It only took them an hour.

115
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:41,496
Pssh. Griffons barely
like each other!

116
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,088
We're basically the poster
ponies for amazing friendships

117
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,692
so get your quill ready, bub.

118
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,400
You're gonna have to
write down a new record.

119
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,856
If you master this spell
before the girls get back,

120
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:55,636
you'd be setting
some kind of record.

121
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,524
Challenge accepted.

122
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,768
OK, what you want to do is
concentrate on the object

123
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,284
that you want to teleport.

124
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:06,328
Yeah, I'm gonna go...
all the way over here.

125
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:11,892
Concentrate on teleporting,
got it. Doin' the spell!

126
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:13,500
No Trix, wait. Not just--

127
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,992
Nonononononono!

128
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,176
You made Twilight's
Friendship Map disappear!

129
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,048
Ahem. Teleport.

130
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:37,136
Really?!

131
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:40,352
Well, it was behind the apple,
it was bound to happen.

132
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:43,240
On the plus side, my
magic is getting better.

133
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:47,104
I made a whole table go poof!
That was pretty impressive.

134
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,936
Trixie, we have to
get that map back.

135
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,488
We'll find it.
No big deal.

136
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,784
Twilight's never going
to trust me to be alone

137
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:57,108
in this castle again!
What were you thinking?

138
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:00,108
"Teleport"! Like you told me to!

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,484
No! You're supposed to
concentrate on the object!

140
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:05,160
Not just teleporting!

141
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,648
Well, gee, you probably should
have told me all the steps

142
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,104
before you let me
do the spell.

143
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,656
I TRIED!

144
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:15,856
I... need a minute.

145
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,960
Hey, are you OK?

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,324
I will be, once I cast a
spell to contain my anger

147
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:30,324
in this bottle.

148
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:31,752
Wait, what?

149
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,344
Do you see this
storm cloud?

150
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,147
This has never
happened before.

151
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,700
All this magical
energy has to go somewhere

152
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:41,140
and if I'm not using it
to fight a magical duel

153
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:44,152
or bend my friends' wills
to obey my every command...

154
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,692
Ha. I remember that.

155
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,664
The point is, I don't know
what my magic's going to do.

156
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:53,132
So I'm hoping if I
bottle up my anger,

157
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:56,088
I won't do who-
knows-what to Trixie.

158
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,780
Are you sure that's a good idea?

159
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:02,488
What choice do I have? I've got
to get that map back

160
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:04,576
and I don't want
to lose Trixie.

161
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,824
If she knew what I was
thinking right now,

162
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:08,812
she'd probably never
talk to me again.

163
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,444
OK. You do what
you need to do;

164
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,612
I'll see if I can find the
map somewhere in the castle.

165
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:27,168
Trixie.

166
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:30,116
Oh, there you are.
For a minute

167
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,620
I didn't think you
were coming back

168
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:34,484
and that you might be upset
with me for some weird reason.

169
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,368
But then I remembered
you never get mad at me.

170
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:45,792
Whoo. Nope. Not
mad at all.

171
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,700
So, the map is probably
in the last place

172
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:51,960
you were thinking
of. Where was that?

173
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:56,128
Oooh. Great question. I
wish you'd asked it, like,

174
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:59,468
right after I did the spell.
I don't remember anymore.

175
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:05,788
No worries. We'll just
take a walk around town.

176
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,516
Maybe that will
jog your memory.

177
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:09,952
OK, that sounds
fun. Oooh!

178
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:11,440
Did you remember?

179
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:14,808
No. But I did think we could
stop for cinnamon nuts

180
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,848
while we're out!

181
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:17,980
Cinnamon nuts?!

182
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:21,280
That's a good idea.

183
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:24,132
Yes! I've been craving
something sweet

184
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,336
since I couldn't have any
tea cakes this morning.

185
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:29,088
Whoo!

186
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,228
You got this, Starlight.

187
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:35,864
Woohoo! Go Twilight,
you can do it!

188
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:40,236
Woohoo!

189
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:43,776
Hoo-wee! You solved that
triangle-y thing mighty fast.

190
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:46,816
Does anypony need
a purple jewel?

191
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:49,176
Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?

192
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,384
Don't both those
fruits mean "purple"?

193
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:55,640
Yes, but one's a lovely purple
and one's...well...icky.

194
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:59,580
Just put the gem in! We're
trying to set a record here!

195
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,732
Yay, we solved another clue!

196
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,804
Cause our friendship is so true!

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,832
Yay us! Woohooo!

198
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:20,944
Oh, hello Fillies,
how can I help you?

199
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,544
Ooh, are those
cinnamon nuts?

200
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,908
Mmm Yes! I got them
from the cart outside.

201
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,192
They're delicious.
Do you want some?

202
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,956
Have you seen a big
table? Magical map on it?

203
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,756
Sometimes glowing
cutie marks shoot out?

204
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,792
Uhh big ta--No. No.

205
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:39,032
Why in Equestria would
something like that be in here?

206
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:43,936
Well, I cast a pretty amazing
spell that transported it

207
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,824
to the last place
I was thinking of.

208
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,812
But I might have been thinking
about how I'd treat myself

209
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,200
to a nice brooch instead.

210
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,032
Ah. Well, no huge table here.

211
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:56,180
Are you still interested
in that brooch?

212
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:57,216
Sure!

213
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:57,980
No!

214
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:01,136
We don't have
time for this!

215
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,592
Twilight and the girls
are gonna be back soon.

216
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:08,128
But I'm not upset.
What's our next stop?

217
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,140
Nope. I ain't seen it.

218
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,296
Are you sure?

219
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,472
It's really really
important that we find it.

220
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:22,200
And it might be here because
somepony was craving apples.

221
00:12:23,128 --> 00:12:26,836
I'm still craving them. They'd
go so well with cinnamon nuts!

222
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:30,560
Them nuts sure
do smell good!

223
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:33,880
Granny Smith.
Please. The table?

224
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,732
My eyes ain't what
they used to be

225
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,784
but I'd know fer sure if
a big ole table dun appear

226
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:42,148
out of thin air!

227
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,992
Darn. I could've
have sworn it'd be

228
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,632
at the ice cream parlor,
because it was warm

229
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:54,456
in the castle and I
thought I wanted ice cream.

230
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,484
Ooh! Maybe we should check
out the Crystal Empire

231
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:58,344
because Twilight's castle
is made out of crystals

232
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,284
so I totally had
crystals on my mind.

233
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:05,236
OK. We'd better start moving
if we want to make it

234
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,552
to the Crystal Empire.

235
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,180
Are you OK, Starlight?

236
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:12,968
Because you seem a little...
what's the word? Uck la la.

237
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,796
Nope. I am great.

238
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,436
Did your saddle
bag just glow?

239
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:20,396
No.

240
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:20,944
Gimmee.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,792
No.

242
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:22,352
Give it here.

243
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,060
No. Don't

244
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:25,168
CINNAMON NUTS!

245
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,952
I've had a hankerin'
for these all day!

246
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:33,172
Me too, ever since that
Trixie came by with them.

247
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:54,956
Um. Why are they
looking at me like that?

248
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,868
Whoa!

249
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,256
You ruined my
tea cakes!

250
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,060
What?!

251
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:11,556
You just had to give Twilight
those smelly pretzels.

252
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,512
Were they your pretzels?
I don't understand.

253
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:18,124
YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION WHEN
I'M TRYING TO TEACH YOU!

254
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:20,924
Starlight, can you
help me? Please!

255
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,240
Twilight, can you
help me please?

256
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:28,156
I've seen those
symbols over here!

257
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,428
You can do it!

258
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,904
Almost there!

259
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:36,068
I've got the key!

260
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,284
This is it! I'm
so impressed.

261
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,916
I'm not! I knew
we were the best!

262
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:45,768
You're the worst!

263
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,128
That seems harsh.

264
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:50,028
Aaah! Starlight!

265
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:53,844
I don't know what's
happening! Starlight! Help!

266
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,864
I'm glad Twilight
isn't here to see this.

267
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:00,552
I wish that Starlight was here

268
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,228
to see how strong
friendships can be

269
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:04,092
when we trust each
other and work together!

270
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:06,800

right about now!

286
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,484

But um, you know
the game isn't over

301
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,568
until you turn that key.

302
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:05,220
AHH!

303
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:09,600
Did we do it?

304
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:15,692
So close. You missed the
griffon record by two seconds.

305
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:18,584
Probably shouldn't
have sung that song.

306
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,508
AWW NUTS!

307
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,980
AHHHHHHH!

308
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:25,320
Nuts!

309
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,920
YOU JUST DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO!

310
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:35,796
Starlight!

311
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:40,604
And you don't always have
to bring up my dark past!

312
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,084
I didn't know you had
one, Granny Smith!

313
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,056
I just can't believe you
sometimes! You make me so MAD!

314
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,856
I barely even know you!

315
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:57,764
I don't understand why
you're all so mad at me!

316
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,736
They're not. I am.

317
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,508
You are?

318
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm really...
mad at you.

319
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,764
You lost Twilight's
map table;

320
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,612
you make jokes like
it's no big deal.

321
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:17,616
It's like you
don't even care

322
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,504
you could get me in
a lot of trouble.

323
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,016
If we can't find
that table,

324
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:23,132
Twilight's never going
to trust me again.

325
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:24,548
And the worst part is

326
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,968
you didn't even
say you were sorry!

327
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:32,272
I... I'm sorry. I had no
idea you felt that way.

328
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:34,156
Yeah. I do.

329
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,976
But to be fair, I don't know
how you could have known.

330
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:41,788
I did a spell. I
bottled up my anger,

331
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:45,272
but when the bottle broke,
it infected these three.

332
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:50,936
I'm really sorry; I used magic
so I wouldn't use magic.

333
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:53,284
I should have guessed
that would backfire.

334
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:56,824
Oh, that's all right.
It was a slow day.

335
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:00,260
Yeah. I was gonna get
my dentures cleaned

336
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:02,008
before y'all showed up.

337
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,824
Oh, no. My nut cart!

338
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:11,288
Yay! My nut cart!

339
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,232
Hang on; don't you
work at the spa?

340
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:20,076
I'm late for my other job!
What, I wear many hats.

341
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,788
Not gonna lie, hearing you
and those random ponies

342
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:29,840
say all those terrible
things about me wasn't easy.

343
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,400
But I needed to hear it.

344
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,064
Why didn't you just
tell me how you felt?

345
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,420
I didn't want to
lose you as a friend.

346
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:41,028
Pfft. Come on! It'd take a lot
more than that to lose me.

347
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:44,368
Our friendship is stronger
than a few angry words.

348
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,532
And a magical
temper tantrum?

349
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:49,636
Listen, I'd take that
over the boring pony

350
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,336
you were becoming any day.

351
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:56,156
The Starlight I love is
passionate, lively and yeah,

352
00:19:56,212 --> 00:20:00,000
sometimes angry. Those are
my favorite parts of you.

353
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:03,944
That and the fact that you
forgive me every time.

354
00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:08,092
I'll forgive you
if you forgive me.

355
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,192
Deal.

356
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:12,036
I remember what I
was thinking about!

357
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,196
You're kidding me.

358
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
There's more to
it than that.

359
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:21,204
I was thinking about how
glad I am to have met you

360
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:22,772
and I remembered
our first meeting:

361
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,456
here at the Ponyville Spa.

362
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:28,008
And now I just have
to teleport it back.

363
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:29,396
No no no no noooo!

364
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:38,260
A little to the left.
Now rotate it just a hair.

365
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:39,876
Hey, girls!
How'd it go?

366
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,628
Nothing.

367
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:43,720
What?

368
00:20:44,424 --> 00:20:46,648
Let's just say I learned
a friendship lesson

369
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:47,532
while you were gone.

370
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:49,124
You've barely graduated

371
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:53,340
and you're already taking
initiative! Oh. So proud.

372
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:57,676
We learned about team building
and problem solving--

373
00:20:58,072 --> 00:20:59,752
--and when not to sing songs!

374
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,776
We certainly had
a good time,

375
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,724
but I really was looking
forward to a spa day.

376
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:09,144
And the Ponyville spa
is still open. Anyone?

377
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:11,132
Sounds good to me!
I reckon I could use that.
I have a coupon!

378
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,864
We'll meet you there!

379
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,408
Quick. Do you have a spell
that will make the Spa Ponies

380
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:19,232
forget that the map
table was there?

381
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:20,792
Haven't you learned anything

382
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,228
about using magic to
solve your problems?

383
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:28,396
No. If we learn that lesson,
how will we ever have fun?
