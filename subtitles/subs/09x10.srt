           Besides...

275
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,696
      Big Mac can make time
     in the schedule for us

276
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,031
      to set traps, right?

  if we haven't bucked 'em yet?

293

    Seems like more work of
    the Great Seedling to me.

         How'd ya mean?

295

      The closer you get to
      catchin' the critter,

296
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,770
  the more mischievous he gets.

297
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,638
You're sayin' the Great Seedling

298
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,374
      is taking our apples?

299
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:53,844
  Yes. Sounds like he's fixing
  to throw you off the scent!

300
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,847
 Have you ever heard of anypony

301
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,349
     actually catching him?

302
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:03,020
   Oh, there are stories, but
   it's hard to say for sure.

303
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,756
   He is quite the trickster.

304
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,225
      Guess that's why the
      reward is so great

305
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,693
      if you CAN trap him.

306
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,565
      Well, his tricks have
      given me an idea!

307
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,234
   Setting traps is one thing,

308
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,169
     but I reckon if we keep
    watch over the trees

309
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,370
    that haven't been bucked,

310
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,172
       the Seedling won't
       know what hit him!

311
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:25,376
  That's a great idea! Anypony
  else wanna stay up with us?

    I couldn't've been
     much more than a foal.

328
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,158
    I remember our parents
    tuckin' Big Mac and me in

329
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,728
    and telling us all about
