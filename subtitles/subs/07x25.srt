1
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:05,839
 Starswirl: The best elements
  within us can spread light

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:09,709
  and virtue and I know ponies
     who represent them all:

3
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:17,083
   strength, bravery, healing,
    beauty, hope and sorcery.

4
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,687
   Myself and these Pillars of
Equestria were gathered together

5
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,924
     by another to maintain
       and share the light

6
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,260
    of these powerful ideals.

7
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:31,564
 But we soon came to believe the
  pony who brought us together,

8
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,468
        only wanted that
       power for himself.

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,138
       Cast out and alone,
       this power-mad pony

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,275
      turned to darkness to
       satisfy his thirst.

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,045
        Transformed into
       a Pony of Shadows,

12
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:50,583
   he returned for revenge, to
  extinguish the Pillars' light

13
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,253
   and rob the world of hope.

14
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:58,124
 To stop him, the Pillars and I
  must make a grave sacrifice.

15
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:03,129
   But we shall leave behind a
   seed in hopes that one day

16
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:07,166
  it will grow into a force to
   stand against the darkness

17
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,468
          for all time.

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,240
   We must now face the fiend
   with the only plan we have.

19
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,043
"I only hope it will be enough."

20
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,178
     That's the last entry.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,882
   And maybe Starswirl's final
    words before he vanished!

22
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,257
      I've always wondered
   what happened to Starswirl.

23
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,627
This is quite a
discovery, Sunburst.

24
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,596
        So it's genuine?

25
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,998
    You can verify that this
     journal really belonged

26
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,499
    to Starswirl the Bearded!?

27
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,667
                    Indeed.

28
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,536
      From the looks of it,
     the last thing he wrote

29
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,839
        before facing the
        Pony of Shadows.

30
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:25,177
       Uh, so, the Pony of
    Shadows was really real?

31
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,046
It appears so.

32
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,015
We never met the other
Pillars and we were too young

33
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,184
to understand the
danger they faced.

34
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,719
             Hold on a second now!

35
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,688
       All those legendary
      ponies were real too?

36
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,891
And they went off with Starswirl
   to face the Pony of Shadows

37
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,794
   and then none of them were
     ever heard from again?

38
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,798
               Ah-ha, yeah. Weren't
                you listening?

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,467
        But what happened
          to them all?

40
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,035
         They must have
      defeated the villain,

41
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,504
     since Equestria's still
     full of light and hope.

42
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,140
              But how? And where
                 did they go?

43
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,543
My Olde Ponish
is a bit rusty,

44
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,245
but I wonder if the answers
can be found somewhere

45
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,247
within the pages
of this book.

46
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,117
Well, I just happen to be
an expert in Olde Ponish.

47
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,820
    I mean, I've practically
  memorized every ancient text

48
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,655
    about Starswirl there is.

49
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,725
Seriously. All
   of them.

50
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,627
      We have fond memories
       of our old teacher.

51
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,662
      If you could discover
      what happened to him,

52
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,397
   we would be most grateful.

53
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,835
  Solving a thousands-year-old
   mystery could take forever!

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,907
   Think of the research, the
 re-reading, the re-re-reading.

55
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,812
You might find
you need help.

56
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:37,115
    Luckily, she's got a whole
   bushel of helpers right here.

57
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,150
            Totally!

58
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:42,654
   Uh, how long will all this
     research take, exactly?

59
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,856
         Let's get this
       back to my library.

60
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,325
    I'm sure we'll figure out
    what happened in no time.

61
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,535
    Figure it out yet, Twilight?

62
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,073
            Wha-WHAT?

63
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,774
    What did you figure out?

64
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,476
[gasp] You figured something out!?

65
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,879
           What is it?

66
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,480
            [sigh] Nothing.

67
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,583
      I mean, Starswirl was
      a genius, obviously,

68
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,151
     but forget Olde Ponish.

69
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,686
       There's parts where
         his hornwriting

70
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,321
    is like another language!

71
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,322
              Agh!

72
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,693
[groan] Twilight, we've been
studyin' and referencin'

73
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,764
and cross referencing for
three days straight now.

74
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,800
      Ugh. I haven't spent
     this much time reading

75
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,403
      since the last Daring
        Do book came out.

76
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,472
       Perhaps it is time
        to take a break.

77
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,508
     This mystery is over a
 thousand years old, after all.

78
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,944
       Another day or two
    won't make a difference!

79
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,479
            Two days!?

80
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,046
         I don't want to
       waste two seconds.

81
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,316
     I'm close to an answer.

82
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,251
         I can feel it.

83
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:51,056
        "Hearg sylfum se
     Ponhenge," What's that?

84
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,191
         The Temple of Ponhenge?

85
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,493
              You can read that!?

86
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,528
The hornwriting's
pretty sloppy,

87
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,464
but it's nowhere
near as bad as mine.

88
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:03,636
"Toward dol grimlic
of fola firgenbeorg?"

89
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,239
 At the base of Foal Mountain...

90
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,041
   "User endemest scield... "

91
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,710
              [gasp] Our last stand.

92
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,356
                   Spike: [yawn]

93
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,650
     Well, that sure sounds
       like a clue to me.

94
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:30,662
           This is it.

95
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:31,663
            Ponhenge.

96
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,531
       I can't believe it.

97
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,739
     I've never seen magical
    runes like these before.

98
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:41,673
            Have you?

99
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:42,574
             Uh uh.

100
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:50,014
  I don't think anypony's seen
  any of this for a long time.

101
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,251
   [struggle] Woah!

102
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,522
It'd take a whole team of ponies
  to clear away all this brush.

103
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,893
       Even then, I'm not
       sure we'd find out

104
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,430
      what happened here a
       thousand years ago.

105
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,099
          [sigh] You're right.

106
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,468
  I suppose it was a long shot.

107
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,736
       Cheer up, Twilight.

108
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,372
 Finding a whole set of ancient
   ruins is pretty impressive.

109
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,008
         Maybe you could
      write a paper on it!

110
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,910
  I guess I hoped we'd get here
   and the mystery would just

111
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,611
     magically be explained.

112
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,049
          Uh, Twilight?

113
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,559
           Starswirl..?

114
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,162
           I-- I've wanted to
         meet you my whole life!

115
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,130
                 I can't believe
                  you're here!

116
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,902
I don't think
he is here.

117
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,304
I don't think any
of them are.

118
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,224
           You summon me at your
             peril, Starswirl.

119
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:09,928
 Once I defeat all of you, this
 realm will embrace the darkness

120
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,363
      as I did so long ago.

121
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,745
           Drawing me here will
          only make me stronger.

122
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,247
    You will never defeat me!

123
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,950
         We did not come
       here to defeat you.

124
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,063
       What are you doing?

125
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,366
     We came to contain you.

126
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:52,904
            Aaaaahhh!

127
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,784
Well, you did ask for
a magical explanation!

128
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,661
     Uh, what just happened?

129
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,797
         It looked like
     Starswirl cast a spell

130
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,899
        that banished the
        Pony of Shadows.

131
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,869
Of course! Powerful
magic like that

132
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,771
would leave an impression
on this place.

133
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:29,040
   Bringing the book back here
    let us see what happened.

134
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,476
         Which was what?

135
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,879
  Starswirl and the rest of the
  Pillars sacrificed themselves

136
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,447
       to save Equestria.

137
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,652
It's amazing to think one of the
 greatest mysteries of Equestria

138
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,489
   was solved with a musty old
   book from an antique shop.

139
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,124
But I wouldn't say
the mystery's solved.

140
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,060
Starswirl's spell was one of the
most powerful feats of magic

141
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,629
in all of history.

142
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,932
    It'll take years of study
 before we fully understand it.

143
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,401
      I think I understand
       Starswirl's spell!

144
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,139
   I know I've finished one of
    Starswirl's spells before

145
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,708
      but this one was on a
     whole different level!

146
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,577
       Was it an explosion
      of magical feedback?

147
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,478
          An evocation?

148
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,678
     A kind of incantation?

149
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,115
     It's Starswirl, so the
   possibilities are endless!

150
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,417
     And once Starlight set
      me on the right track

151
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,819
  with his crazy hornwriting--

152
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,554
    [snigger] I mean, he was a genius,

153
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,522
    so I guess we can forgive
      a little messiness --

154
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,492
I went through the journal
again and it's amazing!

155
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,763
      Twilight, darling, we
   understand you're excited,

156
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,231
  but that's all we understand.

157
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,867
What exactly is so amazing?

158
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,002
       Only how Starswirl
      and the other Pillars

159
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,204
        sent the Pony of
        Shadows to limbo!

160
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,873
              They did what now?

161
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,012
    They used their magic to
  open a portal between worlds,

162
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,948
     to limbo and pulled the
     Pony of Shadows inside.

163
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,518
          Darling, your diorama!

164
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,752
          I made more.

165
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,757
 Starswirl thought the only way
   to trap the Pony of Shadows

166
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,926
      in limbo was for the
   Pillars to take him there.

167
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,763
So they got stuck too!

168
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,199
The Pony of Shadows must
have been really awful

169
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,735
for them to do that.

170
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:06,171
 I suppose being trapped for all
 time with a super-duper bad guy

171
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,674
     in limbo might be OK if
    you were doing the limbo,

172
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,209
  but that's still pushing it.

173
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:13,378
The thing is, I think
I can get them out.

174
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,081
   Twilight, are you serious?

175
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:19,784
      You can save the most
  legendary ponies of all time?

176
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,986
     I don't know..

177
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:25,257
 Opening portals between worlds
  didn't work out well for me.

178
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,292
Are you sure it's safe?

179
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,228
First of all, you opened
  portals through time.

180
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,397
       And second of all,
    Starswirl wrote the spell

181
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:33,298
       you used to do it.

182
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,434
      If he'd been here, he
     could have stopped it.

183
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,303
       Equestria would be
      safer with him in it.

184
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,771
      We have to save him.

185
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,108
           But you'd be savin'
         all the Pillars, right?

186
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,310
            And they disappeared
                ages ago.

187
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,345
That's the thing
about limbo.

188
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,147
It isn't one
place or another.

189
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,783
It's in between, so
time stands still.

190
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,353
 If we can pull them out, it'll
    be like they never left!

191
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:56,721
    I actually built another
     model to demonstrate--

192
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,322
      Agh!

193
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,858
What can we do to help?

194
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,493
  If I'm right, we need to find
    items that are connected

195
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,029
   to the Pillars in some way.

196
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:07,098
 You mean, like, stuff
that belonged to them?

197
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,934
        How would we know
        what to look for?

198
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,336
            Or where?

199
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,906
       Luckily, Starswirl
      took a lot of notes.

200
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,542
  <i> My compatriots are as varied</i>
      <i> as the realm itself</i>

201
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,111
      <i> and hail from every</i>
      <i> corner of our land,</i>

202
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:23,982
  <i> bringing with them artifacts</i>
 <i> and talismans of great power.</i>

203
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,686
              Um, Twilight, what
                are you doing?

204
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,254
     I'm not doing anything!

205
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,457
       Rockhoof's shovel!

206
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,793
Flash Magnus' shield!

207
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,661
              Mistmane's flower!

208
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,930
       Meadowbrook's mask!

209
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,032
And the blindfold
Somnambula wore

210
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,268
when she faced
that nasty sphinx!

211
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,338
I guess we don't need to figure
out who should get what!

212
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:56,081
        Professor! It's a
     Mighty Helm headpiece!

213
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,850
        Maybe it belonged
      to Rockhoof himself!

214
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,286
   Legends don't wear helmets.

215
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,322
  This belonged to a real pony.

216
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,924
        Applejack: Oh, I
          can guarantee

217
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,293
      Rockhoof was as real
         as you and me.

218
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:14,766
  And I suppose that ravine was
   dug with his trusty shovel

219
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,702
    to save the village from
      an erupting volcano.

220
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:18,770
            Probably.

221
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,207
       I love old legends
       as much as anypony,

222
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,577
but a pony strong enough to save
   a village from rushing lava

223
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,947
 with a shovel is... preposterous!

224
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,095
         I can't believe
       you just did that...

225
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,864
          You saved us!

226
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,633
I bet if you told
somepony else the story,

227
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,569
     it might sound...
     <i> preposterous</i>.

228
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,946
              I suppose some
          stories.. might be true.

229
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,986
     And Rockhoof's appears
       to be one of them!

230
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,864
             [slap]
             OW!

231
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:22,801
           You keep those hooves
           to yourself, dearie!

232
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:26,638
    This place has been in my
     family for generations

233
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,440
      and I'm not about to
     let some whippersnapper

234
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,843
       take the last good
          piece of it!

235
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:36,681
 Time was, ponies came from far
 and wide to see these gardens.

236
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,485
   But that flower's the only
     worthwhile thing left!

237
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,739
Perhaps it just seemed like
your gardens were worthless,

238
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,408
but a little pruning
can work wonders.

239
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,777
       Of course you will
       have to look after

240
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,746
         more than just
         one flower now.

241
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:12,317
            You've given me back
             my family's legacy.

242
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:16,988
   The flower you wanted seems
   like a fair trade for that.

243
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,161
      I can't believe Flash
         Magnus' shield

244
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,297
  ended up in the Dragon Lands.

245
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,333
   Good thing you brought the
 Official Equestrian Friendship

246
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,370
  Ambassador To The Dragons to
 help you navigate our customs.

247
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:34,372
        Like our favorite
      sport: gorge surfing!

248
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:41,246
     Whoo hoo! HA HA AH AH!

249
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:48,020
OK. That was
  awesome!

250
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,523
   Dragon Lord Ember commanded
  us to make peace with ponies,

251
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,560
     but it doesn't mean you
      can surf in our spot.

252
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,597
          Whoa! Fellas.

253
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,699
   As the Official Equestrian
      Friendship Ambassador

254
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,102
 To The Dragons, I have to say,
    that's not very friendly.

255
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,238
                   Garble: Well, what do
                     you know?

256
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,209
     The puny, pony dragon's
  sticking up for his pony pal.

257
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,246
Hey! That's an ancient
    pony artifact.

258
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,849
   Hooves off my gorge board!

259
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,186
    I found it in the desert
      and finders keepers.

260
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,521
 It isn't yours.

261
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,724
  Huh. It sure looks like mine.

262
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:29,227
      But, I might consider
       racing you for it.

263
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:30,962
           No problem.

264
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,031
                      Um, no.

265
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,834
   I mean.. you.

266
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:36,835
   Heh heh.

267
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,513
        On your marks...

268
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:49,781
           Get set...

269
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,982
              Surf!

270
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:08,666
    [pants] I won? I won! WOOO-HOOO!

271
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,636
   Give up the shield, Garble.

272
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:15,406
Lord Ember only commanded
us to be nice to ponies.

273
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:20,278
She never said anything
about pony-loving dragons.

274
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,218
     Uh.. since Dragon Lord Ember
      commanded you

275
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,721
   to make peace with ponies,
    you can't very well

276
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,290
       attack one of their
        friends, can you?

277
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,360
     I guess we'll find out!

278
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,970
      Ugh. Why is he always
      hiding behind ponies?

279
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,606
         I wasn't hiding when I
        beat you down the ridge.

280
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,308
You fell.

281
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,244
Wow, you must be slow, if
all Spike had to do to win

282
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,713
         was fall down.

283
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,347
I'm faster than you.

284
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,282
                       Doubt it.

285
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:57,983
Fine.

286
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,784
 I'll race you back to the top.

287
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,387
       If you win, you can
      have your pony junk.

288
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:07,359
But if I win, you'll leave
and I get to give it to him!

289
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,695
     Fine. I'm pretty sure I
     could beat you anyway,

290
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,531
    but with that heavy hunk
     of metal on your back,

291
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,300
        it'll be a snap.

292
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,702
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Thanks for the tip.

293
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,571
    See ya at the top, loser!

294
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,580
        Hey! That's mine!

295
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,416
   Finders keepers, remember?

296
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,619
See, because that's
what you said to them

297
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,086
when they first
showed up and--

298
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,998
      Just remember not to
  turn away from them, Cattail.

299
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,634
       Flash bees can get
       pretty aggressive.

300
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,803
   I guess that's why none of
     the other bayou animals

301
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:52,971
      can get to the water.

302
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,041
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to wear the mask

303
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,277
that calms the bees?

304
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,614
 It would... if I didn't have to
 fly up here to move their hive.

305
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,184
             There!

306
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,791
  Now the other bayou creatures
      can get to the water

307
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,793
        without the bees
       feeling threatened.

308
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,530
You know, you didn't
have to help with this.

309
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:21,065
I would've lent you
the mask anyway.

310
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,734
                     I know. [giggle]

311
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,536
            But I couldn't leave
              without helping.

312
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,474
    I don't think anypony can
     find anything in there.

313
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,243
         I wouldn't give
        up hope just yet.

314
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,085
     This old blindfold was
       stuck in the drain.

315
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,221
Weren't you looking
for a blindfold?

316
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,689
            Oh, yeah!

317
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,863
  I can't believe I'm going to
   meet Starswirl the Bearded,

318
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,798
 you know, outside of my dreams..

319
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,234
I can't believe you're actually
going through with it.

320
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,436
        What do you mean?

321
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,639
     I'm all for pushing the
      envelope, obviously,

322
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,208
     but this is pretty out
    there for you, Twilight.

323
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,511
 What's "out there" about saving
    the most legendary ponies

324
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,580
      of all time from a
   thousands year-old prison?

325
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,651
       Well, nothing when
      you say it like that.

326
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,087
   Unless "the most legendary
       ponies of all time"

327
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:19,057
  knew what they were doing and
   we shouldn't mess with it.

328
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,627
I'm sure Starswirl and the
Pillars did the best they could

329
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,930
back then, but magic
has come a long way,

330
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,333
mostly because of
the work they did.

331
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,735
      That's true. And you
       did get your wings

332
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,837
      from finishing one of
       Starswirl's spells.

333
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,840
Exactly.

334
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:40,044
 But, then I messed with one and
 nearly destroyed the universe,

335
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,112
    so...

336
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,082
    Starlight, Starswirl the
 Bearded is the greatest wizard

337
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,150
         who ever lived.

338
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,686
 The chance to have him back in
  Equestria is worth the risk.

339
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,888
    Spike: That's good news.

340
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,925
  Otherwise, we'd have brought
    this shield for nothing!

341
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,860
   Applejack: I hope you don't
    think you're the only one

342
00:19:55,962 --> 00:20:00,031
  to find her artifact, because
this here shovel says otherwise.

343
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,600
Honestly, you two...

344
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,569
Not everything is a competition.

345
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,405
         But.. Mistmane's
        flower is by far

346
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,207
       the most attractive
        of the artifacts.

347
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,743
 You're just saying that because
  you didn't have to scuba dive

348
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:14,312
        in a pit of green
       slime to get yours.

349
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,781
    Or move a Flash Bee hive.

350
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,416
       Good work everyone.

351
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,853
         Let's do this!

352
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,910
    What-- What has happened?

353
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,080
 It worked! We brought you back!

354
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,414
            To where?

355
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,250
     You and the others have
      been trapped in limbo

356
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,784
   for over a thousand years,

357
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,720
        but I figured out
       how to get you ho--

358
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:56,687
             What!?

359
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,258
    No, no, no, no! You must
     undo what you've done!

360
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,759
                      What? Why?

361
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,861
                 I mean, I don't
                  think I can.

362
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,264
You cannot
bring us back!

363
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,265
           But I did.

364
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,033
 I brought all the Pillars back.

365
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,402
You cannot bring only
the Pillars back...

366
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,387
            Oh, no...
