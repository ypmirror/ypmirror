1
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,923
No distractions.

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,409
Today is too important.

3
00:00:11,698 --> 00:00:13,883
Reshelving day!

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,026
"Understanding Medieval Equestria"
goes in... Pony History.

5
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:29,063
"Modern Spellcasting" –
that's Classics.

6
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:34,199
"The Art of the To-Do List". Actually,
I kinda wanna read that again.

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,134
Spike! What are you laughing at?

8
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,370
This little beauty. It's my
birthday present to myself.

9
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:45,842
It's a fire ruby.

10
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:50,089
I've been aging it for months.
And it's almost ripe!

11
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,280
Hey! You took my advice!

12
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:06,120
Just use the whole
floor as one big shelf.

13
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,996
Hello! Anypony home? Twilight!

14
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,866
Is that a fire ruby?

15
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:57,094
That must be at least twenty carats!

16
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,433
No inclusions, pristine facets...

17
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:01,129
And totally delicious.

18
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,092
Uh, you guys don't mind?

19
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,404
Oh! Uh, of course.

20
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:09,120
I just came by to see if you hadn't
any books on historical fashion.

21
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,432
Did you say "delicious"?

22
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:16,125
Sure did! Next week's my birthday.
And this is my birthday dinner.

23
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,170
Start with this one.

24
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:21,130
Thanks, Twilight.

25
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:22,637
I've got the feeling
ruffled taffeta capes...

26
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:24,833
...are going to make a huge
comeback this season.

27
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,151
And I want to be ahead of the game.

28
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:32,056
I hope it's as tasty
as it is beautiful, Spike.

29
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:36,030
I've never seen anything
quite so stunning before.

30
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,431
Gosh. You really like it, huh?

31
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:43,794
Like it?

32
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:47,124
It's magnificent!

33
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,293
Then you should have it.

34
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,630
This beautiful gem was
meant to to be with you.

35
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,041
I don't know what to say.

36
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,381
This is so thoughtful.

37
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,965
Mm, my little Spikey-wikey!

38
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,586
Thank you so much!

39
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:15,073
Wow, Spike.

40
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:18,238
That's one of the kindest, most
generous things you've ever done.

41
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,944
I've never seen Rarity so happy.

42
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:24,364
I will never wash this cheek again.

43
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,895
Just about finished, Spike?

44
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:39,463
Everypony will be here soon.

45
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,882
There. Perfect.

46
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:43,709
Everything looks perfect.

47
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,807
Not quite everything.

48
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:48,931
A wash cloth? I don't get it.

49
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:53,403
Oh, no way, Twilight!

50
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:56,991
I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek
that Rarity kissed and I meant it!

51
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:04,895
It's over, Spike!
I'm cleaning that cheek!

52
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:09,975
It's mine!

53
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,574
-Stop it!
-Never!

54
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,306
Happy birthday!

55
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:26,332
Party time, woohoo!

56
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:28,677
Are those... for me?

57
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:31,105
You bet they are, birthday boy.

58
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:33,226
Happy birthday, Spike.

59
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:45,027
Don't you know you get
presents on your birthday?

60
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:49,133
Well, actually this is my first
birthday in Ponyville.

61
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:51,616
I usually just get one present.

62
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:54,420
From Twilight. A book.

63
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:02,580
Speaking of presents, this is
from my new line of taffeta capes.

64
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:05,037
I'm going to make one for each of you.

65
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:11,185
I've been inspired by the generosity
of my little Spikey-wikey...

66
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,683
...who gave me this
beautiful fire ruby...

67
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:16,332
...one of the kindest acts
I've ever experienced.

68
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,912
Applejack, I can't thank you
enough for this great blanket.

69
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:29,900
I really needed a new one.

70
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:33,210
Come on, Spike. You already
thanked me fifteen times.

71
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:35,313
I'm starting to get a little embarrassed.

72
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:38,160
I know I keep thanking you guys,
but I'm just so grateful.

73
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:41,055
I wish this party could last forever.

74
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:42,540
Duh!

75
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,529
Party can't last forever, cause
you have to go to Sugarcube Corner...

76
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,013
...cause the Cakes said they have
a special surprise for you...

77
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,617
...CAUSE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!

78
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:51,352
NO WAY!

79
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:53,972
I said the party can't last forever...

80
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:56,458
...but it doesn't need to end right now!

81
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:01,108
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cake!

82
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:04,860
There's the dragon of the hour!
Happy birthday, Spike!

83
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:05,855
Thanks.

84
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,823
When we found out
it was your birthday...

85
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:10,654
...we couldn't resist
trying out a new recipe.

86
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:12,316
Sapphire!

87
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:15,435
Wow!

88
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,783
Thank you so much!

89
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:23,109
Man! First I get a bunch of great
presents from my best friends...

90
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,669
...and now an amazing sapphire cupcake!

91
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,273
Ho ho, what a day!

92
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:39,342
Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee.

93
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,847
That's okay. What's got you so excited?

94
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:49,723
Pinkie Pie told me I should
come to the Cakes...

95
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:52,139
...so they could give me a treat,
cause it's my birthday today.

96
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,978
Why, happy birthday, Spike!

97
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,942
I wish I had something to give you.

98
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:57,808
Oh!

99
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,403
Here you go.

100
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:02,922
Wow. Really?

101
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,171
Sure. Everypony should get
fun gifts on their birthday.

102
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:11,049
Have a great birthday, Spike.

103
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,825
I wish every day was my birthday.

104
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:18,974
Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday
to the Cakes and I get a cupcake.

105
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:22,852
I mention it to Cheerilee
and I get this great hat.

106
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,913
I wonder...

107
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,405
Hey there, Lickety Split! That's
a pretty cool ball you got there!

108
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:41,823
Did you know it's my birthday?

109
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,287
This in unbelievable!

110
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:55,003
Hey, Junebug! It's my birthday!

111
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:58,855
Uh... Happy birthday, Spike.

112
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,054
Aren't you gonna give me something?

113
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:02,939
You know, like a birthday present?

114
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,900
Um... I... I don't have anything.

115
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,993
Well, how about those
flowers? I'll take those.

116
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,301
Spike!

117
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:12,715
Sorry, Junebug.

118
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:15,653
I think Spike might have
gotten a little carried away.

119
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,680
Uh... No problem.

120
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,557
Happy birthday, Spike!

121
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:23,624
What are you doing? You're
out here demanding gifts now?

122
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,616
Wow. You're right, Twilight.

123
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,220
I don't know what got into me.

124
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:30,987
Thanks for snapping me out of it.

125
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,089
I'd better go give
Cheerilee her hat back.

126
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:37,718
No problem. See you at home later?

127
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:40,068
Sounds good. Bye!

128
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:48,611
Who else has a present for Spikey-wikey?

129
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,960
Wow. Little rough night sleep, Spike.

130
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,118
I had the weirdest drea...

131
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:09,446
I can't believe you!
Where'd you get all this...?

132
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,373
What happened?

133
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,825
What's happening to me, Twilight?!

134
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:27,386
I don't know! Think back to last night.

135
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:29,063
Did something happen?

136
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:37,619
Spike.

137
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:40,681
What did you do after I saw you?

138
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:43,774
I went to talk to...

139
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:46,213
Spike!

140
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:51,021
You went to talk to who?

141
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,595
Oh, um... I don't remember.

142
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:56,132
Hey, can I have that globe?
You're not using it, right?

143
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,170
Huh?

144
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:02,171
What about this book?

145
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,688
Spike, I'm worried about you.

146
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,548
You're usually not so... grabby.

147
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,689
My arms aren't usually
THIS LONG EITHER.

148
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,229
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

149
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:30,785
Well now, what theems to be the problem?

150
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,391
This is Spike...

151
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:34,920
...and something's wrong with him.

152
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,698
He used to be half this size.

153
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:39,850
And he keeps trying to take
things that aren't... his.

154
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:44,219
All right then. Let'th just
have a look-thee, shall we?

155
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:47,783
Wittle guy not feewing too good?

156
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:52,729
Who's the brave wittle boy, huh?
Who's the brave one?

157
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,756
So? What do you think, doctor?

158
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:02,456
Well, I think I know
what the problem is.

159
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,032
He is... a dragon!

160
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:08,437
That's not the problem.
He's always been a dragon.

161
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,425
Oh. Well, that would explain it.

162
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,841
Listen, I don't know
anything about dragons.

163
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:16,216
I know about baby ponies.
Maybe you should try a vet.

164
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:20,209
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

165
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:23,049
Well, I'm flummoxed.

166
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,242
You bring me a dog – I've
got it diagnosed in seconds.

167
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,455
Snake even faster. But to be honest...

168
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:30,146
...I've never seen
a real-life dragon before.

169
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:35,428
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

170
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,030
Set.

171
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,691
Thanks anyway.

172
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,590
Come on, Spike.

173
00:11:59,347 --> 00:11:59,925
Ooh.

174
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,616
He is starting to mature.

175
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:03,861
Of this fact I am quite sure.

176
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:07,061
Mature? So he's just... growing up?

177
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:10,164
But that doesn't explain
why he keeps grabbing things.

178
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,459
A dragon's heart is prone to greed.

179
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,315
A steady diet to make growth speed.

180
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:20,680
Then the resulting bigger size
only makes their hunger rise.

181
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:24,413
If this trait should go unchecked,
if Spike continues to collect...

182
00:12:24,414 --> 00:12:27,032
...more growth will certainly occur.

183
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:29,607
He is going to turn into a monster.

184
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,359
You mean...

185
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,959
...the more things the dragon collects,
the bigger and greedier he gets?

186
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,051
But how do we stop him before
he's completely out of control?

187
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:40,896
If his monstrous ways
you wish to impede...

188
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:44,290
...you must prevent him
from practicing greed.

189
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,114
Get away from her, you brute!

190
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:57,127
SPIKE WANT!

191
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,815
You're not getting my scooter!

192
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:02,349
SPIKE WANT!

193
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,413
Hey, Spike!

194
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:09,200
Check out this amazing broom.

195
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:15,090
SPIKE WAAANT!!!

196
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,427
Come on, big boy.
Look at this incredible broom.

197
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:33,689
SPIKE WANT!

198
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:39,474
Fight all you want.
I'm not letting you out.

199
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,922
Ugh, Spike.
I just reshelved this room.

200
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,772
What now?

201
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,503
Now who in Ponyville
would steal my apples?

202
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,991
For that matter, who
would steal my leaves?

203
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:13,083
Applejack, help!

204
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,560
Spike's running wild and
I need you to lasso him!

205
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:20,523
Oh, that's a good one, Twilight.

206
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,819
Sweet little Spike running wild.

207
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:24,184
What a laugh.

208
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:29,977
Twilight, get my rope.

209
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:45,458
HEEELP!

210
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:47,359
Huh?

211
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:55,825
Don't tell me you...
you tied yourselves up?

212
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:57,576
Get us out of here right now!

213
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:00,927
What was that?

214
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:03,360
Sounded like Fluttershy to me.

215
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:05,900
Fluttershy? Fluttershy!

216
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:08,108
I'm up here!

217
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,578
What happened?

218
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,954
I was helping my squirrel friends
with their dance step...

219
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:19,721
...and all of a sudden a giant
rampaging d-d-dragon stormed through.

220
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,347
That was Spike!

221
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:25,541
Spike?! But why would Spike
steal my chicken coop?

222
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,949
He just pulled it out of the ground...

223
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,375
...and filled it with a bunch
of apples and stuff...

224
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,782
That sounded like Pinkie Pie!

225
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:34,261
Come on, girls!

226
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:36,487
Back! Get back!

227
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:45,790
Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!

228
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,842
I'm not giving him cake!
I'm assaulting him with cake!

229
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,379
How dare you take the cake?!

230
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:09,034
He's completely out of control.
Who knows where he'll go next?

231
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:15,478
Perhaps some more ruffle.

232
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:50,480
Put me down, you brute!

233
00:16:54,755 --> 00:16:56,704
How rude.

234
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:59,231
Don't worry, Rarity. We'll save you.

235
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:01,799
Put her down right now!

236
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,253
I-If you wouldn't mind, that is.

237
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:06,843
I mean it, dragon boy!

238
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:10,247
We'd be ever so grateful if you'd be
so kind as to possibly consider...

239
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:12,502
Drop her, scaly!

240
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,029
Hey!

241
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:18,772
I'm... not some...
sort of common... flyswattaaah!

242
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:27,316
Girls!

243
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,025
My cape!

244
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,067
Look! The Wonderbolts!

245
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,046
Oh, be quiet.

246
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:25,375
You've got nothing to be proud of.

247
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:27,836
You steal everypony's things,
terrorize the town...

248
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:30,426
...and use me as a weapon
against my own friends.

249
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:32,996
Which as horrible as it is,
I can almost understand...

250
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:34,816
...because you're a dragon and all.

251
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:36,262
BUT THIS...

252
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:41,411
THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST FASHION!

253
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:52,625
Oh no! You are not
getting this gemstone!

254
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:57,588
This was given to me
by my dear friend Spikey-wikey.

255
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:01,222
The kindest, sweetest,
most generous dragon ever.

256
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:05,544
And it is too precious to me to give
to a greedy old beast like you!

257
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:14,737
"Here, Rarity. You take it."

258
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:19,324
"It would mean even more to see
you happy, than to eat it myself."

259
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,399
"I... I don't know what to say..."

260
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,965
"This is just so generous..."

261
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:37,161
Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be
eating me or something.

262
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:43,238
Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?!

263
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,883
Somepony do something!

264
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,257
On it!

265
00:19:56,229 --> 00:20:00,561
Rarity, I need to tell you something.
Just in case we don't make it.

266
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,570
I've always sort of had a crush...

267
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,196
We did it! I can't believe we did it!

268
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,466
All in a day's work.

269
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:43,784
Spike, I just have to tell you how
absolutely proud I am of you.

270
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:46,203
Proud of me?

271
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:51,986
Yes. It was you, who stopped...
you from destroying Ponyville.

272
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:54,942
You are my hero, Spikey-wikey.

273
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:03,956
"Dear Princess Celestia."

274
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,703
"Today I learned a great
lesson about friendship."

275
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:11,135
"Well, you might think that it would feel
good to get lots and lots of stuff..."

276
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,021
"...but it doesn't feel nearly as great
as giving something special..."

277
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,356
"...to somepony you really care about."

278
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:20,105
"Why, I learned that it truly
is better to give than to receive..."

279
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,441
"...and that kindness and generosity
are what lead to true friendship."

280
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:27,823
"And that's more valuable
than anything in the world."

281
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:31,520
Well, almost anything.

282
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:36,439
