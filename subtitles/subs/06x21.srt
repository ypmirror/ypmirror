1
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:14,205
I've prepared a
full day of spells.

2
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,594
You've been doing great,

3
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:18,257
but now it's time
for a real challenge.

4
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:22,548
Oh, it is on. Where
do we begin?

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,794
Teleportation. Multiple
locations. Try to keep up.

6
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:44,405
Transfiguration!

7
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:56,954
SHIELDS!

8
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:22,445
Whoo! I am on FIRE!
What's next?

9
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:25,325
Maybe there is such a
thing as too much studying.

11
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:11,150
As you know, speed spells
like Accelero are not easy.

12
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,790
But if done correctly,
they can allow you to be

13
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:15,390
much more efficient
with your day.

14
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:22,529
Way to go,
Starlight!

15
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,833
Oh, I'm not finished. I've
discovered a very old spell,

16
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:29,772
Similo Duplexus.

17
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:33,144
When combined with Accelero
in just the right way...

18
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,009
...you can literally be
in two places at once!

19
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:44,744
NOW I'm finished.

20
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:48,252
I have to admit, your skills
with magic really are

21
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:51,698
nothing short of amazing.
I'm very impressed.

22
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:55,501
I've always been
something of a natural.

23
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,827
However, it doesn't
look like you've tackled

24
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,172
any friendship lessons
since you met Trixie.

25
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,286
Are you sure? I
could have sworn

26
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,243
there were a couple
in there somewhere.

27
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,058
I'm sure.

28
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:12,455
I see. Well, I'm really
quite busy this week...

29
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:16,196
so many commitments! I'll try
and find some time in my --

30
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,735
No time like
the present!

31
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,624
Spike and I are
headed to Canterlot.

32
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:21,729
Princess Celestia wanted
me to give her students

33
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,083
a quick overview
on the history

34
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,640
of enchanted objects
in Equestria.

35
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:27,243
We'll be back after the
presentation, which should be-

36
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,040
20 moons from now?

37
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:32,153
Tonight. It's a
quick presentation.

38
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,904
Sure. Keep tellin'
yourself that.

39
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,286
You can tackle a
friendship lesson today

40
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:38,547
and we can review
your progress

41
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:40,104
when I get back
later this evening.

42
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:45,891
Of course! No problem.
Friendship lesson. On it!

43
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:47,956
Great! Can't wait!

44
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:50,332
Now Spike, help me
color code these cards

45
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,523
according to time,
place and object.

46
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:06,713
Huh? Oh.

47
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:11,895
Hey! Twilight and I are
about to head to Canterlot.

48
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:14,516
Just checking to see if you
need anything before we left.

49
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:15,840
Nope! Not at all!

50
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,489
I'm good here. Not
good. Great.

51
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,107
Not a problem in
the world.

52
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,440
Uh-huh.

53
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,363
So... what are
you doing exactly?

54
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:29,581
I was... just trying to decide
which friendship lesson

55
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:32,147
I was going to tackle while
you two were in Canterlot!

56
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:36,756
Oh, yup. Right here. Where I
just left them a second ago!

57
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:41,735
Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie,
scrapbook with Applejack,

58
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:43,495
sew with Rarity...

59
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:44,486
Uh.

60
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,756
Help an animal with Fluttershy,

61
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:51,218
chillax with Rainbow
Dash? What is chillaxing?

62
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:53,249
No idea.

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,098
You know, uh, if
you're nervous about

64
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:59,396
your friendship lessons,
it's totally okay to say so.

65
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:04,596
NERVOUS?! ME!
HAHAHA. Oh Spike.

66
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:08,375
You really are hilarious.
You think I'm nervous

67
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,784
that I'm going to
fail something

68
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:12,301
as simple as baking
a cake?

69
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:14,172
Well, if you were,
it would be--

70
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:17,372
Silly! Twilight just said
how impressed she was

71
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:20,061
that I combined a speed spell
and a duplication spell.

72
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:23,372
THAT was a challenge.
These? Ha!

73
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:26,227
I could combine all five
of these at the same time

74
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,196
without breaking a sweat!

75
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:29,692
I think maybe you're missing--

76
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:32,073
An opportunity to
really impress Twilight?

77
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:35,932
Great idea, Spike! I'm gonna
get right on that. Good talk!

78
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,381
And I thought Twilight was
the master of the freakout.

79
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,378
So, with your help,
I figure

80
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,978
these should be
done in no time!

81
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,433
Are you sure this is what
Twilight would want?

82
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:49,723
Seems like you might
wanna take your time

83
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,689
with each of these.

84
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,356
But by working as a team,
we can get them done faster.

85
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:57,507
And isn't teamwork a key
factor in friendship?

86
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,480
I guess.

87
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:03,113
Super! Pinkie Pie,
since we're baking,

88
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,264
you will be in
the kitchen.

89
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,981
Rarity, Applejack you two
can set up in the library.

90
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,350
Oh, I don't know that
the dusty old library

91
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:11,612
has the proper lighting.

92
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:13,747
Perhaps we can stay
out here in the foyer?

93
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,116
I thought that Fluttershy and
I could work with the animals

94
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,187
right here in the foyer.

95
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,760
Oh, um, whatever
you think is best.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,907
Great. Now, Rainbow Dash--

97
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,563
<i>But it might depend</i>
<i> on the animal.</i>

98
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:26,547
For instance, this poor little
eagle with a sprained wing

99
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:28,855
might be better off up
in one of the towers.

100
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:29,926
Yeah, yeah, yeah sure.

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,175
And these adorable chipmunks
might prefer a nook somewhere.

102
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,372
Maybe if you spent
some time getting to-

103
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:36,553
In a minute, Fluttershy.

104
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:40,972
Uh, I don't know if we
can chillax properly

105
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:44,184
in the castle. We need
very specific conditions

106
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:45,766
for optimal chillaxing.

107
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:49,415
Oh. I just assumed chillaxing
could happen anywhere.

108
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,566
Ha. Shows what you know
about chillaxing.

109
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,203
Let me do some
location scouting.

110
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:58,264
O-kay. Uh, it seemed
more efficient to

111
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:00,264
start with the scrapbooking
so we could just get it out--

112
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,184
Oh! Oh! oh!
Can we start with me?

113
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,901
We're gonna need time for the
cake to bake! After all...

114
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:09,889
<i> ♪ It's a piece of cake</i>
<i> to bake a pretty cake-- ♪</i>

115
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:13,040
Uh, we're on a schedule.
No time for a song.

116
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,212
We can start with
baking. THEN--

117
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:17,249
But we can't design dresses
after you've been baking

118
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:20,178
with Pinkie. She
can be a bit messy.

119
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:28,436
Fine. We can start with
the dresses and THEN--

120
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,584
While y'all figure that out,
I'm gonna start layin out

121
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:31,796
the pictures for scrapbooking.

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,110
We've got a whole
lot of time to cover.

123
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:35,827
How much is a whole lot?

124
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:38,406
We've got at least 80
moons worth of memories

125
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,083
to go through!

126
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:40,836
80 moons!?

127
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,067
Ugh!

128
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:44,763
There is NOwhere to
chillax in this castle.

129
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:46,615
We're gonna have to
set up somewhere else!

130
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,750
Could you all excuse
me for one second?

131
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:59,655
Wow. That pony really
needs to chillax.

132
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:06,830
OK, Starlight.
You've got this.

133
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:08,572
A handful of friendship
lessons is nothing

134
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,849
compared to the spells
you've mastered.

135
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:16,430
Maybe if I cast a little
spell to help things along.

136
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:20,141
Something simple and
safe. Fiducia Compelus?

137
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,338
That's not bad. They
would barely notice it.

138
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:23,981
But is it enough?

139
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:28,947
Maybe Cogeria so they are
more open to suggestion?

140
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:33,360
Or maybe Cogeria combined
with Fiducia Compelus!

141
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:36,664
Yes... that could work nicely.

142
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:40,516
Oh, with a hint of Persuadere
to be sure it sticks.

143
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,280
Everypony will
probably thank me

144
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,040
for getting it all
done so quickly.

145
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,529
And Twilight will
be thrilled

146
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,707
I've completed so many
lessons. Everypony wins!

147
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,523
Congratulations Starlight,
you're a genius.

148
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:13,384
Maybe the congratulations
were a little premature.

149
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:26,233
Cogeria...
Persuadere...Fiducia...

150
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:31,316
Oh, of course! Fiducia
Compelus needs a trigger!

151
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,806
PONIES! HEAR MY
VOICE AND LISTEN.

152
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,286
Pinkie, kitchen. Rarity,
Applejack, library.

153
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,523
Fluttershy, stay here.

154
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,329
Rainbow Dash, find
somewhere INSIDE the castle

155
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:47,156
and set up a place
where we can chillax.

156
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:55,833
Let's get to work, Pinkie!

157
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,873
Okie-Dokie. What would
you like to do first?

158
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,470
Uh. What are we
supposed to do first?

159
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:05,015
Whatever you want to do
first, Starlight Glimmer.

160
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,544
In a medium-sized
mixing bowl,

161
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,873
beat together eggs, sugar and
two teaspoons of vanilla...

162
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:14,264
Mix in flour...

163
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:19,193
Add baking soda,
salt and cinnamon.

164
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:22,313
I think you can
take it from here.

165
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,123
Take what from where?

166
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:27,969
The baking. Just keep
following the instructions

167
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:29,156
in the book until I get back.

168
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:30,621
Absotively!

169
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,286
Instruction following starting... NOW!

170
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,735
Baking a cake, check!
Now on to sewing.

171
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:42,153
What did you have
in mind, Rarity?

172
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:45,575
Whatever you want me to have
in my mind, Starlight Glimmer.

173
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,581
Can you make a dress
exactly like that one?

174
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:55,993
JUST like this one?

175
00:10:56,313 --> 00:10:57,101
Just like it.

176
00:10:57,206 --> 00:11:00,067
Absolutely! It will
look perfectly divine!

177
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,963
That's a whole
lot of photos.

178
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,593
How do you usually
organize them?

179
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:10,732
However you want me to
organize them, Starlight.

180
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,310
Ok. Tell me
about this one.

181
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:16,344
Sweet Apple Acres.
20 moons ago.

182
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,138
Granny Smith was looking
for her favorite pie tin.

183
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:21,870
She looked in the kitchen,
but it wasn't there.

184
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:24,781
She looked in the barn,
but it wasn't there.

185
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:28,473
I don't need every
little detail.

186
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,726
Just sum up the story
in one sentence.

187
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:34,443
Huh. Turns out Granny
Smith didn't know

188
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,473
HOW to make a pig
do the backstroke.

189
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:41,107
Uh-huh. Why don't you
keep putting these photos

190
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,163
in chronological order
and when I come back

191
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:45,741
you can give me
more highlights.

192
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:49,003
Sure thing,
Starlight Glimmer.

193
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:53,255
Fluttershy? Where
are all the animals?

194
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:54,966
They ran away.

195
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,163
And why didn't
you stop them?

196
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,618
Because you
didn't ask me to.

197
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,341
Obviously I wanted
you to-- never mind.

198
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:06,320
Can you please round up all
the animals in the castle

199
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,932
and bring them back
here to the foyer.

200
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,233
All the animals. Got it.

201
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:14,320
Did you find a place to
chillax, Rainbow Dash?

202
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,560
Sure thing,
Starlight Glimmer.

203
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,498
Great. Let me know
when it's ready.

204
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:20,535
Yes, Starlight Glimmer!

205
00:12:24,184 --> 00:12:26,763
Granny Smith knew she was
gonna need a bigger boat.

206
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:29,895
So Goldie Delicious says, "If
you can't say anything nice

207
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,381
about anypony...
come sit by me!"

208
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:35,581
Big Mac knew if he just
covered himself in mud,

209
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,667
the creature wouldn't
be able to see him.

210
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:41,741
Starlight Glimmer!
I have finished the dress!

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,070
Isn't it gorgeous?

212
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:44,732
What is that?

213
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,104
You wanted me
to make a dress

214
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,753
exactly like the
one in the book.

215
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,735
Go make a REAL
dress out of fabric

216
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:53,470
exactly like the
one in the book.

217
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:57,396
Ahhhh. I see. Yes, of
course, Starlight Glimmer.

218
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,920
Rarity! Make it BIGGER
than the one in the book.

219
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,756
Of course, darling.
Bigger it is.

220
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:12,030
She was just a pony, standing
in front of another pony,

221
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:13,692
asking him to love her.

222
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,320
Pinkie, what are you doing?!

223
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,867
Following all of the
instructions in the cookbook

224
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,578
in order, Starlight Glimmer!

225
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:30,640
I meant just the ONE cake! I
was only gone a few minutes!

226
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,710
How in Equestria did you get
all of this done so fast?

227
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:36,147
First I combined
three eggs, then--

228
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:41,704
I think the baking
lesson is done.

229
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:44,264
Oh, what now?

230
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:52,843
They can take our farm, but
they can't take our freedom!

231
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,080
What's going on?

232
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:00,849
I've gathered all of the
animals like you asked,

233
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,153
Starlight Glimmer.

234
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:10,307
Oh yes, this will do
nicely. A MUCH bigger dress!

235
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,836
It was the best
of apples;

236
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,756
it was the worst
of apples.

237
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:20,178
I can handle this. It's just
magic and I know magic.

238
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,166
What's that?

239
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:27,323
What did you say?

240
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:31,378
The cakes are burning!
You left the ovens on!

241
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:33,335
We need water!

242
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,513
Yes, Starlight Glimmer.

243
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,015
Storm clouds?!

244
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,987
Big Mac told me, with
a whole lotta power

245
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,480
comes a heckuva lot
of responsibility.

246
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:05,513
This can't get any worse.

247
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,870
WHAT IS GOING ON!?

248
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,867
I had no idea we had
spiders in the castle.

249
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,701
I'm never sleeping again.

250
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:24,184
Maybe if I had reversed the
Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria.

251
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:26,800
Or maybe I added
too much Persuadere.

252
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:28,338
What?

253
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:31,040
You're really missing
the point here.

254
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:34,030
I finally untangled
that mess of a spell

255
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:37,661
and got everypony home. It
was really powerful stuff.

256
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,643
They're gonna feel
that in the morning.

257
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:42,196
Now, please try to
explain to me

258
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:43,686
how in the name
of Celestia

259
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:45,483
things got this
out of control?

260
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:49,169
Well, it was the first time
I cast that particular spell

261
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:50,758
and I didn't fully
think it through.

262
00:15:50,768 --> 00:15:51,857
I bet if I had reversed--

263
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:53,915
I think you might be
missing the point here.

264
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,111
Told ya.

265
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:57,168
What made you think
that casting a spell

266
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:58,608
on your friends
to do your bidding

267
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,524
was even remotely
a good idea?

268
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:04,635
Well, when you put it that
way, it sounds really bad.

269
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:06,871
That's because it
IS really bad!

270
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:07,768
Uh...

271
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:12,853
Starlight. I'm not mad at
you. But I am disappointed.

272
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:15,973
You've been doing so well.
I just don't understand

273
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,515
how a friendship lesson
turned into all of this?

274
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,422
Ugh. Fine!

275
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:23,977
I've been avoiding the
friendship lessons on purpose.

276
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:25,231
Why?

277
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,511
I can cast complex spells.

278
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:30,462
But baking a cake with
Pinkie Pie freaks me out.

279
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:33,435
And yes I know how
ridiculous that sounds.

280
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:35,022
That's why I didn't
say anything.

281
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:37,004
I thought if I just
kept wowing you

282
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:41,080
with my magical abilities,
you might just... not notice.

283
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:43,626
Baking a cake
freaks you out?

284
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:47,324
Yes! Baking a cake,
sewing. All of it.

285
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:49,306
What if I was
bad at it?

286
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:51,902
I didn't want to be a
disappointment to anypony

287
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:55,342
and I ended up being a
disappointment to everypony.

288
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:58,426
Starlight. Do you
think anypony cares

289
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,795
if you can bake a cake?

290
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,600
But the lesson--

291
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,768
Was to get to know
Pinkie Pie better

292
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:05,586
by doing something
she loves.

293
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,937
It was a friendship lesson,
not a baking lesson.

294
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:12,284
Oh. You know I think I might
have missed the point here.

295
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:13,480
Told ya.

296
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:14,995
So now what?

297
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:18,146
Now it's time for a pretty
advanced friendship lesson.

298
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:20,351
It's called apologizing.

299
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:28,711
I dunno what kinda whammy
Starlight put on us,

300
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:31,040
but I feel like I got
shoved through the

301
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,048
Super Speedy Cider
Squeezy 6000™.

302
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,577
Ugh! Tell me about it.

303
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:40,475
If everypony could speak in a
whisper for the next few days,

304
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:44,337
that would be delightful.
My head is thumping.

305
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,342
I was up all night
calming the animals down.

306
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:50,351
Fluttershy, please!
Not so loud.

307
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,373
Starlight's spell made me
burn perfectly good cake!

308
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,551
I NEVER burn cake!

309
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,920
<i>Yeah, about that...</i>

310
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:00,600
Things got a little
out of hand last night.

311
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:03,440
Ain't that the
understatement of the day?

312
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:06,217
Tell it to the cakes, sister!

313
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:10,795
Can we all PLEASE argue
at a lower volume?

314
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:13,080
I really messed up.

315
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:16,746
I cast the spell because I was
nervous about working with you

316
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,186
on the friendship lessons.

317
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:21,075
Well, here's a friendship
lesson for you.

318
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:24,595
Don't cast spells
on your friends!

319
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:27,222
Believe me; I know.

320
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:30,408
What I did was wrong and
I can't take it back.

321
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:33,880
You're right to be upset
and I hope one day,

322
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:39,382
I can make it up to you. But
all I can say is I'm sorry.

323
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:43,604
Now if you'll excuse me, I've
got to go clean the castle

324
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,475
covered in wet cake
batter and spiders.

325
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:49,577
That was a pretty
good apology.

326
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,780
Seems like she
feels really bad.

327
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:55,768
Hey, Starlight! Most of
the Apple family photos

328
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,391
are still laying
around in the wreckage.

329
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:59,444
I think I'll come along
and hunt 'em down.

330
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:02,688
Oh! And I feel awful for
disturbing all of those

331
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,648
cute little spiders and
bats. I should check on them.

332
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:08,977
Ah, yes. And I left
some lovely fabric out;

333
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,942
I should come move it to
that nice quiet library.

334
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:15,040
Uh, I'll come and get
those storm clouds

335
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:15,982
out of the bathroom.

336
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:19,466
Fine! Somepony has to
bake a cake to honor

337
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:22,333
all of the poor cakes that
sacrificed their batter

338
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:24,355
in last night's tragedy.

339
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,564
It seems your
apology went well.

340
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:19,546
I'm just lucky to have
such understanding friends.

341
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:21,315
But it's probably
going to be a while

342
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:24,013
before I try to tackle those
friendship lessons again.

343
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:27,022
What do you mean? You've
been doing them all day!

344
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,826
What are you
talking about?

345
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,520
I've been cleaning
up the mess I made

346
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:32,320
by totally failing
at friendship.

347
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,768
Really? But didn't I see
you sewing with Rarity?

348
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:37,062
Yes but--

349
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,337
And you and Applejack did
a great job collecting

350
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,164
those photos and putting
them in the book.

351
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,057
Helping animals with Fluttershy,

352
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,617
baking with Pinkie Pie.

353
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:46,591
Those sound like your
assignments to me.

354
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,071
In fact, I think there's just
one that you're missing.

355
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:53,484
Sun? Check. Chairs? Check.

356
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:56,080
And thanks to a simple
catadupa levitata spell,

357
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:59,128
we've got water! Is that
everything we need to chillax?

358
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:00,808
Nope.

359
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,631
No? What did I miss?

360
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,057
Quiet.

361
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:06,608
Ah. Right.

362
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:08,582
Great job, Starlight.

363
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:11,235
Looks like you've completed
another friendship lesson.

364
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,902
Hey! She completes the lesson
when I say she completes it.

365
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:21,040
So less learning
and more chillaxing!

366
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,804
So, how long do we
sit quietly?
