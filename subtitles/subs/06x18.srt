1
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:20,960
Hey, Applejack.
Whatchya doin'?

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,938
Well, I was practicin'
my distance buckin'.

3
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,864
Distance bucking? What for?

4
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,476
Because Cousin Braeburn and
the rest of the Apple Family

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,206
in Appleoosa seem to think

6
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:38,190
that their team can beat
Ponyville at Buckball.

7
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:46,830
WHAT? Ha! That's ridiculous!
Nopony beats Ponyville!

8
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:50,110
I mean, I could beat the whole
town of Appleoosa at Buckball

9
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:52,418
with one wing tied
behind my back.

10
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:02,461
So I can count on you to join
the Ponyville Buckball team?

11
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:07,066
Oh, yeah! I am so there.
I've just got one question.

12
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:08,178
Mm?

13
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,935
Uh, what's Buckball?

14
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:24,840

https://yp1.yayponies.no/

15
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:56,578
So basically, Buckball
is the coolest game ever.

16
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,775
Offense! Defense!
Teamwork. Non-stop action.

17
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:02,381
It's got it all!

18
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:05,772
Wow, Rainbow Dash. You
sure seem to know a lot

19
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:10,006
about this game. I've never
even heard of Buckball.

20
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:12,436
Yeah. I'm kind of an expert.

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,101
Hah, an expert who hadn't
heard of the game either

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,160
until I told you.

23
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,778
Well, it's a
new game.

24
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,993
I probably know more
than most ponies

25
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:21,796
so that makes me
an expert.

26
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:24,283
I don't know anything
about it at all.

27
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:26,110
But it sounds like there's
a ball and bucking,

28
00:02:26,172 --> 00:02:28,609
so I'm betting it's
super-duper fun.

29
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:31,021
The point is my
cousin Braeburn

30
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,732
somehow convinced
a Pegasus

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,270
and a unicorn to
come play

32
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:35,932
with him on the
Appleoosa team.

33
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:38,535
And he can't stop bragging
about how his team

34
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:40,227
is gonna beat ours.

35
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:43,150
But, um, we don't
have a team.

36
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,144
Well, between Applejack and me,

37
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,584
we've got two
thirds of a team.

38
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:48,209
All we need is
a unicorn.

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,067
That's where you
two come in.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,458
Uh, they know we're
not unicorns, right?

41
00:02:55,723 --> 00:03:00,135
Uh, obviously. You're
gonna be on my team

42
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,756
and Fluttershy is gonna
be on Applejack's team.

43
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,000
We'll play against each other,
along with whatever unicorns

44
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:08,344
wanna try out until
we find the best one.

45
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,338
Oooohhhhhh! Phew,
that's a relief

46
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,120
because I left my
unicorn costume at home.

47
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:21,901
I know a lot of you are
here because I told you

48
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:24,332
what an amazing
game Buckball is.

49
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:27,495
And even though it's already
an Apple Family favorite,

50
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:30,160
most of you probably don't
know anything about it.

51
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,516
So I thought we'd give
you a quick demonstration.

52
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:36,916
The two earth ponies
are on offense.

53
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:39,833
They meet in the middle of
the field for the buck off.

54
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:42,418
They both try to be the
first one to kick it.

55
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:48,984
And the Pegasus is on defense.

56
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:51,520
She tries to keep the ball
from going in the goal

57
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:54,578
and passes it back to the
earth pony on her team.

58
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:56,461
Just give it a
little kick, Pinkie.

59
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,132
Oooh! I get it!

60
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,689
And all the unicorns have to
do is float these here baskets

61
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,123
around the outside
of the field

62
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,009
and catch as many balls as
possible for their team.

63
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:12,652
You two get
the idea?

64
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,424
Absolutely!

65
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,129
Oh, I don't know. That
ball moves pretty fast.

66
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:23,052
All right. Now let's see which
of you has what it takes.

67
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:31,827
Um...what do I do?

68
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:35,747
When the ball comes
towards you... catch it.

69
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:42,455
OK, just try your best, Pinkie.

70
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,947
I have been doing this
a lot longer than you.

71
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,369
HA-uhh.

72
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:47,987
Nice kick.

73
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:54,092
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whee! Haha!

74
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:55,495
Great save, Fluttershy!

75
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:00,196
Coming your way, Pinkie!

76
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,190
Somersault, kick!

77
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:10,363
Hey, this game is easy!

78
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:13,390
Oh, it actually is
kind of fun.

79
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:16,793
Where did Pinkie Pie
learn to buck like that?

80
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:21,132
And Fluttershy's spinning
tail catch is pretty amazing!

81
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,790
Um... OK, well let's see
what the rest of you can do.

82
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:31,538
Now, don't expect to be able
to beat me twice in a row.

83
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:36,252
Well, hello there
Mr. Ball. Whee!

84
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:38,972
Hiyah!

85
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,695
Hurry along, butterflies,

86
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:44,492
before that ball
comes and hits you.

87
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:52,418
Nope. Um. OK, let's see
what the rest of you can do.

88
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:55,126
Nope.

89
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:57,772
Definitely, not.

90
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:01,120
Noooo.

91
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:03,803
Not a chance.

92
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:05,630
No.

93
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:06,756
Nope.

94
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:14,172
And...no. Uh, this didn't
go how I thought it would.

95
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,821
It sure didn't.

96
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,673
This game is a
whole lot more fun

97
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,046
than I thought
it would be.

98
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,446
It's exactly as much fun
as I thought it would be...

99
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:27,144
A WHOLE BUNCH!

100
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:31,550
Carrying my water,
my water, my water.

101
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:35,316
Carrying my water
on my shoulder pole.

102
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:38,344
SNAILS, LOOK OUT!

103
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,486
Amazing!

104
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:46,966
You should be more
careful with these.

105
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,350
You could lose them.

106
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:55,120
Hey, Snails? Can you float one
of those baskets over here?

107
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:56,953
Sure.

108
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:58,578
What do you want
me to do with it?

109
00:06:59,058 --> 00:06:59,815
CATCH!

110
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:05,673
Anything else?

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,726
Wow, Snails, you're a
natural at Buckball.

112
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:14,178
It's a good thing, too. We
were running out of unicorns.

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,098
Do you think you'll be
ready to play with Applejack

114
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,338
and Rainbow Dash against
the Appleoosa team?

115
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:21,932
I guess I'll find out. Plus,
after I deliver this water,

116
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,784
I don't really have
anything else to do.

117
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,652
Well, Snails, with
you on the team,

118
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:31,046
Ponyville is one step closer
to crushing Appleoosa.

119
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:33,969
And after today,
it's pretty clear

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,692
who the other two
players should be.

121
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,116
What do you mean?

122
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:40,233
I thought you and Dash
were going to play.

123
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:44,209
Yeah. If you're not
crushing Appleoosa, who is?

124
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:49,446
Uh you two, obviously.

125
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,455
Um, you want us to
play Buckball

126
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:02,855
against Appleoosa
instead of you?

127
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:03,938
Mm hm.

128
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:06,640
That's un-credible.

129
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:12,240
Unbelievable and
incredible? Come on.

130
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,421
I can't explain it, but
you two are really good

131
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:18,252
at this game and if it
means beating Appleoosa,

132
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:20,375
I'll give either one of
you my spot on the team

133
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:22,504
quicker than Granny
Smith can core an apple.

134
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,627
Me too. I'd normally be so
pumped all of Ponyville

135
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:27,661
was counting on me to win,

136
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,464
I'd run right over
the competition,

137
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,012
but you still flew
rings around me.

138
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:35,612
Oh, I'm sorry. I
was just having fun.

139
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,307
Well, you can have all the
fun you want as long as it's

140
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:41,095
while you're beatin' the
hide off of Braeburn's team.

141
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,575
I do like fun.

142
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,492
Honestly, the game was
a little scary at first,

143
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:49,846
but once I got the hang of
it, I had a pretty good time.

144
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:53,107
Let's get this
party started!

145
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,541
All right, but if we really
wanna beat Appleoosa,

146
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:58,633
we're gonna have
to get serious.

147
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:00,646
Serious?

148
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:03,593
Serious how?

149
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:07,267
With serious practice!

150
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:12,424
Wow. This looks
pretty intense.

151
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,036
Well, duh. You two are
gonna be representing

152
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:19,870
all of Ponyville, and
more importantly...Us!

153
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,836
That's why before we leave
for Appleoosa tomorrow,

154
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:25,889
you two are gonna practice
just as hard as we would.

155
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,901
So, let's hop to it.

156
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,473
Snails already has
a head start on you!

157
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,132
OK. If you wanna win,

158
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:41,236
you've totally gotta
get this drill down.

159
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,800
I-I-I do?

160
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:03,827
It's all about ball control.

161
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,492
Ready? GO!

162
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:13,809
Come on! Faster! You don't
want Ponyville to lose

163
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,889
because you can't get
into high gear, do you?

164
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:17,033
Whoaaa.

165
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,486
All right, being able to
buck a ball into a goal

166
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,606
from any direction is the most
important thing in the game.

167
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,233
If you say so.

168
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,513
WHEEE! WOOO!

169
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:55,606
Keep it up! Just one miss'll
ruin the Apple Family's

170
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:57,538
Buckball reputation forever.

171
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,120
WHOA--What?

172
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:07,206
Whoops.

173
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,304
Come on! Push. Push! PUSH!

174
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,061
Come on now! Every shot
is for Sweet Apple Acres.

175
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:18,713
And me! And Dash!
And all of Ponyville!

176
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,169
Whoa. Ow.

177
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:22,701
Faster!

178
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:23,581
Whoa.

179
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:25,212
C'mon, now!

180
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:27,360
Whooaaa!

181
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:28,978
C'mon!

182
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:31,852
Keep it up!

183
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,544
Whooaaa!

184
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:34,455
C'MON!

185
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:45,489
What in the apple
happened to those two?

186
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:49,175
I don't know! They mopped
the field with us before.

187
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,741
All right! That's
it for today, y'all!

188
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:58,732
I thought practice was
supposed to make us better.

189
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:01,593
Maybe we just need
a little rest.

190
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:03,901
Or a whole lot of it.

191
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:07,378
Just be sure to get your heads
in the game before tomorrow.

192
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,815
All of Ponyville is
counting on a win.

193
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:19,101
I really don't want to let

194
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:22,406
Applejack and Rainbow Dash
down, or anypony else,

195
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:26,763
but after that practice, I'm
not feeling very confident.

196
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,107
Maybe we weren't that bad.

197
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,196
I guess I was hoping you
saw something I didn't.

198
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,160
I know our friends
want us to win,

199
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,541
but how can the whole
town be counting on us

200
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,818
if most ponies have never
even heard of Buckball?

201
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:43,889
I know! How can we
disappoint a pony

202
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,772
who doesn't even
know we have a team?

203
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:48,190
Or that we're going
to play Appleoosa.

204
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,015
Yeah, I don't think
we need to worry.

205
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:53,156
I'd be surprised
if anypony in this town

206
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,126
cares about this game at all.

207
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:02,836
Go Ponyville! Go
Ponyville! WIN! WIN! WIN!

208
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,233
Ponyville, Ponyville!
Way to go! You can do it!

209
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:09,421
Whoa. The whole
town really seems

210
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:11,501
to care about
this game a lot.

211
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:23,168
Woo-hoo, go Ponyville!

212
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:34,633
We kinda went around town and
talked up the team a little.

213
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,033
Yep. We wanted to
make sure you two knew

214
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,261
that all of Ponyville
was behind you.

215
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,270
Greaaaaat.

216
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,972
I hear the whole town's
already planning a parade

217
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:47,070
for when you get back
after whoopin' Appleoosa.

218
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:48,726
That should feel pretty good.

219
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:50,603
It should?

220
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:54,006
Totally! Just spend the
whole ride to Appleoosa

221
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:55,846
thinking about
everypony cheering

222
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:58,412
for the victorious
Ponyville Buckball Team.

223
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:02,043
I bet Princess Celestia even
comes to congratulate you.

224
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:05,932
If that doesn't get you in the
zone, I don't know what will.

225
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:11,778
I don't know what zone Rainbow
Dash is talking about,

226
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:15,206
but I'm pretty sure I don't
want to be in it. Do you?

227
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,473
Hey, you two are supposed
to be in the zone.

228
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,624
You see... The thing is...
Thinking about everpony...

229
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:31,390
thinking about us...
there's just no way...

230
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,012
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
WE CAN GET IN THE ZONE

231
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,227
BECAUSE THE ZONE SOUNDS
LIKE A HORRIBLE PLACE

232
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:38,030
SINCE WE ARE
TERRIBLE AT BUCKBALL

233
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,929
AND WE ARE GOING TO LOSE
AND LET EVERYPONY DOWN

234
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:43,655
AND WE DON'T WANT
TO PLAY ANYMORE!

235
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:51,181
I'm still OK with playing,
in case you were worried.

236
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,886
I don't get it.
They're naturals.

237
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,861
Why wouldn't they
want to play anymore?

238
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:02,443
Maybe us telling them how much
everypony was counting on them

239
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:03,840
messed them up somehow.

240
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:05,975
What? That's crazy talk.

241
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:09,280
Having ponies depend on you
is exactly what you need

242
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:10,369
to focus and...

243
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,080
Get serious and play hard and...

244
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:15,070
Get ready to totally smash
the competition and...

245
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,756
And none of that sounds like
Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?

246
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,704
Guess not.

247
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:26,873
We got so wrapped up in
what's important to us,

248
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:29,661
we went and ruined what was
fun about the game for them.

249
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,255
What do we do now?

250
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,766
Pinkie? Fluttershy?

251
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,163
We know you're in here.

252
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:45,766
We've looked in every
other car on the train.

253
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,110
Maybe you need
to look again.

254
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:51,796
Yeah. Because we're totally
not in here.

255
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,178
And we're definitely
not in here

256
00:15:54,313 --> 00:15:56,898
if you're going to try and make
us play against Appleoosa.

257
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:58,886
Or anypony else!

258
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,058
Oh, we're sorry
to let you down,

259
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:04,572
but it's better
to do it now

260
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,603
than during the game
against Appleoosa.

261
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:09,778
You don't have to play
against Appleoosa.

262
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,987
We don't?

263
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,775
Nope. We're gonna
take your place,

264
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,249
so you don't have to
worry about that at all.

265
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:20,190
Why didn't you say so?

266
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:23,889
But.... We can't take on
Braeburn and his team

267
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,766
without any practice

268
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:28,553
so we need you to play
just one more time...

269
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,018
Against us.

270
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,313
Now I know we mixed
up the teams before,

271
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:39,181
but since Dash and I
really need the practice,

272
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:40,867
we'll play against
the two of you.

273
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,089
Oh, I don't know how much
practice you'll get

274
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,449
against us. We've been
playing just awful.

275
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,160
Don't worry about it.

276
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,947
Applejack and I just
need a little workout.

277
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,587
Yep. You two just
do your best.

278
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,316
I can do that.

279
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:06,867
Oooooh!

280
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,310
Ooooh!

281
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,867
Looks like you two
really do need practice.

282
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,160
Wheee!

283
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:16,504
If you need more practice,
we can keep going.

284
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:19,686
Yeah. I could do
this all day.

285
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:22,172
Uh, no thanks.

286
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:25,396
Playing against you two
is just as humiliating now

287
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,532
as it was when we weren't
trying to show you

288
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,867
how awesome you are.

289
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:31,778
Wait. What?

290
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,218
Finally!

291
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,507
You must have noticed how
you aren't bad anymore.

292
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,621
Oooh yeah. Weird.

293
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:46,443
But um, why were we
so terrible before?

294
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,193
I guess some ponies
thrive on pressure

295
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:50,818
and some ponies don't.

296
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:53,741
And even though we weren't
playing, we were treating

297
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,338
you like us which totally
stressed you out.

298
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:59,661
And that just sucked the fun
right out of the game for you.

299
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,772
And having fun is
what makes you

300
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,575
really, really,
really good.

301
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,892
But being good doesn't
matter if we're too afraid

302
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,707
of letting ponies down.

303
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:11,556
Yeah. What about all those
ponies back in Ponyville

304
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:13,396
counting on us to win.

305
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,464
I'm sure folks want
you to win,

306
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:18,160
but not if worrying about
it makes you miserable.

307
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,252
Winning's never worth that.

308
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:23,587
But how do we keep
from worrying about it?

309
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:26,400
You could do what I do
and not think about it.

310
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:30,818
Seriously, I don't think
about anything. Ever.

311
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,046
Hmm, works for me!

312
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:41,963
And with another bouncing
goal from Pinkie Pie,

313
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:43,636
the score is tied!

314
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,212
You guys are amazing!

315
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:49,913
Braeburn is really good!

316
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:53,858
So is that Pegasus. Oh I
don't know if we can win.

317
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:55,563
You know what I would do...

318
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:58,436
Not think about it?

319
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,018
...not think--

320
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,369
Oh. Yeah. That.

321
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,372
And as long as
you're having fun,

322
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,778
it doesn't matter
if you win or not.

323
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:17,107
Hee-hee! I think it's
more fun this way.

324
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:23,027
And Pinkie wins the buckoff.
But her shot's rejected!

325
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,633
Back to Braeburn, whose
kick's stopped by another

326
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,000
Fluttershy save.
Next point wins.

327
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,307
Lots of tense back
and forth here.

328
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:35,267
Fluttershy unleashes
her patented spin move.

329
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,867
But Braeburn's there to-

330
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:40,166
NO! It's Pinkie with
a somersault kick.

331
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:44,935
What a move! And that's
the game! Ponyville wins!

332
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:50,393
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!

333
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:55,224
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!

334
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,695
Looks like you three
made quite an impression.

335
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:01,864
Well, cousin, I
have to admit,

336
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:04,738
your Ponyville team
played a pretty good game.

337
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:09,778
Ha! Good game? We bucked the
hooves right off of you.

338
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,252
Yep. You sure as shootin' did.

339
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,212
I'm gonna have to get real
serious about a strategy

340
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:16,566
for our rematch.

341
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:19,476
Oh, I wouldn't get too serious.

342
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:22,966
Yeah. Everypony knows the
secret to good Buckball

343
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,898
is just having fun!
