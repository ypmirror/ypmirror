      YES, AND ALSO I'M
     GLAD YOU'VE GOT WINGS.

00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,415
                This is amazing.

420
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,417
           I didn't know if
           you'd ever get wings.

           I'm so happy for you.

422
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,954
     Does it have something
     to do with this "molt"

423
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,174
     you were talking about?

424
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,592
[sigh] It's what's
been going on with me.

425
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,527
The break out, the fire burps.

426
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,697
The molt is when dragons get
older and start to change.

427
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,767
I wish I could stop
it, but I can't.

428
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,868
  I should go.

429
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,405
                Go? What are you
                 talking about?

430
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,375
  In the Dragonlands, families
  make molters leave home.

431
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,044
  It's called the Molt Effect.

432
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,614
Well, this isn't the Dragonlands
 and Molt Effect or no,

433
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,950
I don't want you going anywhere.

434
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,918
But I'm growing up.

435
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,887
What if something
even worse happens?

436
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,257
   You're supposed to grow up,
    but you'll always be you.

00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,593
   And whatever happens, we'll
    get through it together.

      Woohoo! Yeah! Look at
       me! Let's go home!

    carry you anymore, do I?

         You have wings.

                 They are new!

00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:44,642

                wanna overdo it.
