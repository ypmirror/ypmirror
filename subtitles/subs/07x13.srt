1
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:08,174
               Hm.

2
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,117
         Ah, thank you!

3
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,418
        You must be new.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,352
        I'm Apple Bloom.

5
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,555
  I'm Grand Pear.

6
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:23,955
      Welcome to Ponyville!

7
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,992
        Heh. You mean, welcome
       <i> back</i> to Ponyville!

8
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,094
   Grand Pear was
originally from here

9
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,297
 before he opened his famous
pear jam store in VanHoover!

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,500
  Really? Why'd you move back?

11
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:38,905
      I uh, well, I needed
        a change of pace.

12
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:40,339
               Ah.

13
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,108
       This is delicious!

14
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,478
I can't believe I've
 gone my whole life

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,580
without ever having this!

16
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:48,981
        Glad you like it.

17
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,182
                   How much?

18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:51,951
    Nah.

19
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,954
                Wow, thanks, Mr.
                Grand Pear, sir!

20
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,390
  It was real nice meetin' you!

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,233
Glad you're back, sugar cube!

22
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,602
Just in time for
breakfast-for-dinner!

23
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:13,372
  I got the perfect topper for
 flapjacks at the market today!

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,243
            PEAR JAM?!

25
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,044
What were you thinking!?

26
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,748
Quick, hide it!

27
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,319
              Huh?

28
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,261
      What's the big deal?

29
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,297
       It's just Pear Jam!

30
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,865
The big deal
is that there

31
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,299
is a long-
standing feud

32
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,035
between the Apples
and the Pears!

33
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,737
             Eee-yup!

34
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:18,938
                  Why?

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,273
                 Why!?

36
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,909
Well, uh, actually
I- I'm not really sure.

37
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,511
You have any idea, Big Mac?

38
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,880
Uuuuh, nope.

39
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,049
         Then I guess we
       should ask Granny?

40
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,317
Ask me what?

41
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,821
    Uhh, what goes better with
    apple fritter flapjacks,

42
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,689
    caramel syrup or praline?

43
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,491
  Pffft! Praline!

44
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,729
      Oh ho ho, that smells
        great, Applejack!

45
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,631
         I'm gonna wash
         up for supper.

46
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,566
         Be right baaack.

47
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,568
       Listen, sugar cube.

48
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,672
Anytime Big Mac and I ever
asked Granny about the feud

49
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,876
or the Pears, she'd get so
upset she couldn't talk.

50
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,577
Best not bring it up.

51
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,582
     OK... but that Grand Pear
     was really nice to me,

52
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,884
    even though I'm an Apple.

53
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:06,318
     I wonder what happened.

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,518
             Me too.

55
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,556
But if we can't ask Granny,
I don't know who--

56
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,925
We can ask Goldie Delicious!

57
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,462
If anypony knows about the
feud, it's the family historian!

58
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,131
         I'm in! Whaddya
          say, Big Mac?

59
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,100
       Sibling trip first
       thing tomorrow?

60
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,501
             Eee-yup!

61
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,451
       Now that's how you
       make an entrance!

62
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:40,751
        Or is it an exit?

63
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,423
   [chuckle] Well, anyway, it's so
   wonderful to see you three!

64
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,559
        To what do I owe
          the pleasure?

65
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,596
Well, Goldie, we were hoping you
could tell us about the... uh...

66
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,232
      feud with the Apples
         and the Pears.

67
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,701
         Oh...oh, dear!

68
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,903
        Does Granny Smith
        know you're here?

69
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,103
           No, ma'am.

70
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,075
  But.. I ran into Grand Pear
 yesterday and he was real nice.

71
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,444
      Maybe the feud was a
  misunderstanding or something

72
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,779
       and we can fix it?

73
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,682
     Hmm. Well, I don't know
     about that, little one.

74
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,818
        But.. if it's the
       story you're after,

75
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,754
       I suppose you have
        a right to know.

76
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,390
  Let's see here, I got a stack
    of books here someplace.

77
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:21,126
    Oh! Apple family history
    volume one-thirty-seven.

78
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,195
          Here we are!

79
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,830
      Feud with the Bears.

80
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,165
          I mean Pears.

81
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,301
       My eyes ain't what
        they used to be.

82
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:32,037
        A long time ago,
        Sweet Apple Acres

83
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,340
       wasn't the only
       farm in Ponyville.

84
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,609
   In fact, there was another
   one just right next door..

85
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,080
    Come and get your apples!

86
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,515
      Nothing sweeter than
    biting into a crisp apple

87
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,551
    on a beautiful fall day.

88
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:49,088
  Unless, of course, you could
     bite into a juicy pear!

89
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,788
            Pfft! Please!

90
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,824
   Pears are just what happens
     when you ain't no good

91
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,560
       at farming apples.

92
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,362
    Pears are nature's candy!

93
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,498
       Apples are.. sour,

94
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,833
     like the expression on
      your face right now!

95
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,035
    <i> Goldie: And so it went.</i>

96
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,039
   <i> Granny and Grand Pear were</i>
     <i> always at each other:</i>

97
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,739
    <i> Who was the best farmer?</i>

98
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,439
        <i> Who took better</i>
      <i> care of their trees?</i>

99
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,345
       <i> If Granny read to</i>
     <i> her trees at night...</i>

100
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,915
    "... And then the little
    tree reached its branches

101
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:20,686
     up to the moon and the
      moon said good night.

102
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,157
  <i> ... why then Grand Pear had</i>
     <i> special blankets made</i>

103
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,960
     <i> for his trees so they</i>
       <i> wouldn't get cold.</i>

104
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,561
       Good night, trees.

105
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,764
      I've got you covered.

106
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,199
             Mm hm.

107
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,777
<i>In fact, all the Apples and the</i>
 <i> Pears were rivals to the core.</i>

108
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,350
    <i> The only Apple and Pear</i>
       <i> who ever got along</i>

109
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:54,286
     <i> were Bright Macintosh</i>
        <i> and Pear Butter.</i>

110
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:56,522
                   Psst.

111
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,259
                I'm not supposed
                 to talk to you.

112
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,361
I'm not supposed to
talk to you either.

113
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,131
       My mom says if you hold a
      buttercup under your chin,

114
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,466
                 it'll make your
                   chin glow.

115
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,933
                  But it doesn't
                    work on me.

116
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:09,835
              See?

117
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,771
       Does it work on me?

118
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,308
        It sure does, buttercup.

119
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,412
 Buttercup. I
like that name.

120
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,614
       <i> Applejack: Wait an</i>
     <i> apple pickin' minute!</i>

121
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,150
    Bright Mac and Buttercup?

122
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,852
  Those are our parents names!

123
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,320
   Course, Buttercup was just
    the nickname your father

124
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,220
        gave your mother.

125
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:33,225
     Pear Butter. Well, that
       was her given name.

126
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,661
Are you saying our
mother was a<i> Pear</i> !?

127
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,735
                    So we are
                    half-Pear!?

128
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,971
  I can't
believe it!

129
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,371
How did we
 not know!?

130
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,576
    Well.. nopony called your
      mother Pear Butter...

131
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,545
    And her cutie mark was a
    preserve jar but pear butter

132
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,080
  don't look too much different
        from apple butter...

133
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,548
       so no clues there.

134
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,386
[sigh] Is there anything else you
can tell us about them?

135
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,789
        I know they loved
      each other very much!

136
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,925
          They had that
        magical, star-kissed,

137
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,462
         other side of a
        rainbow kind of love.

138
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,662
         You couldn't be
       around 'em too long..

139
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:15,366
    and not feel a little bit
   lighter than air yourself.

140
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,871
         Anything else?

141
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,340
   I'd need volume one hundred
   and thirty-eight for that.

142
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,744
 I'm sure I could wrangle it...

143
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,346
        in a couple days.

144
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,915
That's all
right, Goldie.

145
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,716
It was nice
just to hear--

146
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,185
         Ooh ooh! I just
      remembered somethin'!

147
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,054
               Your dad and his
               buddy, Burnt Oak,

148
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,824
       would get in all kinds of
      trouble together as colts!

149
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,792
   Burnt Oak?

150
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,761
The firewood salespony?

151
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,629
I haven't seen
him in ages.

152
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,599
   He and your dad were thick
   as thieves back in the day.

153
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:48,800
    Y'all should talk to him.

154
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,009
        Well, well, if it
        isn't the Apples!

155
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,611
     What can I do for you?

156
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,646
        I know you're not
       here for firewood.

157
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,550
      You've got more trees
     than anypony in Ponyville!

158
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:05,884
                   You're right.

159
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,153
        We're not here for that.

160
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,089
Come to ask
about your dad?

161
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,224
     Uh, eeeyup.

162
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,659
I wondered if you might.

163
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,827
I hoped you would.

164
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,262
It's nice to talk about him.

165
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,799
We had a lot of laughs.

166
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:21,899
In fact, this one time...

167

         The water silo.

        It was my fault.

179

00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,516
     And you, come with me.

181
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,988
No daughter of mine is gonna
make goo goo eyes at an Apple.

182
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,765
Grand Pear never
would have known

183
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,067
it was your
father's fault!

184
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,602
But there was no way
he'd let your mother

185
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,537
take the blame for
something he did.

186
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,773
    So Dad was super honest!

187
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,476
   Apple doesn't fall far from
    the tree huh, Applejack?

188
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,246
Your dad worked the
apple farm all day

189
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,581
and then headed over to the
 Pear's on his breaks

190
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,116
to fix the water silo.

191
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,585
I didn't see him for weeks!

192
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,785
Not that he minded.

193
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,022
Gave him a chance to
get to know your ma.

194
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,057
   Did you know our mom, too?

195
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,526
Buttercup was a real
peach of a Pear

196
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,294
but if you want to
know more about her,

197
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,562
you should ask
Mrs. Cake.

198
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,831
           Mrs. Cake?

199
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,733
She and your mom
were inseparable

200
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:02,768
when they were fillies!

201
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,302
                  Then let's go!

202
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,337
              Thanks, Burnt Oak.

203
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,144
    Er.. would it be OK if we
   stopped by again sometime?

204
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,745
      To hear more stories?

205
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,780
I'd like that very much.

206
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:27,125
 Well, cinnamon sugar on toast,
    all three Apple siblings!

207
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,193
Hi, Mrs. Cake. We heard you

208
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,895
and our ma used
to be real good friends

209
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,998
and we were hoping you could
tell us a bit about her.

210
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,534
      Oh, I would love to.

211
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,969
     I never knew the right
      time to bring it up,

212
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,571
    but I'm so glad you came. Haha!

213
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,242
    Oh. For starters, did you all
    know that it was your mom

214
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,411
        who convinced me
        to pursue baking?

215
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,147
 But isn't your name Mrs. Cake?

216
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,649
           Not always.

217
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,218
 Back when I was Chiffon Swirl,

218
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,488
      I had no idea what I
       was supposed to do.

219
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,959
But one day, your mom brought me
some candied pears, eggs, flour,

220
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,129
   sugar and vanilla and told
     me to just be creative.

221
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,429
       Next thing I knew,

222
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,465
        I was whipping up
      pear upside-down cake

223
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,301
    and I got my cutie mark!

224
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,936
    It was like she knew what
      I was supposed to do

225
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,738
       long before I did.

226
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,607
Just like you, sugarcube!

227
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,809
Or rather, you're
just like her!

228
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,545
       That was the first
      of many cakes for me

229
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,048
     and Buttercup was with
       me through it all.

230
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,450
   She'd be my taste tester...

231
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,087
          help with the
          decorating...

232
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,392
    and prep new ingredients.

233
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,330
        Over the years, I
      perfected my recipes.

234
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,201
  Your mom did so much for me,

235
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:46,705
       one day I wanted to
    surprise her with a cake.

236
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,198
       Oh, it's just you!

237
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,798
   Sorry.

238
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,669
I just brought you a little
something to say thank you...

239
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,204
but I.. see you're busy. Heh.

240
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,409
 Promise you won't say anything?

241
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,085
      What in tarnation are
     you doin', Bright Mac?

242
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,388
 We do not fraternize
  with Pears!

243

            Ptui!

244
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,096
You and Bright Mac?

245
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,366
Oof. I wouldn't believe it if I
hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

246
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,702
Your families hate each other!

247
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,106
            I can't help it, we
          just sort of happened.

                   Hey! No fair!

284
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,676
              I was gonna tell
             you the same thing!

285
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,678
You're just mad
I beat you to it.

286
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,613
                 I'm telling ya.

287
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,017
            I was gonna pull you
            up, cover your eyes,

288
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,685
      lead you over here...

289
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,188
       and say "surprise!"

290
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,129
       And then you'd say,
  "Oh, Bright Mac. I love it!"

291
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,532
                And then I'd say
                  "I love you."

292
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,533
               Too bad it didn't
               work out, though.

293
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,435
Yup. Too bad.

294
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,440
      The Pears are moving!

295
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,680
I mean, I figured
the Pears moved

296
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,216
but I didn't know all that
stuff happened before

297
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,918
with Granny and Grand Pear.

298
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,254
    It must have been really
      hard on our parents.

299
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,522
                   Oh, it was...

300
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,224
          We're moving!?

301
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,692
         To Van Hoover!?

302
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,194
       But that's so far!

303
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,763
It's what's best.

304
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,199
There's acres of
untouched land

305
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,134
and a warehouse to
make our jams!

306
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,003
We'll get to expand
our business

307
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,940
and get away from those
gosh darn Apples!

308
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,476
     <i> Mrs. Cake: Pear Butter</i>

309

  <i> But seeing no way out of it,</i>

310
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,549
                So, that's it?

311
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,517
What do you want me
to do, Bright Mac?

312
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,617
    We're moving.

313
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,922
I love you but I have
to stay with my family.

314
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,392
    <i> Then Bright Mac did the</i>

316
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:39,664
            What? What? Tell us!

317
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,934
    We're gonna need one more
    pony to tell that story.

318
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,503
     Mayor Mare, you
    knew our parents?

319
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,905
                    Not as well
                   as Mrs. Cake,

320
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,208
           but I did play a part
           in their love story.

321
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,443
            The night before the
             Pear family moved,

322
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,445
        Bright Mac asked
         me to meet him

323
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,947
      at the edge of Sweet
         Apple Acres...

324
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,523
I don't want to be
apart from you, ever.

325
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,993
I'm not sure what we'll
do but I'm sure of us.

326
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,329
So sure that I'd
marry you today.

327
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:14,398
                   I would too!

328
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,303
     I think that's my cue.

329
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:23,107
 <i> I had the honor of officiating</i>
 <i> your parents' secret wedding.</i>

331

00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,016
   <i> Big Mac: Hee hee. Eeeyup.</i>

334

   <i> Mayor Mare: So they had a</i>

335
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,857

336
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,157
    Granny: What is goin' on?

337
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,060
               What's with all
             these here candles?

338
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,129
        Grand Pear: Pear
     Butter, where are you?

339
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,665
You're supposed
to be packing!

340
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,700
What are you two doing?

341
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,038
        Ma, Grand Pear...

342
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,873
  Buttercup and I are in love.

343
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,375
              What!?

344
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,444
     And we'll be married as
   soon as Mayor Mare says...

345
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,280
       Oh! I now pronounce
      you husband and wife.

346
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,915
Doesn't that feel nice.

347
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,621
      What are you talkin'
         about? Married!?

348
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,290
You two can't be married!

349
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,124
        Finally something
        we can agree on!

350
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,327
       Pear Butter, enough
        of this nonsense.

351
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,265
   We're moving and you gotta
     stick with your family.

352
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,803
           But... the Apples are
            my family now, too.

353
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,175
You can't be serious.

354
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,078
Are you.. choosing
 to be an Apple?

355
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,679
Over being a Pear?

356
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,784
        Are you making
          me choose?

357
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,719
       Yes. I am.

358
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,189
           Then yeah.

359
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,624
          I guess I am.

360
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:51,229
Fine!

361
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,506
I can't believe Grand Pear
just up and left Ma like that.

362
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,675
No wonder Granny never
told us about any of this.

363
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,078
  These things are never easy.

364
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,547
      And it's hard to know
     when it is a good time.

365
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,850
It seems to me that
now's as good a time as any.

366
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,119
         To talk to both
        our grandparents.

367
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,927
     Apple Bloom: 'Scuse me?
           Grand Pear?

368
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,063
             I'm Applejack and
           this is Big MacIntosh

369
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,332
           but you already know
          who we are, don't you?

370
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,001
            Sure do.

371
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,204
Did you really move to Ponyville
   just for a change of pace?

372
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,406
 No...

373
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,342
             Then you came here
            because you're sorry

374
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,045
             and you want to get
              to know us, too?

375
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,314
          I'm.. so sorry.

376
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:48,286
      I-I-I was just so angry,
       but I never...

377
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,221
  It's in the past, Grand Pear.

378
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,692
         Ooh, can I call
       you Grandpare Pear?

379
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,427
       [chuckle] Sure can!

380
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,831
   Now where'd you all get to?

381
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,167
           I ain't seen hide nor
          hair of you's all day.

382
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,969
            We've been all over.

383
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,138
     Learning about our parents.

384
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,107
            Goh. Y-Ye have?

385
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,809
And our grandfather.

386
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,449
           So you're back, hmmm?

387
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:19,851
 Sure am.

388
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,354
[grumble] Never should've left...

389
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,990
Finding you and learning all
about Mom and Dad...

390
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,925
I feel like I found
a piece of me

391
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,494
I didn't even
know was missing.

392
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,198
Hearing their story makes me
feel closer to them, somehow.

393
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,702
       I'm sorry, I shoulda told
       y'all about them sooner.

394
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,404
      And I should
     have been here.

395
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:45,676
  Ahh.. I can't believe I let a silly
  feud keep me from my family.

396
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,578
                Nothin's keeping
                you from us now.

397
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,614
                  Let's not miss
                  anything else.

398
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,882
       Applejack's right.

399
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,619
 Welcome back, prickly old pear.

400
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,823
[chuckles] Thanks, you old crab apple.

401
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,424
Now that we're
all together,

402
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,059
there's something we
want to show you.

403
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,462
Mom and Dad left us something
to remember them by.

404
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:05,363
Come on!

405
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,171
            Whoa! Wow!

406
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,174
         It's beautiful!

407
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,243
                It's impossible...

408
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,480
       If anything's
     gonna make it through,

409
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,949
     it's Apples <i>and</i>  Pears.
