   You're not the only pony to
   ever read a book, you know.

410
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,902
You're right, Twilight.

411
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,671
I'm sorry, but now
that I think about it,

412
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,074
I'm not so sure
about Dash's answer.

413
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,510
Could you do a
quick fact check?

414
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,847
     Oh, I know it's twenty!
     But if you want proof...

415
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,549
                 Wait! According
                 to rule 18.3,

416
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,551
I can't check outside
reference material!

        [gasp]

418
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,789
      Are you trying to
      get me disqualified!?

419
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:21,559
   What kind of pony would do
   that to their OWN TEAMMATE!?

420
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,498
You're right, Twilight! I
don't know what got into me!

421
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,734
I was so focused on
my correct answers,

422
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,704
   I wasn't thinking straight.
   Can you forgive me?

423
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,440
              It's OK, Sunburst.
              I understand.

424
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,509
        And I have a teammate of
        my own to apologize to.

425
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:43,114
  Lucky for you, Cranky's awake
  and according to rule 57.6b...

426
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,150
...players previously
disqualified for sleeping

427
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,521
may rejoin the game. Provided
they're well rested...

428
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,423
        Where am I? What
        time is it?

429
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,225
       Where are my
       morning hay cakes!?

431
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,765
       Pinkie, you were the best
       teammate I could ask for,

432
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,668
       but I let wanting to win
       keep me from seeing that.

433
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,970
Pfft. I knew you
wanted to win,

434
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,372
but I probably could
have helped a little.

435
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,241
And even if I
couldn't...

436
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,677
         we still could
          have had fun.

437
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,879
        I'm so sorry for
        not realizing it.

438
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,081
        I got so obsessed
         with one thing,

439
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,450
        I forgot what
        really mattered.

440
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,423
No! That doesn't
sound like YOU at all!

441
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,192
        Well, win or lose,
       nothing is more important

442
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:32,297
           than my friend or my
           team. TwiPie forever?

443
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,299
I don't know....

444
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,902
   I understand. I guess even
   the Princess of Friendship

445
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,938
       can mess things up
        with her friends.

446
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,439
Oh, it's not that.

447
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,442
It's just that I already
changed it to Team TwiBurst.

448
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,911
Now I guess I should
change it to SunDoodle?

449

   [munch]

450
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,282
                Actually, I have
                a better idea...

451
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,851
     According to rule 13.2,

452
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,220
      players can join the
      game at any time,

453
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,556
       provided they
        start from zero.

454
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:02,026
Wow. These rules are
<i>really</i> convoluted.

455
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,629
But doesn't starting from
zero mean we'll lose?

456
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,831
               Well, our chances
               aren't good,

457
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,835
      but the odds of having fun
      on team TwiPie are 100%!

458
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:18,209
     What is the name of the
