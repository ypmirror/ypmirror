I don't see what's

6
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:13,840
we had to meet her
here this early.

What is all this?

18
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,524
My sister Maud's
going to be here soon

19
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:41,303
and I need your help

20
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,432
taste-testing my
rock candy recipes.

21
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:45,966
Uh, we're happy to help
you, Pinkie Pie,

22
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:48,630
but this seems like an
awful lot of candy...

23
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,208
Even for you.

24
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,024
I may have gone a
teensy bit overboard.

Everypony ready for more?

28
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,774
My teeth hurt.

<i>(groan)</i>

30
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:44,193
I think we've had plenty.

31
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:46,755
And shouldn't you be on
your way to pick up Maud

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,806
from the train station?

33
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:50,068
But you've only tried
half of the flavors

34
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,166
and we have to choose
the perfect ones

35
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,248
before she gets here
so I have time to make more.

<i>(gobbling)</i>

37
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,492
Maud is your sister;

38
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,551
I'm sure she'll love
your rock candy.

39
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,590
And I'm pretty sure
you've made enough.

40
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,525
She's only staying
for the week.

41
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:08,101
It's not just
for Maud, silly.

42
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,843
I'm making candy
for all of us.

43
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:11,361
<i>(everyone groans)</i>

44
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:14,997
It's part of a very important,
super-duper special tradition

45
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,103
that only the closest and
bestest of friends can share.

46
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,295
We're going to make rock
candy necklaces together.

47
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:22,169
<i>(scream)</i>

48
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:26,419
<i>It all started when Maud and I</i>
<i>were fillies on the Rock Farm.</i>

49
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,508
<i>She taught me the Pie</i>
<i>family rock candy recipe.</i>

50
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,067
<i>It has a secret ingredient.</i>

51
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,578
<i>It's rocks.</i>

52
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:36,056
<i>And she showed me how</i>
<i>to string the pieces</i>

53
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,397
<i>to make them into a necklace.</i>

54
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,382
<i>And once we were</i>
<i>done, we'd trade.</i>

55
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,387
Maud and I have been trading
necklaces back and forth

56
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:46,435
since I moved to Ponyville.

57
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:48,723
They're a sign that we'll
always be best friends.

58
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,416
Aw, what a great tradition.

59
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:52,599
Hold on.

60
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:54,965
The "secret
ingredient" is rocks?

61
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:55,820
Yeah.

62
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,864
But these are a special kind
of rock that Maud discovered.

63
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,344
What kind of a rock are they?

64
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:02,930
I can't tell you that, silly.

65
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,514
(exaggerated whisper)
It's a secret.

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,020
Now that Maud is heading off
to get her Rocktorate

67
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,863
in Rock Science,

68
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:11,539
this may be our last
chance to trade them

69
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:12,952
for a really long time.

70
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,778
I can't wait for
you all to meet her.

71
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,780
I just know that my best
Ponyville friends

72
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:20,146
and my best sister friend are
going to become bestest friends.

73
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:24,019
We can make bestestest friend
rock candy necklaces together!

74
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,454
She expresses herself through
fashion just like Rarity.

75
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,229
And she's really smart and loves
reading, just like Twilight.

76
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,453
And she's honest and
loves forest things

77
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:33,211
and is good at games and...well?

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,683
SHE'S AWESOME!

79
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,617
She sounds amazing.

80
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:39,320
But won't she start worrying

81
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:41,451
if you aren't at the train
station when she gets here?

82
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:42,468
She sure will.

83
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:44,286
<i>(panicked gasp)</i>

84
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,434
I gotta get out of here!

85
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:46,909
<i>(crash)</i>

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,216
<i>(engine hum)</i>

87
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,505
<i>(dog barks)</i>

88
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,560
I sure hope Maud
has an appetite.

89
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:56,487
Never met a pony, or a
critter, who didn't love

90
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,300
Granny Smith's
apple-spice muffins.

91
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:00,230
Rarity: Oh! It's no use!

92
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:03,340
I simply cannot find
anything suitable to wear.

93
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,609
I doubt she'll notice
what anypony's wearing.

94
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,201
So what's the big deal?

95
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,612
The big deal is that it will be
very difficult to show Maud

96
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:15,098
what a strong fashion presence
we have in Ponyville

97
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,971
if the most fashion-forward
pony here

98
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:19,449
can't keep her hat
from falling apart.

99
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:22,961
I think we're all a little
nervous about Maud's visit.

100
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,835
She's Pinkie Pie's sister

101
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,795
and it's obvious Pinkie really
wants us to hit it off.

102
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,476
Being able to make those rock
candy necklaces together

103
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,898
is really important to her.

104
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,664
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

105
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,625
<i>Pinkie Pie: WE'RE HERE.</i>

<i>(boing boing)</i>

107
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:40,995
Where's Maud?

108
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,343
She's coming.

109
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:49,482
<i>Rainbow Dash:</i>
<i>you sure?</i>

110
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,406
She's not quite
as fast as me.

111
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:53,865
I asked Gummy to stay with
her in case she got lost.

112
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:04,161
Is she even moving?

113
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,763
WE'RE OVER HERE, MAUD!

114
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,180
<i>(sniff)</i>

115
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:21,937
Hmm.

116
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:23,549
(very laid back)
Sedimentary.

117
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:25,278
Huh?

118
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:27,898
This is a sedimentary rock.

119
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:33,276
That's really fascinating,
isn't it, girls?

120
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:36,171
We're just so thrilled you
could come for a visit

121
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:37,281
before your big trip.

122
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:39,773
Pinkie Pie has told
us so much about you.

123
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:43,342
I'm Twilight and this is
Applejack, Fluttershy,

124
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:45,369
Rainbow Dash, and Rarity.

125
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,445
We're ever so
glad to meet you.

126
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,184
We're just gonna
have the best time.

127
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,187
Pinkie Pie tells me you
share my love for fashion.

128
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:59,215
I'm really into expressing
myself through my wardrobe.

129
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,681
And what is the delightful
frock you're wearing now saying?

130
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,064
It doesn't talk.

131
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,332
It's a dress.

132
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,628
Oh! Yes. Of course.
I just meant...

133

<i>That's Owlowiscious...</i>

00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:21,094
Tank, Opal, and Angel.

138
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,138
Pinkie Pie told us
you have a pet, too.

139
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,507
He's in my pocket.

140
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,975
Oooh, You have a pocket pet?

141
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:30,329
Like a tiny mouse?

142
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,678
Or a baby bird?

143
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,313
Or a trained butterfly?

144
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,274
It's a rock.

145
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,650
His name is Boulder.

146
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,946
This is going to be the best,
most awesome, funnest week ever.

147
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,803
I can't wait for us all
to become bestest friends.

try one of Granny Smith's

150
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:06,037
famous apple spice muffins?

So, uh, Pinkie Pie
tells us you like games.

159
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:32,520
Boulder and I sometimes play a
game called "camouflage."

160
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:34,599
It's kind of like
"hide-and-seek,"

Maybe she was just
acting a little "off"
