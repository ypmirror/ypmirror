00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,613
  making y'all official
 graduates of this here school.

435
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,948
You've more than
earned them.

436
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,083
                Without even
                having to study!

437
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:59,007

       We are grad-u-ates!

440
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,767
  And, if you're interested, I
  think Starlight has a place

441
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,636
 for you at my school after all.

442
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,255
Really?
Wooo hooo!

443
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,873
   We could use some good
   friendship tutors on staff.

444
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,142
       And I hear you're
       the best out there.

445
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,310
Then what're we
waiting for?

446
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,879
Let's get tutoring!

447
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,982
          C'mon, Cozy!

448
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:28,519
And THAT's why this school needs
 you as our guidance counselor.
