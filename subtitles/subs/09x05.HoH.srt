416
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,566
But it'll have a stain!

417
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,135
       That doesn't change
      the truth inside it.

418
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,138
       Wait. Did you even
        read that thing?

419
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,309
Actually, er... no.
I guess I didn't.

420
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,545
          "PERFECTION."

421
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,547
            And the next part...

422
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,384
     "The Impossible Pursuit."

423
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,988
                   [laughter]

424
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,091
   Oh. That might've been
   useful to look at earlier...

425

               ♪♪

426
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:35,199
 Hm. Your total late fees come to...

427
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,468
         However much it
         is, I'll cover it!

428
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,738
      Uh, do you have a
      monthly payment plan?

429
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,839
      ...twenty-eight bits.

431
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:43,976
  That's it!?

432
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,611
    Yeah. Most ponies don't
    know it caps at a month.

433
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,147
        Probably because
       we don't tell them.

436
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,720
    Thank you! Your
   account is back to normal.

437
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,455
 Although we will be taking down

438
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,024
your Best Book Borrower picture...

439
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,960
  Um, is that really necessary?

440
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,296
   It just seems so.. permanent.

441
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,998
      I mean, I did return
      the book, after all.

442
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,167
    Ahem.

443
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,136
 OK. Letting the perfection go...

444
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,472
     You want me to
      reshelf this for you?

445
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,574
   Nope. It's an old edition.

446
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,344
     We've already replaced
     it with a new copy.

447
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:21,746
  In that case, can we keep it?

448
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,148
It might be a good
reminder to have around.

449
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,019
   You're sure? It's got a stain...

450
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,721
  That's what makes it perfect.
