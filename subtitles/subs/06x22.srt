1
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:08,915
Twilight?
Can you slow down a bit?

2
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:12,648
Sorry, Spike. It's just Pinkie
Pie, Rarity and Applejack

3
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:14,640
are getting back from their
Seaward Shoals boat trip.

4
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:16,555
And I can't wait to
hear all about it!

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,915
It's such a shame Rainbow Dash
and Fluttershy had to miss it

6
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,142
for their Cloudsdale
Flight School reunion.

7
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,924
Maybe the rest of us not going
was for the best anyway.

8
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:28,373
I know the three of them
were really looking forward

9
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:29,626
to getting out of their element.

10
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,315
Getting out of their element?

11
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:35,102
I think they all just
wanted to try something new.

12
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:37,893
Huh. I guess a boat
trip qualifies as that.

13
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:40,008
My only worry is
they'll be so excited,

14
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:40,937
they'll talk over
each other

15
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:42,235
and I'll miss some
of the details.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,582
Just to be safe, I may
need you to take notes.

17
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:46,320
Uh, right.

18
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:58,440
So how was the trip?

19
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,008
Well, at least you don't
have to worry about them

20
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:11,324
talking over each other.

22
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:00,128
I don't know what happened
on that boat trip,

23
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:02,845
but once Rarity, Applejack,
and Pinkie Pie have some tea

24
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,020
and talk it out, I'm sure
everypony will feel better.

25
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,600
Come on in,
everypony.

26
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,255
Gummy, Opalescence, and
Winona? This is a surprise.

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,735
Are Pinkie Pie, Rarity
and Applejack with you?

28
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,025
"Sorry darling, but I must
decline the invitation

29
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:32,050
to your soirée.

30
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,005
While I'm sure it will be
positively resplendent,

31
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,150
there are certain ponies I'd
rather not associate with

32
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,235
at the moment. Rarity."

33
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:45,195
Rarity's not coming? Aww.

34
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:47,570
So I polished my
scales for nothing.

35
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,855
"Sorry I can't make it,
but I'm still a mite upset

36
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,975
about everything that happened
on the boat. Applejack."

37
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,975
"Sorry I can't make
the tea party today,

38
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,355
but there's a small problem
with the guest list.

39
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:07,890
Plus, I'm right in the middle
of a very important cupcake.

40
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,345
Pinkie."

41
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:13,625
Come on, Spike. Since our
friends won't come here

42
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,225
and tell us what happened,
we'll just have to go to them.

43
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,840
Right behind you.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,565
I am sorry,
but my mane wasn't made

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,980
to support marine life.

46
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,430
Ruined. Completely ruined.

47
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,615
I don't know, Rarity.
Maybe you could--

48
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,195
Throw it away? Yes, I agree.

49
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:47,860
Just another innocent casualty
of that disastrous boat trip.

50
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:49,405
About that.

51
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,160
Spike and I were wondering
what happened out there.

52
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,810
Please, darling, I don't
know if I'll ever be able

53
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:59,130
to discuss it. It's
far too painful.

54
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,115
If it's too difficult
to talk about,

55
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,385
we completely understand.

56
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:05,875
Well, since you
dragged it out of me:

57
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,775
It all started
at the docks.

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,650
I knew Applejack and Pinkie
Pie wanted to get out

59
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,085
of their element, so I
thought I would surprise them

60
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:17,115
with an elegant cruise.

61
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,805
I had brought a small bag with
just a few key essentials.

62
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:23,660
All right, ponies.

63
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,915
Prepare yourselves for
luxury on the high seas!

64
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:29,705
That sounds... fun.

65
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,310
The sea air carries a portent
for trouble this day.

66
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,685
T'is a treacherous
and perilous journey

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,950
that lies ahead of us.

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,915
We sail to adventure
or our very doom.

69
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,450
I have no idea
what you just said,

70
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:52,975
but your wardrobe is
delightfully seaworthy!

71
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:00,995
Despite Applejack's
colorful seafarer attitude,

72
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:03,725
I was still determined
to get my friends

73
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:05,570
out of their element
by providing them

74
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:08,370
with all the refinements
of a luxury cruise.

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,345
I'd made sure to bring the
most delectable nibbles

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,595
for them to enjoy.

77
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,435
Oooh. I brought food, too!

78
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:19,635
Let's see, I've got cotton
candy, taffy, circus peanuts

79
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,000
and lots of other
super-yummy stuff.

80
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,025
Oooh Pinkie Pie, that all
looks positively delectable,

81
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,355
but you simply must try one
of these cucumber sandwiches.

82
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:30,975
Dig in!

83
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:37,100
Hmmm.

84
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:39,615
Arrgh! Get those off me ship!

85
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:45,405
Ohh, I'm so sorry.

86
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,810
I had no idea you had such
distaste for cucumbers!

87
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,360
Yar-har-har-har!
Hardy-har-har-har.

88
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,790
Hmmm. That doesn't
sound like Applejack.

89
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,550
Well, hold on, because
it gets even worse.

90
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:02,280
Pinkie tried to
lighten the mood

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,420
with some fun
maritime games.

92
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,710
It's Piñata O'clock! Wanna
give it a whack, Rarity?

93
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,215
Oh, darling, of course!

94
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,985
Har-har! Har-har!

95
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,260
I'll be chartin' a
course to the very heart

96
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:22,340
of that maelstrom.

97
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:31,120
Uh, Applejack?
Just a thought,

98
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:34,805
but maybe we should steer the
ship toward calmer waters.

99
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,740
This be the only
way to Plunder Cove.

100
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:48,230
Perhaps if I take a quick
look-see at that map of yours,

101
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,470
I could find us a more
cruise-friendly path.

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,970
There'll be no mutiny
aboard me ship!

103
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:55,870
Look at me! I'm
the captain too!

104
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,910
<i> Clearly Pinkie Pie had caught</i>
<i> Applejack's sea madness.</i>

105
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,640
Is that all you've
got? Yar-hahah-HAR!

106
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,575
Then what happened!?

107
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:18,045
Oh, the boat sank, obviously.

108
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:26,875
So, Applejack got some
sort of "sea madness"

109
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,140
and caused the
boat to capsize?

110
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:32,395
After all the effort I put
in to provide her and Pinkie

111
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,100
with the exact luxury
cruise they needed

112
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,360
to get out of
their elements,

113
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:38,105
that is how
Applejack thanked me.

114
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:40,970
So, you were stuck out in
the middle of the ocean?

115
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:42,985
How in Equestria
did you get back?

116
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,830
Spike, darling, you'll
have to forgive me.

117
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,225
I'm far too emotionally
drained to discuss

118
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:50,605
the matter any further.

119
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,630
Rarity? I don't suppose
there's any chance

120
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:57,505
you might be uh, exaggerating
things just a little?

121
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,850
Well! I can assure you that
that is exactly what happened.

122
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:05,270
And if you don't believe
me, you can ask Pinkie Pie.

123
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08,115
I am quite certain her
story will be the same.

124
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,490
So, that's what Rarity said
happened on the boat, huh?

125
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,665
We thought there was a
chance she might have [ahem]

126
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,120
embellished the
story just a tad.

127
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,655
So we wanted to hear about
what happened from you.

128
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:26,325
Did Applejack really
capsize the boat?

129
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,235
Of course not!
That's just silly.

130
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,550
There's no way Applejack
could have sank the boat.

131
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:33,190
I knew it!

132
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,400
That's a relief.

133
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,305
Because Rarity did!

134
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:37,610
What?!

135
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:40,270
It all started on the docks.

136
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,045
I knew Rarity and
Applejack wanted to get

137
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,245
out of their element, so
I figured I'd throw them

138
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,925
the funnest, silliest
boat party ever.

139
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:51,930
But I guess Rarity
had other ideas.

140
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:57,360
<i> I thought I overpacked</i>
<i> until I saw Rarity</i>

141
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,765
<i> and her team of</i>
<i> porter ponies.</i>

142
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,260
Prepare yourselves
for a luxury cruise!

143
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,390
A day of opulence,
decadence and extravagance!

144
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:10,950
That sounds fun.

145
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,665
Ahoy, mateys! Batten
down the hatches, ya'll

146
00:09:14,715 --> 00:09:17,810
'cause this here's gonna be
a boat ride of adventure!

147
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,820
I can live with that.

148
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:32,440
Huh. They just keep coming.

149
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,810
<i> Now you can't throw a silly</i>
<i> boat party without snacks,</i>

150
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,720
<i> so I made sure to pack</i>
<i> the funnest party food</i>

151
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:41,650
<i> I could find.</i>

152
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,030
Rarity? Would you care
for some cotton candy?

153
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,165
It's freshly spun!

154
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:53,625
Oh, Pinkie Pie, those all
look simply... well, simple.

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,650
But they're obviously
unfit for a luxury cruise.

156
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:02,855
Now my cucumber sandwiches
on the other hoof...

157
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,710
Try one. Then you'll understand.

158
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:09,560
Oh, are those
chocolate-chip?

159
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,055
Sorry, cucumber sandwiches
are so ten seconds ago.

160
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,670
Wait, wait, wait. That
doesn't sound like Rarity.

161
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,565
Just wait until you hear
how much more unlike her

162
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,440
she sounds!

163
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:28,740
I thought I'd lighten
the mood with some

164
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:30,740
super-fun party boat games.

165
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,110
But Rarity was a
real wet blanket.

166
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:38,955
It's Piñata Time! Oooh! Wanna
give it a whack, Rarity?

167
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,880
Oh, you were serious.
Well, that's adorable.

168
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,695
I'll give it a go!

169
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:54,310
That's the spirit. Let's get
this boat party started!

170
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,995
Whoa, doggy!

171
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,300
Tug of war? Now we're talking!

172
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,965
Whoever wins gets to
be captain!

173
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,975
Or one of us could
just be captain now.

174
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,465
Oh don't worry, dear.
Luxury cruises never sink!

175
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:38,375
What?!

176
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,095
And that's why
the boat sinking

177
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,075
was all Rarity's fault.

178
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,830
That seems odd. I mean,
we trust you, of course,

179
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,705
but it's all so
extraordinary.

180
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,920
Oh, it's extraordinary,
all right.

181
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,445
But that's exactly
what happened.

182
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,315
In fact, the only thing
I might have gotten wrong

183
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,140
was that there were
even MORE porter ponies.

184
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,925
But just to be safe, you
should talk to Applejack.

185
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,220
She'll know exactly how many
porter ponies there were.

186
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,865
OK, but if the boat sank,
how did you all get rescued?

187
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,775
Oh, that's easy. We just...

188
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,455
My muffins!

189
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,915
That's it. We've got to
go talk to Applejack.

190
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,260
Good idea. She'll
straighten this out.

191
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,720
I just really, really want to
know how they made it back.

192
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,670
But yeah, that'd be great, too.

193
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,535
Hold on a tick. Pinkie Pie
says it's Rarity's fault

194
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:36,120
And Rarity says I
sank the boat?

195
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,020
Well, that's plum crazy.

196
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,825
If you two really want to know
what happened, I'll tell ya.

197
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,515
Y'all know how Pinkie
Pie and Rarity wanted to

198
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:44,765
get out of their element?

199
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,685
Well, I brought a treasure map
to give 'em a rip-roaring,

200
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:48,960
seafaring adventure!

201
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:52,865
<i> But they had other ideas.</i>

202
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,960
La-la-la! Prepare
yourselves for the most

203
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:59,490
luxurious boat outing
that ever outed a boat!

204
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,415
And more fun than you
can shake a stick at

205
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,360
because I brought a stick!

206
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,775
All right, mateys. But just
y'all wait till you see

207
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,425
the high-seas adventure
I've got planned.

208
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,730
<i> Unfortunately, they</i>
<i> seemed less interested</i>

209
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,445
<i> in a treasure</i>
<i> hunting adventure</i>

210
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:32,055
<i> and more interested</i>
<i> in snacks.</i>

211
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:37,270
Oh darling, that food
isn't fit for a pony

212
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,860
of proper breeding, darling
and refinement, darling.

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,005
Now my cucumber sandwiches
on the other hoof...

214
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:45,575
Betcha I can fit
them all in my mouth!

215
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,370
Pinkie, darling, please!

216
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,785
Uh-oooh!

217
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:53,280
Agh!

218
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,110
Rarity, I--

219
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,210
Well, I never! Humpha!

220
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,145
Me neither! Humpha!

221
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:10,485
Do you want to say
it or should I?

222
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,510
I'll go.

223
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:14,275
That sure doesn't sound
like Rarity or Pinkie Pie.

224
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,235
Oh, it gets a sight
worse than that.

225
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,085
It's P.W.T.!
Piñata-whacking time!

226
00:14:23,985 --> 00:14:27,290
Oh, darling, "whacking"
is a base pastime

227
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,805
for common ponies, doesn't
interest me in the least.

228
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,105
Meh.

229
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,995
Hee hee!

230
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,920
Huh?

231
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:46,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

232
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:53,285
Looks like we need
to change course.

233
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,315
Oooh! Why, this will
make a perfect tablecloth

234
00:14:58,345 --> 00:14:59,650
for my cheese board.

235
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,155
Maybe so, but it's also the
only way to find Thunder Cove!

236
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:06,925
And Pinkie Pie was
just about as helpful

237
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:08,585
as a weasel in a hen house.

238
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,815
Captain Pinkie Pie
reporting for map duty!

239
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,865
Hold on, everypony!

240
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,285
Wait, so it was Rarity
and Pinkie's fault?

241
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,805
Yup. And maybe if
they ever apologize,

242
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,605
I'll consider talking
to them again.

243
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:39,555
If they all blame
each other,

244
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:41,805
I don't know how we're going
to get them to talk again.

245
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,195
Neither do I,
Spike. Neither do I.

246
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,890
There's got to be some way
to fix this. If Applejack,

247
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,475
Pinkie Pie, and Rarity keep
not talking to each other,

248
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,880
they could forget what good
friends they really are.

249
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:00,995
I just don't get it.

250
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,000
All of their stories
are so different.

251
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,550
We're never going to figure
out what really happened.

252
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,160
Their stories were different,

253
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,385
but they also had
a lot in common.

254
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,045
I guess. They were all on
a ship that sank and...

255
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,470
that's about it.

256
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,165
Not quite.

257
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,880
Ah-ha! Not only do I think
I know how the boat sank,

258
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,975
I have a pretty good idea
how to get Rarity, Applejack,

259
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,125
and Pinkie Pie back together!

260
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:41,200
I hope this plan of yours works.

261
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,755
Winona brought me your note
about a friendship emergency.

262
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,130
How can I help?

263
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:50,275
Opalescence delivered
your message, Twilight.

264
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,535
What's the emergency?

265
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,080
It's a good thing it was time
for Gummy's bath, or I might

266
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,540
not have seen your note about
the emergency, Twilight.

267
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,750
What's she doing here?

268
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:02,290
Sorry, but I just
didn't know how else

269
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,965
to get the three of
you here together.

270
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,425
And there really is a
friendship emergency. Yours!

271
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:12,410
Oh, there's no emergency. I'm
just waiting for an apology.

272
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,440
An apology?

273
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,415
What?

274
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,315
Why would you want
me to apologize,

275
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,080
when it was Rarity's fault?

276
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:20,490
What are you
talking about?

277
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,585
Applejack clearly
caused the boat to sink!

278
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,635
She stranded us in the
middle of the ocean!

279
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,960
UGH! Will somepony please
tell me how you made it back?

280
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,610
Well, maybe it wasn't
the middle of the ocean.

281
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,275
Even so, I don't appreciate
being hornswoggled

282
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:50,395
into coming back here.

283
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:52,985
On that, at
least we agree.

284
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:53,795
Yeah.

285
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:56,155
I know you each have a
different perspective

286
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:58,620
on how the boat capsized
and blame each other...

287
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,435
but if you come on
the boat with me,

288
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,385
I'll show you what
really happened.

289
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,955
Well, not that I
have any doubt,

290
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,305
but it will feel good for
everypony to see exactly

291
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,855
whose fault it was.

292
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,230
I think we all
know which pony's

293
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,980
about to be proven right.

294
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,120
We sure do!

295
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:21,935
Like I said, I sure
hope this works.

296
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,110
Heh heh heh.

297
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,675
Whatever you're looking for,
I hope you find it soon.

298
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,180
Don't worry, Spike. I've
got it all under control.

299
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,010
While all of your stories
seemed very different,

300
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,240
they all had something in
common. Cucumber sandwiches!

301
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,645
What in the hay does that
have to do with anything?

302
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,125
And why would you waste a
perfectly good hors d'œuvre?

303
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,540
You also mentioned
the bubbling water.

304
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,795
And the swell.

305
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,430
Cucumber just happens
to be the favorite food

306
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:07,235
of the Tri-horned Bunyip. And
bubbles, followed by a swell

307
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,450
is what happens when they
swim up to the shallows

308
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,600
from deep water!

309
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:15,815
So, we attracted a tri-horned
whatchamacallit...

310
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,210
With cucumber
sandwiches?

311
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,540
Sounds like a stretch.

312
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,530
Hello, Bunyip, sir.

313
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,250
So that's a...

314
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:32,710
A Tri-horned Bunyip...

315
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:34,870
Who's very sorry
he accidentally

316
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:36,995
knocked over your
boat, right?

317
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,020
Wait; the storm had nothing
to do with the capsizing?

318
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,345
Nope.

319
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,790
All right. Even if our friend
the Bunyip is responsible

320
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,810
for sinking the boat,

321
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,850
that still doesn't excuse
a certain pony's behavior.

322
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,430
Me!? How about you
and Pinkie Pie?

323
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:56,565
Pfft! Wha-?! How- ME?--

324
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,490
I think I can
explain that too.

325
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,005
Each one of you spent so
much time trying to come up

326
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,460
with the perfect way
to get the others

327
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,555
out of their element,
that you didn't notice

328
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,335
your friends were
doing the same thing.

329
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:11,100
Wait a minute. You brought all
those games and things for us?

330
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,400
Of course! I figured the boat
trip was the perfect time

331
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,330
to do things that
were silly and fun.

332
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:19,430
And I was just trying
to give the two of you

333
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:21,855
the elegant cruise I
thought you deserved.

334
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:25,355
And I just wanted to give you
two a high seas adventure,

335
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,005
since that'd be something
new and different for y'all.

336
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,975
OOOOHHHHHHH.

337
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,135
That is so sweet.

338
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,280
You must have gone
through so much trouble.

339
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,750
Well, not half as much
trouble as you did

340
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:41,290
making all that fancy food.
And bringing all those games.

341
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,400
I guess this just teaches us
that even longtime friends

342
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,165
need to work at communication.

343
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,400
Well, there's something
I'd like to communicate

344
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:49,785
to you all right now.

345
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,395
You girls are the best friends
a pony could ever have.

346
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,080
Oh, let's never
fight again!

347
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:57,100
Agreed.

348
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:57,850
You've got it!

349
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,680
All right, you big
softy. Bring it in.

350
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:10,865
Come on, Bunyip,
sir. You've got it!

351
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,485
One thing's for sure, Spike.

352
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,370
There's nothing like a
luxurious adventure boat party

353
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,325
to get you out of your element.

354
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,100
You said it!
