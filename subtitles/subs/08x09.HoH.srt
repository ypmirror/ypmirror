      To tell ya the truth?

432
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,107
              Yeah.

433
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,542
Well, not <i>all</i> the time.

434
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,878
I agreed with you for
the whole nature walk!

435
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,181
 Only cause you were anglin' for
that Teacher of the Month award.

436
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:24,950
                      [groan]

437
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,318
YOU were the one
doing the angling.

438
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,390
       [arguing continues]
