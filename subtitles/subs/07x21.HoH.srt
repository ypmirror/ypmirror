  cutie mark on the first day!

      Yep. This camp was a

 Trying to find out what you're
 meant to do can be frustrating.

Well, we can't let Rumble
quit camp just because

he didn't find something
he's good at yet.

just heard Rumble say--

     Not wanting a cutie mark is
    like not wanting to breathe.

187
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,859
Everypony wants to know
what they're meant to do.

      Hmph! Not this pony.

              WHY?

190
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,399
       Because Cutie Marks
        are silly and...

191
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,402
  and they just force you into
   one thing your whole life!

          That's silly.

193
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:28,073
   Having a cutie mark doesn't
 mean you can't do other things.

194
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,975
Yeah! Our cutie marks
are in helping ponies

with their cutie marks,

196
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,846
but I still like making
potions with Zecora.

197
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,616
      And when was the last
       time you did that?

Um...I-I-I think it was... uh...

Well, we've been pretty busy
helping other ponies lately--

200
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,427
  Oh. You mean doing the thing
  you got your cutie mark for?

201
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,597
  The thing you're stuck doing
   for the rest of your life?

202
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,500
   OK, maybe we will be doing
  that more than anything else,

203

      Cutie Mark Crusaders!

     thing I've ever heard.

   have to find their own hay.

   mean "find their own way?"
