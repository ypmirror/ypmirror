1
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,497
Oh. Hi, Pinkie Pie.

2
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:18,799
<i>This is your singing telegram
I hope it finds you well</i>

3
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>You're invited to a party
Cause we think you're really swell</i>

4
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,677
<i>Gummy's turning one year old
So help us celebrate</i>

5
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:27,836
<i>The cake will be delicious
The festivities first-rate</i>

6
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:31,400
<i>There will be games and dancing
Bob for apples, cut a rug</i>

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,389
<i>And when the party's over
We'll gather round for a group hug</i>

8
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,842
<i>No need to bring a gift
Being there will be enough</i>

9
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,800
<i>Birthdays mean having fun with friends
Not getting lots of stuff</i>

10
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:48,171
<i>It won't be the same without you
So we hope that you say yes</i>

11
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:52,636
<i>So please, oh please, R.S.V.P.
And come and be our guest</i>

12
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,503
Next time I think I'll just
pass out written invitations.

13
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,639
Nice one. Now let me show you
how it's really done.

14
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,119
Hey, girls!

15
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,565
Hey, Pinkie Pie.

16
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:55,680
Howdy!

17
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,161
Just wanted to tell you how happy I am
that you could make it to Gummy's party.

18
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:01,746
Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

19
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:03,104
Me neither.

20
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:06,149
When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there!

21
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:09,966
TADA!

22
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,038
Ah, it's just a boring old apple.

23
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:14,528
Don't worry. There're plenty of other surprises in there.

24
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,322
What kind of surprises?

25
00:02:16,398 --> 00:02:19,565
I can't tell you that, silly.
Then it wouldn't be a surprise!

26
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:36,792
This punch is simply divine.

27
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:40,304
Is this the same recipe you used
for your "Spring has Sprung" party?

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,695
No, something new.

29
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:48,222
It's Gummy's favorite!

30
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:56,084
Ooh! This is my jam!

31
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:01,162
Having fun?

32
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,525
A blast!

33
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,531
You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie.

34
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:08,584
They're always the best parties,
cause my best friends are always there!

35
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:14,578
Come on, everypony!

36
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:18,460
Gummy wants to dance!

37
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,399
Go Gummy! It's ya birthday!
Go Gummy! It's ya birthday!

38
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:30,443
Hooie! I am beat.

39
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:31,876
Haven't danced that much since...

40
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:33,741
Well... since you last party.

41
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:35,205
Thanks again for the invite!

42
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:36,635
See you later, birthday alligator!

43
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:39,310
Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soirée.

44
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,592
It's been lovely.

45
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:44,433
You sure you don't wanna stay?
There's still some cake left.

46
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,019
Uh... I think I'm gonna pass.

47
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:50,175
Great party, though.
We should do this again soon.

48
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,502
We should do this again soon!

49
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:07,517
Oh. Hi, Pinkie...

50
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:08,436
It's soon!

51
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:09,556
Pardon me?

52
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:12,276
You said we should have
another party soon and... it's soon!

53
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:14,176
Here is your invitation!

54
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:17,772
"You're invited to Gummy's after-birthday party."

55
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:19,739
"This afternoon at 3 o'clock."

56
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,415
All our bestest friends are invited...

57
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:24,555
...and here's gonna be dancing and games
and cake and ice cream and punch...

58
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,359
This afternoon?

59
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:29,216
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?

60
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:30,694
Yes, indeedy!

61
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:32,180
Oh, gosh.

62
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,053
I wish I could make it but I've
gotten a bit behind in my studies.

63
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:39,631
I've really gotta hit the books.

64
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:43,027
I understand. Your studies come first.

65
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:46,154
But don't worry! We'll be sure
to save you some cake.

66
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,141
Please do!

67
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,117
Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books.

68
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,592
You should really just read them.

69
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,099
I'll keep that in mind.

70
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:58,971
Oh hi, Pinkie Pie.

71
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,803
What brings you here round these parts?

72
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:04,015
Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?

73
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:08,225
It's an invitation at Gummy's
after-birthday party this afternoon!

74
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,942
There's gonna be dancing and games
and cake and ice cream and punch...

75
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:12,313
This afternoon?

76
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:14,574
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?

77
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:17,126
That's funny. That's just what Twilight said.

78
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:19,909
And the answer is "Yes, it's this afternoon".

79
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,427
Oh... Well, I... I, uh...

80
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:24,265
I don't think I can make it, cause, uh...

81
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:25,394
I have to, uh...

82
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,141
Uh, you know... I, uh...

83
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:28,985
Pick apples!

84
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:31,470
Yep, apples, cause that's what we do.

85
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,123
With, uh... apples. We, uh...

86
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,779
Pick 'em.

87
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,065
Okie dokie lokie!

88
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:49,239
A party is still a party,
even if there're only three guests.

89
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:59,577
Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?

90
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:03,012
Mmm... Perhaps you could take a bath.

91
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:04,902
How do I put this delicately...

92
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:06,851
You smell like a rotten apple core...

93
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:10,137
...that's been wrapped in moldy hay
and dipped in dragon perspiration.

94
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,689
Ooh, love the new hat.
Very modern. What's the occasion?

95
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,990
Gummy's after-birthday party is this afternoon.

96
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,649
I'm delivering the invitations.

97
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,911
The party is this afternoon?

98
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:29,148
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?

99
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:31,770
It's so strange. Everypony keep saying that?

100
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,434
Oh, do they?

101
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:36,648
I know it's short notice, but we had
such a great time at this birthday party...

102
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:39,445
...I thought we could have even
more fun at this after-birthday party.

103
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,884
And I'm sure that we would,
but I'm going to have to decline.

104
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:44,780
I have to... wash my hair.

105
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,437
Don't be silly. Your hair doesn't look dirty.

106
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:48,639
-It doesn't?
-Nope.

107
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,497
See? Dirty.

108
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,000
I have to go.

109
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,984
Huh. No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity.

110
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,161
Oh well. A party is still a party,
even with only two guests.

111
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:08,722
This afternoon?

112
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:10,140
-As in...
-Yes!

113
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:12,263
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon.

114
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:14,779
Oh man, we'd love to, but...

115
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,126
...we're... house-sitting this afternoon.

116
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:18,887
Huh... Both of you?

117
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,294
It's a... a big house.

118
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:25,304
Uh, look at the time!
We'd really better get going.

119
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:27,553
Wait!

120
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,260
Maybe I could bring you some
after-birthday cake and ice cream?

121
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,951
Who you house-sitting for?

122
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:32,743
Harry.

123
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:33,475
Harry?

124
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,952
Yeah, I don't think you known him.

125
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:37,815
That's strange. I know just about
everypony around here.

126
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,476
He's... a bear.

127
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,341
A bear?

128
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:43,352
Yep! He's a bear, all right.

129
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:46,400
And he'll be pretty upset if we don't
get over to his house soon, heh.

130
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,557
Wait!

131
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:51,344
There's a bear around here who lives in a house?

132
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:53,910
It's... really more of a cave.

133
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,796
But he sticks the place up
so much it feels like a house.

134
00:07:57,422 --> 00:08:00,855
And, uh... he wants us to look after
his house, uh, cave while he's...

135
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,920
At the beach!

136
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,644
He's vacationing at the beach?

137
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:05,548
Yep! He loves to...

138
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,631
-Collect seashells.
-Play volleyball.

139
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:10,382
-Play volleyball.
-Collect seashells.

140
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,072
-Collect volleyball.
-Play seashells.

141
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:14,936
Gotta go!

142
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:22,592
Something strange is definitely
going on around here, Gummy.

143
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:25,784
Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to
house-sit for that vacationing bear...

144
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:29,373
...but what are the chances all my other friends
would have plans this afternoon too?

145
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:33,310
Rarity has to wash her hair...
Applejack has to pick apples...

146
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,225
Twilight is behind on her studies
and has to hit the books...

147
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:40,514
The more I think about it, the more
those are starting to sound like...

148
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,716
Excuses!

149
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:54,776
That didn't look like studying.

150
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:56,289
Or hitting.

151
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,496
Oh! You must be here for...

152
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:05,096
Shh!

153
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:09,056
-Is Pinkie Pie around?
-Oh, I don't think so.

154
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:12,090
Good.I don't want her
to know anything about this.

155
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,839
Yes, of course. I'll be right back.

156
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:18,667
But... we're friends.

157
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,443
What wouldn't Twilight want me
to know anything about?

158
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:23,871
She's coming back.

159
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,195
There you go.

160
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:28,345
Thanks. And remember, not a word to Pinkie Pie.

161
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:31,357
Hey! What's with the tin can?

162
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:53,270
Time to get to the bottom of things.

163
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:06,363
I think our cover's been blown.

164
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,333
I need a new disguise.

165
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:21,147
She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?

166
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:22,531
I don't think so.

167
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:25,409
Oh, good. I'd hate for her to ruin everything.

168
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:26,480
Me too.

169
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:55,291
-Have you seen her?
-Not since this morning.

170
00:10:55,291 --> 00:11:00,162
Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on
throwing an after-birthday party *today*?

171
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:03,744
I'm just glad I was able to come up
with an excuse for why I couldn't be there.

172
00:11:03,844 --> 00:11:07,020
Me too. This obviously
going to be so much better.

173
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,864
As long as we keep her from
finding out about it, it will.

174
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,557
See you later!

175
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:30,665
I thought everypony loved my parties.

176
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,291
Hi, Pinkie Pie!

177
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,856
Uh-oh.

178
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:37,361
Rainbow Dash! Wait!

179
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:44,693
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?!

180
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:56,964
WHAT'S THE REAL REASON YOU DON'T
WANNA COME TO GUMMY'S PARTY?!

181
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:10,957
WHAT'S IN THOSE BAGS?!

182
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,187
Applejack! We have a problem!

183
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:28,598
I know you're in there!

184
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:31,831
Oh, uh... howdy partner!

185
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,771
Mind if I... take a look inside the barn?

186
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:38,648
No... I mean, yes... I mean,
you can't come in here.

187
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:40,374
Rainbow Dash just went in there.

188
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:43,331
Oh, well, she was just
bringin' in some... supplies.

189
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,868
Yep, supplies for the... renovation.

190
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,995
Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom.

191
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:51,379
Uh... lotsa construction going on
in there right now!

192
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,827
You heard her. Construction!

193
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:16,248
Yup! Construction. That's my story
and I'm stickin' to it, heh.

194
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,723
Okie dokie lokie.

195
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,496
Secrets and lies. It's all secrets
and lies with those ponies.

196
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:48,244
They're up to something, Gummy.
Something they don't want me to know about.

197
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,698
Well, I'm gonna know about it.

198
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:52,641
I'm gonna know about it big time!

199
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:55,929
And I know just who's gonna
tell me all about it.

200
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,063
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BIG TIME!

201
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,736
Wow... Nice spread!

202
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,690
It's all yours, Spike.

203
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,674
All you have to do is talk.

204
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,015
That's it? Oh, you got it.

205
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:17,259
Okay... Uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh?

206
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,344
I love sunny spring day, don't you?

207
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:21,948
The birds chirping, the flowers blooming...

208
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:22,900
No, no, no.

209
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,603
Talk about our friends.

210
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:26,528
Oh. Okay.

211
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:29,510
Let's see. There's Twilight Sparkle,
she's a unicorn.

212
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,452
Good with magic, real brainiac.

213
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:34,140
And then we got Rarity. Total knockout!

214
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,228
Twilight seems to think I don't have a chance
with her, but... eh, what does she know?

215
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:40,086
Let's see, there's... there's Fluttershy,
a pegasus afraid of height.

216
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,519
Huh, what's up with that?

217
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:43,712
No! You're not understanding me!

218
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,526
I want you to confess!

219
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:46,607
Confess?

220
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:47,874
CONFESS!

221
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:54,593
I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's
copy of Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions!

222
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:56,464
And?

223
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,658
And I'm the one who used up
all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday...

224
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:01,211
...when I took a seven-hour bubble bath.

225
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:03,032
And?!

226
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:06,484
And sometimes, when no one's around...

227
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:07,463
...I do this.

228
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,762
Looking good, Spike. Looking real good.

229
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,648
No... No! No! NO!!!

230
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:20,178
Wh... What do you wanna hear?

231
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:22,138
Tell me what you want me to say and I'll say it!

232
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:24,558
Tell me that my friends are all
lying to me and avoiding me...

233
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,773
...because they don't like my parties and
THEY DON'T WANNA BE MY FRIENDS ANYMORE!!!

234
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:31,882
Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you...

235
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:34,378
...cause they don't like your parties and
they don't wanna be your friends anymore!

236
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:36,859
AHA! I KNEW IT!

237
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:42,042
Oh no.

238
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:45,674
My friends don't like my parties and
they don't wanna be my friends anymore.

239
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,826
Uh... So...

240
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,673
Thank you all so much for coming!

241
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,444
It means so much to Gummy.

242
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,755

243
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,551
Well, of course you can have
some more punch, Mr. Turnip.

244
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:15,469

Oh, come one now.

255
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:51,408
"Losers" might be a little strong,
don't you think?

256
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,433
AfTer The wAy tHeY tReAteD yOu?

258
00:16:57,238 --> 00:16:58,763

You know what? I'm not gonna
speak to them ever again.

263
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:15,174
And I'm not gonna invite them
to another party as long as I live.

264
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,436
The don't DESERVE to be invited to my party!

265
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:20,317
Not after the way they've been acting.

266
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,219

Who could that be?

271
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:31,723
Hey there, Pinkie Pie.

272
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:33,912
Sorry I was in such a rush earlier.

273
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:36,237
Had some place to be and
couldn't slow down and say hello.

274
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,575
You know how it goes.

275
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:40,063
I know how it goes, all right.

276
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:44,279
Yeah... So, why don't you come
with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?

277
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,804
No thanks. I'm spending time with my real friends.

278
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:49,700
Isn't that right, Madame La Flour?

279
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,139
oUi! zat is CorrEcT, MadAMe.

280
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,442
Uh... Pinkie Pie?

281
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:56,617
Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?

282
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,078

283
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:03,603
Alrighty. Whaddya say we get on outta
Creepytown and head over to Applejack's...

284
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:05,315
She'S Not gOinG anyWHeRe.

285
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:09,410
I most certainly am not.
I'm having a wonderful time right here.

286
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:11,930
You should really just come with me.

287
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,086

289
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,738
That's it. Party's over.

290
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:22,928
Come on, Pinkie Pie.

291
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:23,720
No!

292
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,283
Pinkie Pie, let's go!

293
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:26,569
I said no!

294
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:31,838
You, ugh... have to... come with... me!

295
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:34,825
No... I... don't!

296
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:43,508
Oh, you want to do this the hard way?
We'll do this the hard way!

297
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,843
We're... here...

298
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:56,595
Surprise!

299
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,634
I really thought she'd be more excited.

300
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,518
Excited?! EXCITED?!

301
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,957
Why would I be excited to attend
my own farewell party?!

302
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:15,878
Farewell party?

303
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:19,100
Yes! You don't like me anymore so you
decided to kick me out of the group...

304
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,297
...and throw a great, big party to celebrate.

305
00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:23,372
A "Farewell of Pinkie Pie" party.

306
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:28,674
Why in the world would you think
we didn't like you anymore, sugar cube?

307
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:29,618
Why?

308
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:31,166
Why?!

309
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:32,760
WHY?!

310
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:36,769
Because you've been LYING
to me and avoiding me all day!

311
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:38,082
That's why!

312
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,919
Uh, yeah. Because we wanted
your party to be a surprise.

313
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:46,042
We've been planning this party
for such a long time...

314
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:48,562
...we had to make excuses for why
we couldn't attend Gummy's party...

315
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,609
...so that we could everything ready for yours.

316
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,523
If this is a farewell party...

317
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:55,349
...why does the cake I picked up
from Sugarcube Corner say...

318
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:57,435
..."Happy birthday, Pinkie Pie"?

319
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:10,629
Because it's my birthday!

320
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,970
Oh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?

321
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:19,958
And you like me so much, you decided to
throw me a surprise party.

322
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:22,928
That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling.

323
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,634
You girls are the best friends ever!

324
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,272
How could I have ever doubted you?

325
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:31,119
It's okay, Pinkie Pie.

326
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,988
It could have happened to any of us.

327
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:39,167
I'm just glad I haven't been
replaced by a bucket of turnips.

328
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,034
Huh?

329
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:41,662
You don't wanna know.

330
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:43,850
Alright, girls! Enough of this gabbin'.

331
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,363
Let's party!

332
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,148
"Dear Princess Celestia."

333
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:57,370
"I am writing to you
from the most delightful party."

334
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,236
"I'm not only having
a great time with my friends..."

335
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:04,489
"...but also was given the opportunity
to learn a valuable lesson about friendship."

336
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,830
"Always expect the best from your friends
and never assume the worst."

337
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:12,904
"Rest assured that a good friend always
has your best interests at heart."

338
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,810
"You faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

339
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:19,552
You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's
after-birthday party too, would you?

340
00:21:19,552 --> 00:21:22,294
His party was cut short and
he's pretty upset about it.

341
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:27,033
Why not? Let's have a party for Gummy.

342
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:33,075
