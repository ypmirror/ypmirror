1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,504
    So in closing, earning a
   rockterate in rock studies

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,307
       from the Equestrian
     Institute of Rockology

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,844
   is no easy feat. I am proud
  of each and every one of you.

4
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:17,449
       Uh, each of... No.
       Just you actually.

5
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:25,391
            Go Maud! Woo-hoo!
         NUMBER ONE! NUMBER ONE!

6
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:28,594
   Fillies and Gentlecolts...

7
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,363
           And is that
     Magnesium-rich Basalt?

8
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:39,104
  It is my honor to present our
   vale-rock-torian, Maud Pie.

9
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,774
    Excuse me. "Doctor Pie."

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,645
     Doctor Pie! DOCTOR PIE!

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,181
         Rock-ter Pie?!

12
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,657
            I'm Maud.

13
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:04,663
     YEAH YOU ARE! BRILLIANT
     SPEECH! ENCORE! ENCORE!

14
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,765
      There's more, Pinkie.

15
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,267
           I'm Maud...

16
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,638
       ... Pie, thank you.

17
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,444
       YOU ARE SO WELCOME!

18
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:22,548
        BRILLIANT SPEECH!
     ENCORE! ENCORE! ENCORE!

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee....

20
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,661
                   You're moving
                   to Ponyville!

21
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,261
             We'll live together
              and get bunk beds

22
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:13,532
          and I'll make us fuzzy
             slippers that say

23
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,731
                 "Best Sister
               Friends Forever,"

24
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,514
  although I probably can't fit
  all those words on a slipper

25
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,013
    so maybe just "B.S.F.F."

26
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,172
        but we don't have
       to decide right now

27
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:20,708
      because we'll be together
         all the time since

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,510
   when it comes to Ponyville,
        THE DOCTOR IS IN!

29
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,479
     Slow down, Pinkie Pie.

30
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:35,886
     You're moving to Ponyville!

31
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,158
I'm not definitely
moving to Ponyville.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,493
              Of course you are,
               silly. You said--

33
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,830
 "There's nothing left to study
   back home on the rock farm,

34
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,166
         so I might move
         to Ponyville."

35
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,703
      I'm also considering
         Ghastly Gorge.

36
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:56,375
Hahahahaha classic Maud sense of
 humor. You should do stand-up!

37
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,244
I do, but that
wasn't a joke.

38
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,181
   GHASTLY GORGE?! That terrible
   awful no-fun all-alone canyon

39
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,150
      in the middle of nowhere?!

40
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,452
There, or Ponyville.

41
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,155
                But Ponyville is
                   so "eeeee!"

42
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,757
               And Ghastly Gorge
              is so... "Urghhh."

43
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,361
It's a rock-based
    decision.

44
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,464
                  But what about
                    B.S.F.F.'s?

45
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,334
That's why I'm giving
Ponyville a chance.

46
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,836
    So all I have to do is prove
     Ponyville has better rocks

47
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,407
             than Ghastly Gorge?
             Challenge accepted.

48
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,442
          We'll drop your stuff
        off at my place and then

49
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:36,549
     hold onto your world cause
    it's about. To. Get. ROCKED!

50
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,050
    OK.

51
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,953
 Ghastly Gorge may have "rocks,"

52
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,556
     but our Gem Cave ROCKS!

53
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,166
Ahhhhh? Ahhhhhhhhh? OH!

54
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:57,736
And look, you never
know who you'll see!

55
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,406
           Maud, darling, it's
        lovely to see you again.

56
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,708
              Congratulations on
               your rockterate.

57
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,344
         What are you doing now?

58
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,446
Talking to you.

59
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,515
           Ah, right. Hahahaha...

60
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,518
       Well, if your trained eye

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,187
                happens to see a
                 chartreuse gem,

62
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,390
                   I'm desperate
                   to find one.

63
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,825
I found one.

64
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,094
                 Oh, you're an
               absolute darling!

65
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,163
      This will surely make
        my gown stand out

66
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,132
at Countess Coloratura's
  album release party.

67
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,468
Do you know how
rare this is?

68
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,103
Just another day
in Ponyville!

69
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,974
        That's actually a
       really common gem.

70
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,075
              Huh?

71
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,815
          These are all
       really common gems.

72
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,949
    They are?!

73
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,253
I mean, come on!
Of course they are.

74
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,956
    That's why I didn't bring
    you here to impress you.

75
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,958
           I wanted to make sure
          you had a chance to...

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,162
               say hello to your
               ol' pal... Spike.

77
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,696
Hello, Spike.

78
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,867
         Way to go, Maud; cross
        that off the to-do list,

79
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,667
               you know what I'm
                sayin'? Check.

80
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,804
 Now let's get moving cause I'm
   about to show you something

81
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,307
               that'll make you
              yell: "ALL RIGHT!"

82
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,442
All right.

83
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,943
          See?! Ha ha!

84
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:19,284
     Ta-da! It's a castle...
         MADE OF ROCKS!

85
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,253
             Whaaaat? Did I just
               blow your mind?

86
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,789
                 I think I just
                 blew your mind.

87
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,892
A lot of structures are
made from rocks, Pinkie.

88
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,628
They're a very stable
building material.

89
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,530
         But this place
       grew out of nowhere

90
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,632
   after a magical key-filled
     gem followed a rainbow

91
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,032
        and buried itself
         in the ground!

92
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,103
      I mean HAVE YOU EVER
      SEEN ROCKS LIKE THIS?

93
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,304
              Yes.

94
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,507
                 NO YOU HAVEN'T!

95
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,776
We literally just saw hundreds
of them in the gem cave.

96
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,548
             But-- but-- OH LOOK
               AT THOSE ROCKS!

97
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,886
      Those are sting-bush
           seed pods.

98
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,723
       So they are. But...

99
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,925
       LOOK AT THAT ROCK!

100
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:03,028
      It's even got four smaller
      rocks around it like legs!

101
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,863
       That's a tortoise.

102
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,235
  WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON, TANK!?

103
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,405
   WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT'S THAT?

104
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,741
       It's a rock shaped
     like Lyra Heartstrings!

105
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:20,079
           TOTAL ROCK!

106
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,558
   I guess you won't be moving
     to Ponyville after all.

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,527
  Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge

108
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,564
      don't know how lucky
      they are to have you.

109
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,499
         Actually, rocks
     aren't the only reason

110
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,202
   I'm considering Ponyville.

111
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,238
You said it's a
rock-based decision.

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,141
        I'm obviously passionate
           about exotic rocks.

113
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,611
              But I've always
          studied them... alone.

114
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,246
             I could handle some
             less exciting rocks

115
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,618
   if it meant I'd have somepony
    to talk to besides Boulder.

116
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,355
Are you saying you
want... A FRIEND?!

117
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,524
      I wouldn't mind one.

118
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:09,661
[gasp]! Maudileena Daisy
Pie, this'll be easy!

119
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,130
What are you looking
for in a friend?

120
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:12,830
Gimme six qualities
assigning each one

121
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,800
a numerical importance rating
between one and seven,

122
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,635
seven being essential
and one being "mehhhhhh?"

123
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,772
        It isn't hard to
      meet somepony I like.

124
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,808
          It's finding
      somepony who gets me.

125
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,509
I get you.

126
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,812
               You're my sister.
                It's different.

127
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,681
Maud. You are THE BEST.

128
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,550
You never know when the
lightning of friendship

129
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,019
will strike! Somepony could
come barrelling through

130
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,988
that door at this very moment
and become your best friend!

131
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,630
    You know I really thought
       somepony was going

132
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,799
       to come barrelling
         through that--

133
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,905
      My fault--totally my
       fault. Are you OK?

134
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,841
   I should have been watching
       where I was going.

135
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,878
   You look really familiar...
       have we met before?

136
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,079
Yes.

137
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,147
                  I knew it--!

138
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,316
             WHAT?!

139
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,018
                  Don't tell me,
                   ummmmmmmmm...

140
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,191
          Yeah, see I was really
           hoping you'd tell me

141
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,759
               while I pretended
                 to remember.

142
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:19,231
   How is this POSSIBLE?! AHH!

143
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,967
I travelled Equestria for my
rockterate dissertation...

144
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,775
             Psst! Do you know a
              lot about rocks?

145
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,878
 Yes.

146
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,947
  Have you ever come across some
   kind of super-powerful stone

147
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,050
   that can store the cutie-mark
      magic of, I don't know,

148
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,552
              an entire village?

149
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,255
Yup. In the big cave.

150
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:54,132
        Hahahaha..hahah.. Hey, I
          got an idea!

151
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,935
   Let's not tell anypony that
  part where you maybe for sure

152
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:00,605
  accidentally helped Starlight
    enslave a town. Hahahaha!

153
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,175
                 Tell. No. Pony.

154
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,211
It's not like she's
enslaved anypony lately.

155
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,080
           Heheheh...

156
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:14,019
   Well, great seeing you again.
   I gotta run a few errands...

157
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,054
Sigh.

158
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,657
                 Offer to help.

159
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,324
  What?

160
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:22,161
                  OFFER TO HELP!

161
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,131
        You want to help?

162
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,631
     Do I?

163
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,667
           Of course you do! Go!

164
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:29,701
     OK.

165
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,975
         They're totally
      gonna be best friends

166
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,777
       and then Maud will
        choose Ponyville

167
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,912
      and we'll get to wear
       B.S.F.F. Slippers!

168
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,755
          Rocks take on
      different properties

169
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,757
  when interacting with magic.

170
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,026
    With the right stone, you
   could rule all of Equestria

171
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,461
        if you wanted to.

172
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,199
You're messing with me.

173
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,334
                      Am I?

174
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:13,979
 Hahahaha... so, other than
 rocks, what else are you into?

175
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:18,850
  Minerals, plate tectonics, oh
 and stand-up comedy of course.

176
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,854
          I like kites.

177
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,827
                 Kites are cool.

178
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,261
       Ah!

179
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,708
  The trick with an SLK is not
  to make the spars too heavy,

180
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,844
       but if they're too
    light you got no ballast

181
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,981
       and then good luck
    tacking against the ALI.

182
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,950
      I really like kites.

183
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,885
They're starting
 to grow on me.

184
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:01,760
    Pizza delivery! Maud and
   Starlight, you're here too?

185
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:06,331
    WHOA what a coincidence,
   cause I was just, you know,

186
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:11,836
         delivering this
      pizza to, um... you!

187
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,143
              So how's it going?

188
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,944
       Just hangin' out--

189
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,813
              Hey, you could use
               this time to bond

190
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,413
        and talk about feelings!

191
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:27,086
   For example: do you "feel"
  like you're becoming friends?

192
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:31,523
  Um. I "feel"... like I don't
  want to talk about feelings?

193
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,923
            Great, I'll go next.

194
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,927
   I feel like I love that you
 two are becoming best friends!

195
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,264
     I mean your friendship
     could be the friendship

196
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,266
         that makes Maud
       move to Ponyville!

197
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,803
     No pressure, Starlight!

198
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,539
Hello? Where'd
  you two go?

199
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,243
Sorry about my sister. There's
no half-excited with her.

200
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,413
      Oh, I know. But she always
        calms down eventually.

201
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,385
         Why do you find
      rocks so fascinating?

202
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:05,056
Each one has a different story
to tell. Like Boulder here...

203
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,326
This tells me he's over
two thousand years old.

204
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,729
You don't look a day
over six hundred.

205
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,465
               Wow. You can tell
               that from a line?

206
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,065
I didn't get
a rocktorate

207
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,602
because I can shred on
guitar like nopony else.

208
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,237
                      Hahahaha.

209
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,774
 Another reason I like rocks...

210
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,843
they don't exclude
you if you're...

211
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,846
         different than
          other ponies.

212
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,514
They're beautiful and strong,

213
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,050
but they don't judge you or
make you feel "less than"

214
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,120
in any way. I think I'm
starting to like rocks too.

215
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,393
          It's hollow?

216
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,463
It's granite. Hollow
granite is highly unusual.

217
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:56,875
     Wow. Have you ever seen
       anything like this?

218
00:12:56,877 --> 00:13:00,545
No. And that's
unusual... for me.

219
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,081
    There you are! I thought
   you went your separate ways

220
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,083
      but you can't imagine
     how happy I am to find

221
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,785
        you both together
         and to witness

222
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,520
       one of your firsts
           as friends!

223
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,261
   Your first time discovering
     an underground cavern!

224
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:19,130
  I can't wait till you're old
 and eating pistachios together

225
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,166
          telling your
     grandfoals about this.

226
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,206
       Oh, no! They're not
     bonding! I GOT AN IDEA!

227
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,816
   Whoaaaa! I'm tripping on a
    rock at this very moment!

228
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,984
    And now I'm falling down!

229
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,256
             Oh, no!

230
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,860
    My accidental clumsiness
      has trapped us here,

231
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,863
where you'll be forced to
bond until we're rescued.

232
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,832
Oh, we don't have
to wait for that!

233
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,200
There's got to be
a spell that--

234
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,534
                   Get us out of
                    here, boy!

235
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,509
Boulder! That...
was... AWESOME.

236
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,879
         No, that was sandstone.

237
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,448
         More sand than
       stone, apparently.

238
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,517
      I'm thinking you wear
     these around your necks

239
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,986
     at all times so I don't
  lose you again, you sillies!

240
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,956
    That way I can track your
      progress as friends!

241
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,060
    Ooh and tomorrow we could
    have a FRIENDSHIP BRUNCH!

242
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,095
What's your favorite
kind of omelette-cupcake?

243
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,898
Mine's jalapeño-red velvet!

244
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,566
                       Uhhhh....

245
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:32,036
       Yeah, um... I don't
     know if I can make it.

246
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,473
You'll change your minds when
you smell the yummy food.

247
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,075
            Come on!

248
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,446
             "Oops."

249
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,018
      Tomorrow's brunch is
    gonna be the scrunchiest,

250
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,487
      brunchiest munchiest
          brunch ever!

251
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,623
Yeah. About that...

252
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,623
           The problem is, while
            you two were alone,

253
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,427
   I couldn't get data points on
  your friendship probabilities:

254
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,929
were you making Starlight smile?

255
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,298
       How was Starlight's
      smile to frown ratio?

256
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,500
       Anything over five
        to one is GREAT!

257
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,970
     Oh, and how many times
    did YOU smile like this?

258
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,906
           Zero times.

259
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,009
             Oh, Maud, don't be
            so hard on yourself.

260
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,378
        You've got the best
   friendship maker in Ponyville

261
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,348
        on the case. I'll be by
       your side the whole time.

262
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,119
         Speaking of which, your
          bell fell off, silly!

263
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:24,222
  Pinkie Pie, I appreciate what
   you're trying to do, but...

264
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:28,126
                        But... ?

265
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,662
           Never mind.

266
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,164
         Don't worry, Maud. When
          you see this brunch,

267
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,534
     you'll realize everything's
           going to be OK.

268
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,671
        And then I have amazing
      bonding activities planned

269
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,706
  for the next seventeen days!

270
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:45,410
     You and Starlight will
     be besties in no time!

271
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,511
                  Goodnight!

272
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,855
       Friendship brunch!

273
00:15:58,757 --> 00:15:59,656
   <i> Maud's voice: Pinkie Pie.</i>

274
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,727
  <i> Thank you for trying so hard</i>
    <i> to help me make friends.</i>

275
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,163
      <i> But my decision has</i>
       <i> to be rock-based.</i>

276
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,732
       <i> And Ghastly Gorge</i>
     <i> has such great rocks,</i>

277
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:11,135
   <i> I won't even have time for</i>
 <i> friends. It's better this way.</i>

278
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,838
        <i> Sorry it didn't</i>
        <i> work out. Maud.</i>

279
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,773
           Maud, wait!

280
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,077
              Maud!

281
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,280
              Maud.

282
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,388
       STARLIGHT, WAKE UP!

283
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,222
             Kites!

284
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,691
                            Huh?

285
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:37,462
    If this is about brunch,
     I uhh... you know what?

286
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,431
  Jalapeno red velvet omelettes
   sound gross; I just can't.

287
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,034
Maud left in the
middle of the night!

288
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:46,504
       Oh, I guess Ghastly
     Gorge really does have

289
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,339
         the best rocks.

290
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,410
Why couldn't you
two just be friends?

291
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,779
                 Pinkie Pie... I
                   like Maud.

292
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:55,780
    You do?

293
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,882
       Yeah, she's weird.

294
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:58,983
Hey!

295
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,386
       No, in a good way.

296
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,654
      She sees the world in
     a totally different way

297
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,790
   than anypony I've ever met.

298
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,159
  She accepts me for who I am.

299
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,294
      She taught me that a
    rock is never just a rock

300
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:13,264
and she can make anything funny!

301
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,601
   And we never had to say it
    but... we got each other.

302
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,137
         You really were
        becoming friends?

303
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:24,542
      I think so, but you kinda,
        sorta...got in the way.

304
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,114
        You're right. Too
      harsh. Let's go with:

305
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,650
     "You ruined everything
         all the time?"

306
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:37,255
    Ngh... that's worse. What
     I'm trying to say is...

307
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,390
I-have-to-go!

308
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,428
        Ta-da. Friendship
       lesson... learned?

309
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,829
             Sigh.

310
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,276
                   Sorry.

311
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,424
Emerald-Jasper. This
must be my lucky day.

312
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,707
          Maud tracks!

313
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,184
      Hello, Pinkie Pie. I
      found Emerald-Jasper.

314
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,686
             AHHHH!

315
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,128
Are you OK, Maud? That
eel almost ate you!

316
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,862
            What eel?

317
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,437
        You didn't need to come.

318
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,706
              I'm having a great
                time on my own.

319
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,176
       I even made a new friend.

320
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,477
Is it a rock?

321
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,612
                      Yes.

322
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,717
              Maud!

323
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,353
I don't belong
 in Ponyville.

324
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,256
It only proved I'm
better off all by myself,

325
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,324
like I always have been.

326
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:25,530
          DON'T SAY THAT! It was
          all my fault! I-- LOG!

327
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,832
     I thought I knew everything
        about making friends.

328
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,268
              But I didn't even
             know my own sister.

329
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,203
                I forced you to
               do things my way,

330
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,439
      but my way isn't your way.

331
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,841
This way.

332
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,743
                    Exactly.

333
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,345
No, this way.

334
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,387
  Maud. I thought you couldn't
 make a friend without my help.

335
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,623
 But it turns out, you couldn't
   make a friend with my help.

336
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,960
               I underestimated
              you and I'm sorry.

337
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,929
I know you did
it out of love.

338
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,232
You're my Best Sister
Friend Forever.

339
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:10,308
       OH MAUD, I LOVE YOU
   BIGGER THAN ALL EQUESTRIA!

340
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,943
         And you melt my
        heart more easily

341
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:15,580
        than sodium-rich
      plagioclase feldspar.

342
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,615
                  I don't know
                what that means,

343
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,318
            but please-please-
          please -please- PLEASE

344
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,453
                 give Ponyville
                 another chance.

345
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:26,290
         But more importantly,
       give me another chance...

346
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,859
             to leave you alone.

347
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,628
  What do you
think, Boulder?

348
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,836
You're back!

349
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,938
             Mm hm.

350
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,906
For good... ?

351
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,406
                          Mm hm.

352
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,810
  This doesn't mean we need to
  start talking about feelings,

353
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:46,911
                   does it?

354
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,113
    No way.

355
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,818
      Maybe after this, we could
        decorate my new place.

356
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,287
         Totally. Where
             is it?!

357
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,023
                 Well, it's not
                 in Ponyville...

358
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,992
                ... more like
             Ponyville adjacent.

359
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,435
                   It's perfect.

360
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,438
    YES! MY SISTER'S TOTALLY
      STAYING IN PONYVILLE!

361
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,973
        I MEAN PONYVILLE
            ADJACENT!

362
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,975
           Ahh ha ha!

363
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,748
  Sorry, sorry, I'm leaving. I
   promise. I'm not even here.

364
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,383
       EEE, you're wearing
          the slippers!

365
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,485
       OK, now I'm really
          leaving. Bye!

366
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,355
             Heh heh. Wrong way.
