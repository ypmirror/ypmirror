425
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,953
    An infection that spreads
     to those around you!

426
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,322
         I watched it
         infect my hive.

427
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,390
    I will NOT let it get ME!

428
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,258
   Same!

429
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,459
                  Obviously.

430
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,996
     But... Grogar said we
     have to work together.

431
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,432
     Grogar is too powerful.

432
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,901
        Something must be
        done about that...

433
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,105
     Let Grogar think we're
     his loyal servants.

434
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:45,043
     In the meantime, we'll
      hatch our own plan.

435
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:48,579
Ooo. I love a good
backstabbing!

436
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,414
After that, we can go back

437
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,883
to trying to..
destroy each other.

438
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,453
      In the meantime, what
       do we do with this?

439
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,258
       You failed to
       retrieve the BELL?

440
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,427
                We're sorry,
                Almighty Grogar.

441
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,997
       We worked together
       as you asked!

442
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,599
We just aren't as
powerful as you!

443
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,902
             [roar]

444
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,804
             [crash]

445
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,806
           Obviously!

446
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,108
            At least you finally
            did as you were told

447
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,609
            and worked together.

448
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:20,979
   Of course!

449
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,847
      Whatever you command.

450
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,849
Forget about
that old bell.

451
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,719
You were right!

452
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,888
We're SO much more powerful
when we work as a team...
