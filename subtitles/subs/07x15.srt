1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,236
       Is the banner even?

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,873
    Are the flowers in place?

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,075
       ...by which I mean
     completely out of view.

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,414
      I'm pretty sure
  dragons don't like flowers...

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,983
  And what about the ceremonial
Dragon-Fire Flame of Friendship?

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,184
      Is it still flaming?

7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,055
Spike, everything
looks great!

8
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,191
You're getting yourself
worked up for no reason.

9
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,059
     I have lots of reasons!

10
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,162
   In fact, I wrote them down.

11
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:32,231
 Uh.. You've been hanging around
     Twilight for too long.

12
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:32,932
Heh...

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,031
       Reason number one:

14
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,368
      I invited Dragon Lord
    Ember to Ponyville today.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,838
     Reason two, the Dragon
        Lord is a dragon.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,941
 Reason three: she's coming here
 to learn more about friendship.

17
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:43,375
  According to Ember's letters,

18
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,277
         the dragons are
      trying to be friends,

19
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,777
        but competing is
         in their nature

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,780
       and it's leading to
      more and more fights.

21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,483
       Which brings me to
       reason number four:

22
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:53,052
The Dragon Lord wants my advice!

23
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,487
    And as the new official
Equestrian Friendship Ambassador

24
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,857
       to the dragons, I
       can't let her down.

25
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,725
        I know you feel a
        lot of pressure,

26
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,493
   but you've got this, Spike.

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,529
              I...

28
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,564
       I just want things
         to be perfect.

29
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,637
[gasp!] Thorax... you're in Ponyville!

30
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,372
     Of course I am, silly!

31
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,975
 You invited me and I'm not one
  to back out of an invitation.

32
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:17,976
                  Hey, Twilight.

33
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,011
                 Hey, Starlight.

34
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,713
   Twilight: Heyyy...
   Starlight: Hello....

35
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,313
          Thorax: Oooh!

36
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,883
       I can't believe you
      did all this for me!

37
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,018
          Great banner!

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,553
         Love the stage!

39
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,288
    What's this flame thingy?

40
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,822
        Oh, it's pretty.

41
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,726
You invited Thorax
over to Ponyville

42
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,261
on the same day as Ember!?

43
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,863
           Apparently...

44
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,999
               That doesn't seem
               like a good idea.

45
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,134
How are you going to
entertain them both?

46
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,969
         I have no idea!

47
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,380
       I completely forgot
          Thorax wrote

48
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,582
   and said he needed to talk
  and I told him to come over.

49
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,185
   I didn't realize it was the
    same day I invited Ember!

50
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,486
       What am I gonna do!?

51
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,989
       Well, maybe they'll
        like each other?

52
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,589
          Probably not.

53
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,894
       Ember is tough and
 self-assured and intimidating.

54
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,394
        And Thorax is...

55
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,964
Spike, I'm so glad
you invited me.

56
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,167
You are one of my closest,
nicest, most caring,

57
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,603
       most understanding
          friends ever.

58
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,307
Oh! Is that ice in the
shape of a dragon?

59
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,707
                Yeah, I see
                your point.

60
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,043
                 They might not
                 get each other.

61
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,279
Or worse, they'll
hate each other.

62
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,647
And if the leader of the
Changelings and the Dragon Lord

63
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,783
get into a fight...

64
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,052
I could be responsible
for starting a war

65
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,154
that could ruin
Equestria as we know it!

66
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,965
                   I'm sure that
                   won't happen.

67
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,267
         Now, pull it together.

68
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,905
         So... Thorax...
    everything good with you?

69
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,974
 Well, honestly, no, not really.

70
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,444
     I have indigestion, not
   sure if it's the new diet,

71
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,646
  or stress or maybe it's both.

72
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:35,815
               No!

73
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,183
 Yeah. It really could be both.

74
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,585
And it might be affecting
my sleeping, too.

75
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,554
Twilight: Uh oh..
Thorax: I'm a real tosser and
turner these-

76
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,590
              Sounds like you
          really need to unwind!

77
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,427
                Er.. how about a er.. a trip
                 to the castle?

78
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,395
You can't miss that view!

79
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,097
                Yes, the castle!

80
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,099
                 I'll give you a
                 personal tour.

81
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,838
       Are.. aren't you coming?

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,208
 Yeah...I'm just gonna grab some
 ice cream for us and catch up.

83
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,943
            Heh heh.

84
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,026
    Dragon Lord Ember, as the
 official Equestrian Friendship

85
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,562
 Ambassador for the Dragonlands
       and for Ponyville,

86
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,498
     I, Spike of Ponyville,
        welcome you to...

87
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,933
           Ponyville.

88
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,436
       I gotta work on my
        official speech..

89
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,771
           OK. Thanks.

90
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,642
Heh heh.. right. The hug thing...

91
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:38,644
              Heh heh.

92
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,147
 This place has a lot of colors.

93
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,350
In the Dragonlands, everything's
 just rocks or the color of ash.

94
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,451
             ACHOO!!

95
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,988
      That's probably why..

96
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,125
  Hey, Twilight!

97
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,196
    Actually, I'm Starlight.

98
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,198
       Starlight Glimmer.

99
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,066
               Nice to meet you.

100
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,402
   Oh, sorry.

101
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,137
I'm.. really gonna have to get
used to these pony names.

102
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,073
        Lots of "lights"
        and shiny things.

103
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,410
      Er.. so where is Twilight?

104
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:12,611
      She's in her castle--

105
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,211
               OH!

106
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,511
We should go visit her then.

107
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,782
Part of friendship is saying
 hi to your friends, right?

108
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,049
             Uhh...

109
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,318
       well yeah.. but...

110
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,422
You're making weird noises.

111
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,957
Do you have a stomach ache?

112
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:28,026
  [gasp] I think I feel one coming on..

113
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,297
Well, you know what us dragons
say: push past the pain.

114
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,465
          Now let's go!

115
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,701
Or.. we could stay here.

116
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,969
      Or I could go without you.

117
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,574
                Heh heh heh. Ah.
                   I like her.

118
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:43,498
Oh..

119
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,949
     Good, they're not here.

120
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,149
What was that?

121
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:57,055
            Uh, I...I said, it's
             all clean in here!

122
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,727
       Er.. you must be hungry
       from your travels.

123
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,096
   Please, I'd love to present
      you with an official

124
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,331
   Friendship Welcome Banquet.

125
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,776
So this is something friends do?

126
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,345
I could get used to this.

127
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,781
                 Actually that's
                    not food...

128
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,116
Dragons love gems.

129
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,651
    Fine, but you're telling
     Twilight what happened

130
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,553
          to her wall.

131
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,389
       Just keep her here.

132
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:37,262
         OK, yeah, enjoy
   all the crystal... things..

133
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,564
Where are you going?

134
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,266
I thought this was an
official friendship banquet.

135
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,201
       Just gotta use the
      little dragon's room.

136
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,307
       So this is my comfy chair
         for fictional reads.

137
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,745
    This is my studying chair

138
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,681
        because the hard
      back keeps me awake.

139
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,153
Oh, Spike! I'm so
glad you're here.

140
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,923
This castle visit
is getting weird.

141
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,325
Twilight really likes chairs.

142
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,330
Oh. What happened to the ice cream?

143
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,666
        What? Oh, right!
        Uh, they ran out.

144
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,737
  Hey, I'm really sorry, but I
 gotta borrow Twilight quickly.

145
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:21,215
Wah!

146
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:23,842
         Be right back!

147
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,444
 But we didn't get to talk yet!

148
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:29,882
          Ember's here!

149
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:33,218
    I know; I saw you coming
   and had to distract Thorax

150
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,419
     by showing him chairs!

151
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,556
   Why did you bring Ember to
    the castle of all places?

152
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,056
          I don't know!

153
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,693
Ember was asking for you, Thorax
    wants to talk with me...

154
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,395
    we need to switch places!

155
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,130
          They might be
       getting suspicious!

156
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,067
 All we have to do is make both
  Thorax and Ember feel special

157
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,236
       and keep them apart
      for a few more hours.

158
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,704
         We can do this.

159
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,008
      Ah! What's happening!?

160
00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:58,532
     Ah..!

161
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:03,849
      I think it's the map!
      It's calling... you!

162
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,818
  Apparently, you also have to
   solve a friendship problem.

163
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,826
     The map is calling me!?

164
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:19,699
             Oh... amazing! The map is
            really reaching out!

165
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,867
                Not a good time,
                    I get it.

166
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,169
Starlight: Spike, are you here?

167
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,905
      Ember's eaten all of
  Twilight's decorations and--

168
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,407
        Oh! Hey Twilight. Heh...

169
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,046
 Glowing map.. [gulp] glowing spikes...

170
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,082
                That's not good.

171
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,316
             I KNOW!

172
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:41,954
    At least your friendship
    problem is in Ponyville?

173
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,156
      OK, OK, to pull this
     off, I'm going to need

174
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,225
      both of you to help.

175
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,193
You two need to keep
Ember and Thorax separate

176
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,561
 while I
 get ice cream.

177
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,130
You mean find the
friendship problem.

178
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,331
                     Yes....

179
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,566
                  Go easy on me.

180
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,401
                 I'm under a lot
                  of pressure!

181
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,771
       Friendship Problem?

182
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,073
          Anypony got a
    friendship problem here?

183
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,775
     Any problems to solve?

184
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,444
      Friendship problems?

185
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:10,048
      Friendship Problems!

186
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:13,852
          Anypony got a
    friendship problem here?

187
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,687
             No? OK.

188
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,226
Uch. Well I think vanilla
strawberry cream is overused!

189
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,127
                          Hmph.

190
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,328
Yes! Fighting!

191
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,598
Uh, I mean, what seems
to be the problem?

192
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,207
      Ember, there you are!

193
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,910
OK... right,
more pony hugs.

194
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,012
              How's your trip to
               Ponyville so far?

195
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,915
Well, I'm certainly learning
a lot about friendship.

196
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,417
I had no idea it was polite
to decorate your walls

197
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,986
in your friends' favorite foods.

198
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,057
       Heh heh. Oh, my...

199
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,092
Where'd Spike and Starlight go?

200
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,327
I feel like I'm being avoided.

201
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:57,229
Hmph.

202
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,832
     No! They're just making
   sure everything is perfect

203
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,267
  for your welcome party later.

204
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,336
   In the meantime, how about
     I show you around town?

205
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,536
          Sounds good.

206
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:08,406
      I can't exactly learn
        about friendship

207
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,774
  if I don't make new friends.

208
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:19,285
         Oh!

209
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,800
                   Uh.. Hey Thorax...

210
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,122
   Um. Twilight and Spike had some
    boring official paperwork

211
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,992
   to deal with, so looks like
   you and I get to hang out.

212
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,360
   What would you like to do?

213
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,261
 But I wanted to
talk with Spike.

214
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,563
He said he'd be right back.

215
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,200
     Oh you will, but first how
  about we grab a bite to eat?

216
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,837
Huh. Well you know, now that you've said
it, I am a little hungry.

217
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,538
Is there a dining
room in the castle?

218
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,707
                    NO!

219
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,511
            ... I mean yeah, but
             that's castle food.

220
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,446
        If you want the good
     stuff, we gotta go to town.

221
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,486
  ... and that's why you should
    never let cupcake flavors

222
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,855
        get in the way of
        your friendship.

223
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:01,025
  Huh. I guess I never thought of it
    that way. Thanks, Spike.

224
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,630
       Oh, come on! Glow!

225
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:06,465
Thorax: Spike!

226
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:07,966
There you are!

227
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,435
Done with your boring
paper work I see.

228
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,271
            Ha ha ha...! A-huh.. A-huh..?

229
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,809
  Yup, heh heh. I am done with whatever
  Starlight says I was doing...

230
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,511
Thorax wanted to get
out of the castle.

231
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,249
I thought coming to town was
a really, really great idea.

232
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,851
Well! Maybe now we can talk.

233
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,521
              Ssssure.

234
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,521
      I'll leave you guys to it.

235
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:35,093
First of all, I want to say
thank you for having me over.

236
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,995
I'm in a bit of a
leadership pickle

237
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,595
and I could use
some advice.

238
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:42,834
 Well, I definitely want to help
 you out as quickly as possible.

239
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,537
Here's my problem: there's this
renegade group of changelings

240
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,239
who still feed off of love.

241
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:52,010
Even though I said, "Hey, let's
not do that anymore," they say,

242
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,212
"Hey this is how we've
been doing things

243
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,413
     for hundreds of years-"

244
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,382
    -but it's like they don't
       want to even though

245
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,017
      I'm the leader and I
        asked politely...

246
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:08,692
             Hello!

247
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:13,031
 I am Ember, daughter of Torch,
 winner of the Gauntlet of Fire

248
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,533
    and lord of all dragons!

249
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,307
   Usually when I do that, the
  dragons are eager to meet me.

250
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,909
   That's not how
ponies make friends.

251
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,679
Ahh... I get it.

252
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,951
This is a weird friendship
thing you ponies do, right?

253
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,027
                Uh... you guys
               are in town, too?

254
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,295
 What are you
talking about?

255
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,097
You've been with
me this whole time.

256
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,399
              No, I'm Starlight.

257
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,437
           Riiiiight.

258
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,572
       I'm sorry, but you
         can't blame me.

259
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,741
        You both look and
       act so much alike.

260
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:57,843
              Both: What!?

261
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,780
    And they said to me just
   keep saying the same thing.

262
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:05,049
 You know I think my leadership
 problems started in childhood.

263
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,518
  I must've been three when ...
  Three's a different story --

264
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,918
       and you definitely
         gotta hear it,

265
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,623
     but the story about my
  brother was when I was two...

266
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,191
          Or was I one?

267
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,459
                This is my seat!

268
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,560
                 I saw it first.

269
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,662
Well, I got here first.

270
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,965
 Thorax, excuse me for a second.

271
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,135
         Ponies, please.

272
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:29,874
  If I may, I think I can help
 solve this.. friendship problem.

273
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,345
  You two should sit together.

274
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,180
  You both like the same place;
    you both ordered muffins;

275
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,180
       you're both ponies.

276
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:38,849
       I think if you made
        a little effort,

277
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:39,885
       you'd find that you
        have a .... whoa!

278
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,588
  OK, that had to have done it.

279
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,356
      Come on spikes, glow!

280
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,495
Hey, that was
really great advice.

281
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,763
So what do you
think I should do?

282
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,636
  Actually, I uh need a minute.

283
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,507
      Alone. To really come
      up with great advice.

284
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,441
             I'll be right back!

285
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,844
[sigh] Great. No problem.

286
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,645
Leave me again...

287
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,114
     It's fine....

288
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:14,086
  I'm just saying, you're both
 purple ponies with purple hair.

289
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,156
    You both have cutie marks
     with sparkle-y things.

290
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,526
Heh. Mine's more of
  a glimmer..! Heh.

291
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,662
          How is that different?

292
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,597
                Oh, good, Spike.

293
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,932
             Can you please tell
            these two I'm right?

294
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,634
         They look very similar.

295
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:33,871
    Er.. Well, you know, one thing
 friends do is let something go

296
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,640
       when it's upsetting
         somepony else.

297
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,240
         But I'm right.

298
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:40,411
   Besides, who are you to be
  telling me about friendship?

299
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,281
                I've barely seen
                  you all day!

300
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,450
Uh.. well.. I've seen you...

301
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,618
      Are you calling me a LIAR!?

302
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,622
Hey! No one yells
  at my friend!

303
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,964
  Spike, get away from the bear!

304
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,368
Actually the bear's a changeling
     and he's quite gentle.

305
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,903
Not anymore!

306
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,082
  Aaah! My worst fears are happening!

307
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,425
               NO!

308
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:29,694
Huh. Back away, Spike, I'm not
going to let this dragon

309
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,096
harm a scale on your back!

310
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,466
     You back away! I'm not
   going to let you harm him!

311
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,969
    Wait, did you say you're not
     going to let me harm Spike?

312
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,104
              Yeah!

313
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,705
   But that's what I'm doing.

314
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,540
              Uh..what?

315
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,176
                     Yeah, what?

316
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,412
Ahh.. Equestria as we know it is over!

317
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,213
        The war that pits
    changeling against dragon

318
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,381
       is about to begin!

319
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,781
     And it's all my fault!

320
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:54,653
     My title of Equestria's
Friendship Ambassador is a lie--

321
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,922
        Oh. Hey. You guys
        aren't fighting?

322
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,658
    Why would we be fighting?

323
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
     Because I accidentally
        invited you both

324
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,229
        over to Ponyville
        on the same day?

325
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,198
         Both: So what?

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,001
        So, I was trying
       to keep you apart,

327
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,303
        because I didn't
     think you'd get along.

328
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,707
          Oh, I get it.

329
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,409
 You thought he wouldn't like me
    just because I'm a dragon

330
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,111
   and I'm bad at friendship?

331
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,714
  No! No! Of course not! But...

332
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,050
        Wait, isn't that
        why you're here?

333
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:29,320
I can say I'm bad at friendship;
   you can't say it about me!

334
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,456
          You know what? I don't
          want to talk about it.

335
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,358
         Wait, please...

336
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,627
        [sigh] I'm sorry.

337
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,962
No, no. It's cool.

338
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,498
You thought I'd be too soft
and someone like Ember

339
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,668
would never respect me, just
like my own changelings.

340
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,436
       No, that's not it!

341
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,605
          Thorax! Wait!

342
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,740
             Oh, no.

343
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,475
        What have I done?

344
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,952
Why are you still here?

345
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,456
[sigh] Because I'm having
trouble leading my pack.

346
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,426
So I don't really
want to go home.

347
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,161
     Wait, you're in charge?

348
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,598
       Ho boy, you need to
       be more assertive.

349
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,035
That's my problem,
I don't know how.

350
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,371
  I tried asking them to please
      follow my directions

351
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,506
       and I even offered
          a prize and--

352
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,175
              SHH! Stop talking.

353
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,145
           That's how you do it.

354
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,281
     Whoa. That just
     gave me chills.

355
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,116
                 I know you have
                   it in you.

356
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,285
             You turned into a
           bear to defend Spike.

357
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,255
Huh. I guess I can be tough when
I'm defending my friends.

358
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:42,060
But.. when I'm just enforcing my
rules, I feel unsure of myself.

359
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,262
       There's nothing to
          be unsure of.

360
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,064
        You're the leader
          for a reason.

361
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,399
       Make a decision and
         let it be known

362
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,935
   that the decision is final.

363
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,537
       And if that doesn't
     work, turn into a bear.

364
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,406
That's good advice.

365
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,675
                   I know it is.

366
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,777
So what's your deal?

367
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,879
Why do you think you're
so bad at friendship?

368
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,713
                I don't want to
                talk about it.

369
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,549
Oh, you have to.

370
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,184
How else are you gonna
solve your problems?

371
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,189
    Through feats of strength
   and fire duels, of course.

372
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,057
             Hiyah!

373
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,497
    Uh... how did that help?

374
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,332
        Crushing another
      dragon in competition

375
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,069
    establishes my dominance
    and makes me feel great!

376
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,872
Right, but how do
you think they feel?

377
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,840
      Humiliated! Ashamed!

378
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,210
    They probably want to run
    away and bury themselves

379
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,244
       under a rock and...

380
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,113
       ... never come out.

381
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,881
      They're probably sad.

382
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,183
           Kinda low.

383
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,985
      Definitely not happy.

384
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,388
That's because that kind of
competition can divide you.

385
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,790
And it doesn't get to
the heart of the issue.

386
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,160
Talking about your
feelings does.

387
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,094
             A-Achoo!

388
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,664
            Ach. I think I'm allergic
                to feelings.

389
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,502
You know you don't have to  be
sappy or huggy-feely about it,

390
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,405
but you should let your
friends know how you feel.

391
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:03,007
                  Ah.. I know where
                   we can start.

392
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:04,743
   Where?

393
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,145
    Oh. Spike. Heh.

394
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,212
   I got there.

395
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,191
               ♪♪

396
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,417
      I think they're gone.

397
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,519
       They probably never
      want to see me again.

398
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,588
                Or ... they want
                 to see you now.

399
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,325
Guess what, Spike?

400
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,994
     I know. I'm so sorry--

401
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,663
     LET ME TALK ABOUT THIS!

402
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,565
    I feel...

403
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:30,201
   ... mad.

404
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,472
               OK.., that's a good
                first attempt.

405
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,041
        Now maybe try to
        be more.. specific?

406
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,113
             I'm...

407
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,414
             ugh...

408
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:44,749
             upset!

409
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,350
   You have every right to be.

410
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,752
I KNOW I DO!

411
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,555
And I know I need to
tell you how I feel

412
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:54,125
because my friend, Thorax, said
it would make me feel better.

413
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,593
                   AND IT DOES!

414
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,296
             Yeah! And I have no
             problem telling you

415
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,530
                    what you did
                      was wrong

416
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,132
                     because my
                    friend Ember

417
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,733
                is helping me be
                 more assertive.

418
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,169
              Whoa.

419
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,637
                         Nice!

420
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,772
                   Ha ha!

421
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,775
  You guys should be mad at me.

422
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,044
     I was so worried about
     how it could go wrong,

423
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,179
    I didn't even think about
     how it could go right.

424
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,849
       Can you forgive me?

425
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,685
                     I really do
                    feel better.

426
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,187
             So, yeah. I'm good.

427
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,822
             Heh. Me too.

428
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:29,134
Oooh..

429
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:30,995
                  Ohhh.. again?

430
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,267
 No way! It's finally happening!

431
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,936
 I solved a friendship problem!

432
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,271
Actually, you created
the friendship problem

433
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:41,706
  by not trusting your friends.

434
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,509
Yeah, but then I solved
it by learning my lesson.

435
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,744
       I should have told
         my two friends

436
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,346
  about each other immediately,

437
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,581
       instead of assuming
    they wouldn't get along.

438
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,083
        Good job, Spike.

439
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,485
Is this another part
of pony friendship?

440
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,554
Telling each other what
you learned all the time?

441
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,523
Yeah, pretty much!

442
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,091
                  Yep!

443
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,563
         Spike: So! As a
         show of unity,

444
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,132
    I present the Dragon Fire
       Flame of Friendship

445
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,834
    to both Dragon Lord Ember

446
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,403
      and Thorax, Leader of
      the Changeling Pack.

447
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,073
   May the Flame of Friendship
       burn for eternity.

448
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,112
             A-Achoo!

449
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,820
You should have more
things made of rocks.
