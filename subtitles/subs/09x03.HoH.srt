00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,581
   changing and adapting to be
    whatever Equestria needs.

423
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,183
                 A cool place
                 to hang out?

424
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,819
    Something tells me
     this is more than that.

425
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,488
 It seems the Elements of
  Harmony may still be with us

426
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,690
        in their own way.

427
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,660
              Ah! That's actually
              really reassuring.

428
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:06,130
  But why did the Tree need OUR
  help to become something new?

429
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,799
I'm not sure. If I had to guess,

430
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,903
   I'd say your friendship is
  more powerful than you know.

431
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:17,208
Oh, Yona know. Yona just
need to remind friends.

432
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,810
So, who's going to
give us the tour?

433
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,812
    [everybody hems and haws]

434
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,280
   [giggle]

435
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,083
Why don't we all
go in.... together?
