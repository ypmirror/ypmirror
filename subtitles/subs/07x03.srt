1
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:05,312
Oh, Princess Twilight,

2
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:07,868
everypony at the
hospital is so excited

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:09,044
for your visit today!

4
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:12,644
I'm never too busy to visit
sick foals! I can't believe

5
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:15,656
a whole class just came
down with the Horsey Hives.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,176
... on school
picture day, too!

7
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:24,484
Oh! The poor dears really
do need cheering up.

8
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,928
We'll do our best!

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,912
We'll bring snacks; I'll read
to them and get them gifts.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,892
Food and presents
always cheer me up!

11
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:36,448
We'll see you soon.

12
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:41,588
OK, if we want to be at
the hospital by lunch,

13
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:43,928
then we have three hours
to buy get-well presents,

14
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,408
borrow a book from
the schoolhouse

15
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,496
and pick up treats.

16
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:50,556
It's a lot, but if we
stick to the schedule,

17
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,404
I know we can get
it all done.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,128
Yeah, knock on wood!

19
00:00:58,076 --> 00:00:59,788
Surprise!

20
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:03,396
Oh, my gosh!

21
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:07,108
How's my
favorite niece?

22
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:11,284
I'm good! I was hoping
my favorite aunt

23
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:13,492
could watch me for
a few hours!

24
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:14,984
I hope you're
not too busy!

25
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:16,944
Actually, we kind of are--

26
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:20,996
Busy? Psh! Would the Best
Aunt Ever be "too busy"

27
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:23,548
to spend time with this
adorable little one?

28
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:26,828
No!

00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:14,572
Flur-ry, I've got
a surprise for you!

31
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:24,348
Just a couple of toys that
reminded me of Flurry!

32
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,064
I'm excited to show you

33
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,104
I've done some shopping
for Flurry Heart!

34
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:38,944
You're so sweet. You
didn't have to do all that!

35
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:41,108
I know, but I
can't help myself!

36
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,688
Best! Aunt! Ever!

37
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:45,996
Open this one, Flurry!

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,780
Exactly! They're bears!
You're one smart cookie!

39
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,768
We'll just put Flurry's
things over here, Twiley!

40
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:32,264
Uh huh, totally!

41
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,940
Mashed peas:
her favorite.

42
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:41,408
And diapers, extra diapers,
oh and backup extra diapers.

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,000
Mashed peas: her favorite.
Wait. Did I say that already?

44
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:48,596
Uh-huh.

45
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,172
Whoops.

46
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:54,156
Oh! And this is the most
important thing of all!

47
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:55,292
Her "whammy".

48
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:57,868
I take it Flurry named it?

49
00:03:58,264 --> 00:04:01,324
Yup. If she gets fussy,
just give her the whammy

50
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,936
and she'll calm
right down.

51
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:04,908
You getting all
this, Twiley?

52
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,060
Whammy! Got it!

53
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,188
Where are you guys
headed anyway?

54
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:12,588
You remember my friend from
the royal guard, Spearhead?

55
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:17,956
Honestly, all of your friends'
names are very similar.

56
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,364
Well, he has a pop-up art
show at the Ponyville Cafe

57
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,388
and we decided to go
at the last minute.

58
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,672
We're not exactly
art enthusiasts

59
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,828
but we could really
use a night out.

60
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:29,128
You mean day?

61
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,276
That's what I said.
Isn't that what I said?

62
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,336
Either way, are you
sure you can watch her?

63
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:38,736
Uh uh uh!

64
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:46,448
Have no fear! The Best-Aunt-Ever
has everything under control!

65
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:52,088
Thanks again, Twiley!

66
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,884
OK, let's grab that
wharmmy thing and go!

67
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,300
Ooh, you wanna pretend
we're the bears?

68
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:06,116
I suppose we have
time for a quick game.

69
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:09,284
Do we though?

70
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:10,668
Hey!

71
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:13,812
All right, rawr!
I'm gonna getcha!

72
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,096
Agh!

73
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:21,360
You should catch her soon
cause we've got lots to do!

74
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,232
Horsey-hive covered foals
counting on us, remember?

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:32,324
Got it. Rawr, rawr!
I'm catching up! Rawr!

76
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,608
RAWWWWWR!

77
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,652
Uh oh. Sorry, bug.
Did that scare you?

78
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:49,104
It's OK! It's just
Auntie Twiley!

79
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,288
You know, that was a
very advanced spell

80
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:59,740
for somepony your age.

81
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:03,064
Looks like you're already taking
after your Auntie Twiley!

82
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:11,244
All right, that was pretty
adorable. But now--

83
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,044
I know, Spike. We're leaving.

84
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:18,036
I just have to feed
her real quick.

85
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:43,516
Is this art...
or a mistake?

86
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:45,136
I have no idea.

87
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:48,064
But who cares? We're
not changing diapers.

88
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:52,420
Shining Armor! Cadance!
How are the new 'rents?!

89
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:53,744
Give me some hoof!

90
00:06:56,268 --> 00:07:02,232
It is so! Good! To see you
dudes! Thanks for coming!

91
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:05,048
Of course! We're
having a great time!

92
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,220
Loving all the art!

93
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,052
Uh, that's a trash can.

94
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,536
So it is. I knew that!

95
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,732
But hey, who's to
say it's not art?

96
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,564
Art can be anything
that speaks to you.

97
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:22,040
It changed my world.

98
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:29,304
This is my latest piece: A
Thousand Nights in a Hallway.

99
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:33,952
Wow, I guess nighttime in a
hallway can be pretty dark.

100
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,844
There is none more dark.

101
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:38,152
Yeah. Totally.

102
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,520
We're just so happy to be here!

103
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:44,016
Usually we're covered
in mashed peas by now.

104
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,284
When they said mashed
peas were her favorite--

105
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,920
--did they mean her favorite
thing to decorate a room with?

106
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,672
Aw, come on, Spike.
That wasn't too bad!

107
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,340
Yeah and we're only twenty
minutes behind schedule.

108
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:11,560
Twenty minutes? It's fine.
We can totally do this.

109
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:23,380
OK, we just need to grab some
toys and we are out of here!

110
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,708
Rawrr!

111
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,456
You want to play, don't you?

112
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:36,152
Well, I know a game
that's even more fun...

113
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,684
and more efficient.

114
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,188
Playing race cart! Ha ha!

115
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:46,228
Woohoo!

116
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,256
Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!

117
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,628
Best-Aunt-Ever!

118
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:59,608
Hang on, Flurry. The race
cart's taking a pit-stop.

119
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:23,376
I'm not a detective, but
I think we've got a suspect.

120
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:24,364
Ah!

121
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,504
Well, we'd better
get to cleaning.

122
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,020
We've got no
time to waste!

123
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,523
Thanks, but they were
organized by color.

124
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:50,912
Yes! We gained back a whole
five minutes from running here!

125
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:53,420
Yeah, but if you add
that to the 40 minutes

126
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:57,830
we were already behind, we're
still... 55 minutes behind.

127
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,468
I mean... yay, team?

128
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,492
Mmhmm!

129
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:07,436
Thanks for helping us out,
Cheerilee! Sorry we were late.

130
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,017
Oh, no problem!

131
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:11,296
But I gotta say, I'm
surprised you came to me

132
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,297
for a book. Don't you
have a huge collection?

133
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:18,793
Yes, but...
sorry, one second--

134
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,585
I didn't think the
foals would be interested

135
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:32,016
in The Unabridged History
of Amulets in Pony Latin.

136
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:34,470
Yeah. It was good
you came to me.

137
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:36,246
How about the
complete collection

138
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:38,684
of "Ponyville
Fables and Stables"

139
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:41,990
Mm, too long.

140
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,001
"Alien Alicorns
vs. Space Pirates"?

141
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:47,094
Well, the science
there is preposterous.

142
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:49,148
How about Burnferno:
Warrior from Within?!

143
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:52,265
It's about a handsome dragon
warrior who slays evildoers

144
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:55,084
with his breath and
his snappy comebacks!

145
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,547
Let's borrow that for you
and keep looking. What else?

146
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,561
How about "Gusty
the Great"?

147
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,904
Ooh! That was one
of my favorites

148
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,926
when I was a filly!
We'll take it!

149
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:21,868
Um... should I go with
something more current?

150
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:24,876
<i> ♪ Ta da! ♪</i>

151
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:29,526
Cheerilee! I am so, so sorry.
I didn't even hear her leave.

152
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,432
There! All clean!

153
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:44,928
Great. Now I'll just write
it up again. With my mouth.

154
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:49,296
Feast your eyes.

155
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:52,764
This one's called 'A
Kitchen Guard's journey'.

156
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,355
Oh...

157
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:56,166
This reminds me
of the time

158
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,316
Flurry got into the
chocolate pudding

159
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:02,352
and we found little chocolate
hoofprints all over the carpet.

160
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,771
That took forever
to clean up!

161
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,004
But remember how cute
her little face looked

162
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:08,320
when we caught her?

163
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:11,360
Yeah she was
like... uh oh!

164
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,075
Whoa! Art is
so evocative.

165
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:18,067
I wasn't even going
for that memory! Score!

166
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,883
Honestly, Twilight, I
don't even want to tell you

167
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:23,868
how late we are.

168
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,060
Should I just cancel our
visit to the hospital?

169
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:29,568
What? Cancel? We
can't cancel, Spike!

170
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,616
The sick foals are
counting on us!

171
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:34,992
And the B.A.E. would never
throw in the towel like that!

172
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,681
B.A.E.?

173
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,355
Best-Aunt-Ever!

174
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,713
Besides, this errand is
going to be different!

175
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:42,540
How do you figure that?

176
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,995
Because Flurry can play
with the Cake twins

177
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,715
and stay out of
trouble! Best Aunt Ever!

178
00:12:57,392 --> 00:12:59,507
Wonderful, they're
friends already!

179
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,312
Huh! I shouldn't
have doubted you.

180
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,798
Thanks. Wait,
you doubted me?

181
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:07,798
Spike, you watch Flurry; I'll
take care of everything else.

182
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:12,707
Hi Pinkie, how's it going? I
need to pick up the cupcakes

183
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:14,966
for the foals at the hospital
and can you do apology treats?

184
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:18,041
I'm good. Here they
are. Of course I can!

185
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:21,219
Do you still have a giant file
of everypony's favorite treat?

186
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,969
In my secret party
planning cave.

187
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:25,856
BRB!

188
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:32,188
He he! Remind me to tell you
later how amazing you are.

189
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:33,020
Cheerilee?

190
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:34,758
I am pretty awesome.

191
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,561
Cherry oatmeal cookies
with yellow sprinkles.

192
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,179
Great! Can you write
"sorry" on them?

193
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,894
I've got a stamp for that.

194
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:02,230
Hey, you guys.
no need to fight.

195
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,036
Hang on! I'm sure
there's another one!

196
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,160
Hold on, sweetie!
We'll play in a second!

197
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,278
The salespony at
the toy store.

198
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:34,876
Apple strudel cupcake
with caramel drizzle!

199
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:47,401
Oh, no. You're making the
same face Cheerilee made.

200
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,723
Pinkie, remind me what
your favorite treat is.

201
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:58,966
The sampler platter.

202
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,460
We'll take
three of those.

203
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:04,777
A-ha! told you I'd
find another one.

204
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,824
Heh heh.

205
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:13,926
Uh, Twilight!

206
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:16,665
Out of the question! We
are NOT cancelling!

207
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,540
It's going to be
OK! It has to be OK!

208
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,814
It's been so
terrible so far

209
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:21,670
that it can't possibly
end up [splat]

210
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:24,156
Sorry.

211
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:27,929
No, I needed it.

212
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:30,480
I was just gonna
say... we're here.

213
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:35,836
And we're only
four-and-a-half minutes late!

214
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:36,886
Four-and-a-half?

215
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:41,478
"And while nopony had ever
tried to reach Cloudsdale

216
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:44,176
on hoof, Gusty the
Great was not deterred.

217
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,049
She and her unicorn warriors
marched up the hill--

218
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:49,286
but suddenly they encountered--"

219
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,596
What?! What was it?!

220
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:54,857
"It was the
treacherous Grogar!

221
00:15:55,043 --> 00:15:57,417
And Gusty could tell he
was ready for battle.

222
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,137
Gusty called out to
the unicorn warriors--"

223
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:00,864
OW!"

224
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:05,014
Not right now, Flurry, these
foals really want to hear this.

225
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:09,616
"'We can fight
Grogar... TOGETHER!'

226
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,395
And the unicorn warriors shot
magical beams into the clouds

227
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,036
that wove into one.

228
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:18,454
The beam, stronger than a
thousand armies, shined down.

229
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:21,507
It wrapped around Grogar and
pulled him to the ground.

230
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:23,708
Don't let him escape!'
yelled Gusty!"--

231
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,843
Say aaaaah!

232
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,528
Aaah!

233
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:45,488
"Grogar was strong,
for fear gave him power

234
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:47,808
and he broke
through the bonds--"

235
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:54,480
I know! So good, right?!

236
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,926
Twilight! Look up!

237
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:58,598
Spike! You're floating!
YOU'RE FLOATING!

238
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,952
So are you!

239
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,217
Flurry, honey, you
need to stop this.

240
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:07,974
Get us down, please!

241
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:09,884
Twilight, look out!

242
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,003
Nopony panic! Everything's
going to be OK!

243
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,995
Ah! I can't keep up with her!

244
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:44,892
Oh, yeah! Where's her snoozal?

245
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:45,814
Her what?

246
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,476
You know her, whacky,
wompy-thing, the snail!

247
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,691
Where is it? Cadance
said it calms her down!

248
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:51,734
I don't see it!

249
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:05,321
FLURRY HEART! PUT US
ALL DOWN THIS INSTANT!

250
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,390
Is everypony OK?

251
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:18,617
Flurry that was
very, very bad!

252
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,080
You could have
hurt somepony.

253
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:26,976
Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to--

254
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:31,264
Sweetie, you don't have to be
scared; it's just me. See?

255
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:36,425
You're scared of me.
Because I yelled at you.

256
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,364
Like a big scary bear.

257
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:42,172
Flurry, I'm so sorry. I've
been a terrible aunt today.

258
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,428
All you wanted to do was play

259
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,110
and I've barely been able to
pay attention to you.

260
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:50,092
None of this is your
fault. It's mine.

261
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,748
So much for being
the Best Aunt Ever.

262
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:55,104
But I hope you know
how much I love you.

263
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,502
I take it you forgive me?

264
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,332
Thanks, Flurry. How
about we head home?

265
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:07,392
After we find your
whammy, of course!

266
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:08,646
Ahem!

267
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,465
And clean up.

268
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,489
This one kind of reminds
me of Flurry's hair.

269
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,680
And this one reminds
me of Flurry, too.

270
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:24,748
How so?

271
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,724
It's small, like her.

272
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:29,939
I can't do this
anymore.

273
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:32,323
Spearhead, this has
been great but--

274
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:33,228
Say no more.

275
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:36,604
My art has always spoken
to me about what I love,

276
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,545
but knowing that it spoke
to you about what you love,

277
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,200
speaks to me.

278
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,288
What?

279
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:43,628
Go to her!

280
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:04,736
Flurry? Where's our
little foal?

281
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,624
We missed you so much!

282
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:20,054
But it looks like you had
a great time without us.

283
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:23,854
Actually, not so much. Flurry
got into some mischief.

284
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:25,568
But it wasn't her fault.

285
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:27,446
I shouldn't have
agreed to watch her

286
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,260
with such a
jam-packed schedule.

287
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,334
It was too much
to juggle.

288
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,025
But Flurry taught me an
important lesson today.

289
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,544
It turns out being the
Best Aunt Ever

290
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:39,056
isn't about spending the
most time with your niece,

291
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,481
but spending quality
time with her.

292
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:44,681
And she taught me a
really cool "bear" game,

293
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:46,774
so I guess I learned two things.

294
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,627
Well, we definitely
should have given you

295
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:53,942
more of a head's up.

296
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:57,526
Yes! From now on, we'll
give you plenty of notice.

297
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,532
That would be great!

298
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,510
Hey, what are you doing
next Tuesday?

299
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,320
For dinner! Not to babysit.

300
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:08,761
I'll have to check with Spike,
but I think we're free.

301
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,828
Where is Spike, anyway?

302
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:13,248
"... the dashing dragon warrior

303
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,680
breathed a scorching
flame from his snout

304
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,401
then chuckled to himself
as he flew into the sunset.

305
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,113
'If you can't stand the heat,
don't fight a dragon..'"

306
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,583
Hey, you kinda
look like him!

307
00:21:26,064 --> 00:21:26,998
Thank you.

308
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:29,267
OK. Now who wants more cake?!
