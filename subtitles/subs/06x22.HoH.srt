to be the favorite food

347
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:07,235
of the Tri-horned Bunyip. And
bubbles, followed by a swell

348
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,450
is what happens when they
swim up to the shallows

349
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,600
from deep water!

350
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:15,815
So, we attracted a tri-horned
whatchamacallit...

351
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,210
With cucumber
sandwiches?

352
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,540
Sounds like a stretch.

353
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,530
Hello, Bunyip, sir.

354
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,250
So that's a...

355
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:32,710
A Tri-horned Bunyip...

356
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:34,870
Who's very sorry
he accidentally

357
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:36,995
knocked over your
boat, right?

358
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,020
Wait; the storm had nothing
to do with the capsizing?

359
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,345
Nope.

360
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,790
All right. Even if our friend
the Bunyip is responsible

361
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,810
for sinking the boat,

362
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,850
that still doesn't excuse
a certain pony's behavior.

363
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,430
Me!? How about you
and Pinkie Pie?

364
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:56,565
Pfft! Wha-?! How- ME?--

365
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,490
Twilight: I think I can
explain that too.

366
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,005
Each one of you spent so
much time trying to come up

367
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,460
with the perfect way
to get the others

368
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,555
out of their element,
that you didn't notice

369
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,335
your friends were
doing the same thing.

370
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:11,100
Wait a minute. You brought all
those games and things for us?

371
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,400
Of course! I figured the boat
trip was the perfect time

372
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,330
to do things that
were silly and fun.

373
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:19,430
And I was just trying
to give the two of you

374
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:21,855
the elegant cruise I
thought you deserved.

375
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:25,355
And I just wanted to give you
two a high seas adventure,

376
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,005
since that'd be something
new and different for y'all.

377
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,975
OOOOHHHHHHH.

378
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,135
That is so sweet.

379
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,280
You must have gone
through so much trouble.

380
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,750
Well, not half as much
trouble as you did

381
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:41,290
making all that fancy food.
And bringing all those games.

382
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,400
I guess this just teaches us
that even longtime friends

383
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,165
need to work at communication.

384
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,400
Well, there's something
I'd like to communicate

385
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:49,785
to you all right now.

386
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,395
You girls are the best friends
a pony could ever have.

387
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,080
Oh, let's never
fight again!

388
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:57,100
Agreed.

389
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:57,850
You've got it!

390
00:20:58,205 --> 00:20:59,445
[growl]

391
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,680
All right, you big
softy. Bring it in.

392
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:10,865
Come on, Bunyip,
sir. You've got it!

393
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:19,825
♪♪

394
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,485
One thing's for sure, Spike.

395
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,370
There's nothing like a
luxurious adventure boat party

396
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,325
to get you out of your element.

397
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,100
Spike: You said it!
