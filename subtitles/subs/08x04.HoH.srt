422
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:56,327
even if I don't exactly have
what it takes to be a shop pony.

423
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,096
I wouldn't sell
yourself short.

424
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,598
Those salespony characters
all came from you.

425
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,001
Yeah. I think you totally
 have what it takes.

426
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,370
Maybe a little too much.

427
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,472
                     Indeed.

428
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,774
          You have all the inner
            strength you need,

429
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,776
                 but I think we
                prefer it coming

430
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,545
               from our sweet,
             regular Fluttershy.

431
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,580
    [giggles]

432
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,285
  And that's just given me the
  inspiration I'm looking for!

433
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,957
And last one...there!

434
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,226
The missing piece for
my new collection:

435
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,828
The Warrior of
Inner Strength!

436
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,435
        [excited chatter]

437
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:40,405
            Gorgeous!

438
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:45,109
  Oh, it's lovely, Rarity. I'm
   just sorry you had to leave

439
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,512
       the Canterlot Royal
       Fashion Show early.

440
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:51,149
 Oh, darling, making the perfect
 dress is scads more satisfying

441
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,617
      than showing it off.

442
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:56,521
        [excited chatter]

443
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:00,091
     Ooh. Striking dress, Rarity.

444
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,026
   I certainly hope you aren't
   trying to undercut the

445
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:05,996
  Royal Fashion Show by ducking
   out and debuting it here.

446
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,632
         What? No, I-I--

447
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,634
Have you considered
the possibility

448
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,270
that the Royal Fashion Show is
trying to undercut Rarity's

449
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,038
by continuing on
in Canterlot

450
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,507
and not moving the
whole affair here?

451
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,709
Hm? HAVE YOU? HM?

452
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,412
           I, uh, no.

453
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,815
    Hmph! Just as I thought.

454
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,420
Oh! [giggle]
Inner strength.

455
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,822
[laughter]
