00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:09,586
Oh, good morning little friends,
your singing is oh so pretty.

2
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:12,326
Yes, it is a very
beautiful day today,

3
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:14,826
certainly something
worth singing about.

Oh, thank you so much.
You're too kind.

15
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:03,116
<i>WOW!</i>

16
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:11,088
Oh. You um, you didn't
hear me, um ...

17
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,673
Singing in the most
beautiful voice ever?

18
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:15,456
Uh, yeah we did!

19
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:30,800

20
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:03,593
Wow! I've never heard you
sing a solo like that before.

21
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:06,396
It was like a little
slice of heaven.

22
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,633
With ice cream on top!

23
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,912
Fluttershy, I cannot believe
your spectacular voice

24
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:15,228
isn't part of the
Pony Tones Quartet!

25
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,622
Um...well...I...

26
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:19,408
Especially since you're
having us perform

27
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:22,019
for your Ponyville Pet Center
Fundraiser tomorrow night!

28
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,934
Well, you see, I...

29
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:27,219
This simply must be rectified!

30
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,824
You must share that
stunning voice at the event.

31
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,936
Yeah! It will be so amazing!

32
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,793
You'd be there on stage,
basking in the hooflights,

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,076
the center of attention,
a shining star...

34
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,979
<i>With everypony staring</i>
<i>at you, judging you,</i>

35
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,529
jealously noting how they
could be WAY better than you.

36
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,632
Why wasn't it them?
Why wasn't it them?

37
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:48,035
<i>And then, when you choke,</i>
<i>they'll turn on you</i>

38
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,660
becoming a seething angry mob

39
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,388
and you'll be horribly
humiliated,

40
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:54,582
never able to show your
face in Ponyville again!

41
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:58,393
Pinkie Pie! Don't
be ridiculous!

42
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,700
But I'm so good at it!

43
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:02,844
Come, Fluttershy.

44
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:06,025
You will join the group making
the Pony Tones Quartet

45
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:08,112
the Pony Tones Quintet!

46
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:09,360
No!

47
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,024
Pardon me?

48
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:13,174
I love the Pony Tones.

49
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:14,934
I'm one of their biggest fans.

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,424
But I do not want to
perform with them.

51
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,286
Why not, Fluttershy?

52
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:26,729
Well you see, I...I
have...um...I-I have...

53
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:27,644
Spit it out!

54
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:31,126
I have...stage fright!

55
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:33,692
Is it contagious?

56
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,297
Stage fright isn't
a disease, Pinkie.

57
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:38,806
It just means that Fluttershy
is scared to perform

58
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,884
in front of everypony.

59
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,016
I'm very thankful
the Pony Tones

60
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,961
are singing at the Pet
Center Fundraiser.

61
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,646
<i>And I'm really looking</i>
<i>forward to the performance.</i>

62
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:49,564
But I'll be watching
safely from the audience.

63
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:54,288
Well, I think it's a terrible
waste of an exquisite talent,

64
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,563
but I understand that
you're not comfortable.

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,993
Thank you.

66
00:03:58,675 --> 00:03:59,881
Ooh! Angel's right!

67
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:00,995
We better get going!

68
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,817
There's a lot of work to
do before tomorrow's event!

69
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:17,318
Ahem!

70
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:20,713
All right, Pony Tones, let's
run through that again!

71
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:35,228
♪ Everypony's saying you should
<i>learn to express your voice. ♪</i>

76
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,451
Whoo hoo! Yeah!

77
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:56,265
Rarity, you were awesome!

78
00:04:57,148 --> 00:05:00,230
Thank you, Spike, but
this is an ensemble.

79
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,249
Enh, the rest of you
were pretty good, too.

80
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,240
Oh, I thought you were all
amazing, Pony Tones.

81
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:09,804
Thanks, Fluttershy!

82
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:12,800
Now, Pony Tones, I want you
all to rest your voices

83
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:13,843
for the remainder of the day.

84
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,326
We'll do a final run-through
tomorrow before the big event.

85
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,075
All right?

86
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:17,897
Eeyup.

87
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:19,180
Sounds great!

88
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:22,793
Oh, Rarity, the Pony Tones
are really going to make

89
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:25,747
the Ponyville Pet Center
Fundraiser so special!

90
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:29,472
Thank you so much for
helping me help the animals!

91
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:32,665
Oh yes. It is wonderful
when a plan comes together

92
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:34,822
without any sort of
drama, isn't it?

93
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,100
Morning, Fluttershy.

94
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,331
Good morning,
Pony Tones!

95
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:02,819
Actually, we're the Pony
Tones minus one tone.

96
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,392
Big Mac is
inconveniently late.

97
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:12,985
Well, there you are!

98
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:15,062
Have I not told you
about punctuality?

99
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,456
Ah! I don't want
to hear it!

100
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:32,422
Big Mac! Can you please
start the song?

101
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:35,292
Nnope.

102
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:36,214
Big Mac!

103
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:37,664
Did you lose your voice?

104
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:39,536
Eeyup.

105
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:48,380
Whatever did you
do to cause this?

106
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,041
Well...

107
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:53,161
Howdy, everypony!

108
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:56,521
And welcome to the 12th Annual
Ponyville Turkey Call!

109
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,708
Who will take the
title this year?

110
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,251
Will it be somepony new?

111
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:06,710
Or will the Turkey Call
champion of six years

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,672
<i>defend his title to make</i>
<i>it lucky number seven?</i>

113
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,715
We'll find out if
ya stop yer gabbin'

114
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,034
and git on with
the gobblin'!

115
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,507
All right, everypony!

116
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:19,203
Let's talk turkey!

117
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:21,459
Big Mac, yer up!

118
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,979
A Turkey Call?

119
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:31,577
You lost your voice
doing a...Turkey Call?

120
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:33,952
Lost his voice and the title!

121
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,690
Now we can't
perform tonight.

122
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:40,729
Wait! What? No!

123
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:43,372
You have to perform!

124
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,006
Otherwise the fundraiser
will be a disaster.

125
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,848
Well, we cannot perform
tonight with only three voices.

126
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:50,089
Why not?

127
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,486
It would take rearranging
all the music

128
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,673
and we just don't have time.

129
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:56,073
<i>I'm sorry, Fluttershy,</i>
<i>but I have no remedy</i>

130
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,094
<i>for this situation.</i>

131
00:07:58,937 --> 00:07:59,977
Of course!

132
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:01,001
A remedy!

133
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:02,060
Follow me!

134
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:11,244
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

135
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,192
Hmmm.

136
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,336
Aaahh.

137
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:18,835
I can cure this
pony that is hoarse,

138
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,700
but it will take
a longer course.

139
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,979
Come again?

140
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,846
Hmmm.

141
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,672
I can mix a brew that
will work just right,

142
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,841
but it cannot heal
him by tonight.

143
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:30,896
Oh no!

144
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,734
Where are we ever going
to find a deep voice

145
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,308
to replace Big Mac's?

146
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,852
Pardon me, Zecora,
but this is no laughing matter.

147
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,088
We need a bass voice for
the harmonies to work!

148
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:45,290
Without it, the
performance will be ruined!

149
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,827
Please forgive my
strange elation,

150
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:51,129
but I was not laughing
at your situation.

151
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,038
Then what?

152
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,686
Remember when you pony folk
stumbled into Poison Joke?

153
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:59,180
<i>Miss Fluttershy had</i>
<i>an unusual change,</i>

154
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,216
<i>deepening her vocal range.</i>

155
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:03,545
I don't want to
talk about it.

156
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,390
Yes, yes!

157
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:09,510
Your voice became really
low, making it sound like...

158
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,427
Flutterguy!

159
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,112
With these leaves,
I can mix a brew

160
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:16,665
creating the same
effect on you.

161
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,990
Zecora, that's fantastic!

162
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,713
Yes! I'll do it!

163
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,328
I'd do anything for the animals!

164
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:26,086
Why, you'd even
appear on stage!

165
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:27,888
Oh, except that.

166
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:31,961
I just can't bring
myself to sing on stage

167
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,324
in front of everypony.

168
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,358
What if you sang NOT
in front of everypony?

169
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:39,350
Huh?

170
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,752
What if Big Mac was on
stage moving his lips

171
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,151
while you're behind the
curtain singing his part?

172
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,051
It would be just like
singing in your house.

173
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,817
<i>Nopony would know it was you.</i>

174
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:53,449
Even still. I just don't think
I could sing in front of--

175
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,689
You must! For the animals!

176
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:03,798
Oh, OK, then...mix it up.

177
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:13,782
Now do it just
like we practiced.

178
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:28,192
Good evening,
citizens of Ponyville!

179
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:30,608

Prob'ly hidin'.

185

You know how much that
pony hates the spotlight.

Pony Tones! Pony Tones!

206
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,446
Pony Tones!

207
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,182
That was truly amazing!

208
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:33,798
And you sounded better
than ever, big brother!

209
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,456
Fluttershy, you were on the
wrong side of the curtain!

210
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,166
You totally missed the show!

211
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:45,968
Just like a true professional,
Fluttershy was back stage

212
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,926
making sure everything
ran smoothly.

213
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:49,795
And it was perfect!

214
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:53,440
That was fantastic, Pony Tones.

215
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,374
My new puppy and I thought it
was super duper crazy good!

216
00:12:57,203 --> 00:12:58,684
Why, thank you!

217
00:13:01,827 --> 00:13:04,035
And we were wondering if you
would consider performing

218
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:05,888
at my daughter
Zippoorwhill's Cuteciñera.

00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:08,579
We'd love to!

Oh, gracious, I'm
terribly sorry.

225
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,160
That's just much
too last-minute.

226
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:19,520
Oh no!

227
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,092
Well...I understand.

228
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:29,318
Oh, Rarity.

We can't disappoint
that sweet little filly.

at my ribbon-cutting
ceremony tomorrow!

241

Oh, Mayor, we would
love to but...

242
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,436
Will you excuse us
for a second, Mayor?

Certainly.

Don't
worry, Fluttershy.

You don't have to
perform again.

But we wouldn't
want to disappoint the Mayor.

her dream in the shadows

289

because she couldn't
bring herself

to come into the

Yes.

297
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:43,613
I'm here.

298
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,893
<i>That was totally</i>
<i>unbelievable!</i>

299
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,486
I mean, the curtain came
up, and there you were,

300
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,413
singing in front of everypony!

301
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:52,480
And, you know, I don't think
any pony was jealous

302
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,853
cause there certainly
wasn't an angry mob!

303
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,300
But it must have been horrible
standing there on stage!

304
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,040
All eyes glued directly on you.

305
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:03,293
It's like you were living your
own personal worst nightmare!

306
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:06,493
It was!

307
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,973
What? Too much?

308
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,720
What Pinkie meant to say was
that you were really great.

309
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,026
Wait! Didn't I say that?

310
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:21,273
Hardly!

311
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:22,113
Whoops!

312
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,160
YOU WERE GREAT!

313
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:27,133

my mind!

314
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,440
Incredible!

315
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:34,753
Though, no offence, you
kind of sounded like a dude.

00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:39,486
A great sounding dude!

317
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,560
Well, thank you all.

318
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm glad you enjoyed it...

319
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:51,313
...because I'm never going to
sing in front of anypony

320
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:52,500
ever again.

321
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:54,340
Oh no!

322
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:55,480
Are you kidding me?

323
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,940
Can we please
stop running!

324
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,440
I just don't understand
why, Fluttershy.

325
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,260
<i>After all, you're the one</i>
<i>that wanted the Pony Tones</i>

326
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:10,346
to sing for every silly
thing that was requested of us.

327
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,593
You mean, you knew I
really wanted to perform?

328
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:15,500
Of course I knew!

329
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:16,926
Oh.

330
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:20,666
And for all her babbling, Pinkie
Pie was right about one thing.

331
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Only one?

332
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,426
When that curtain fell, and
everypony saw you singing,

333
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,073
you lived your worst nightmare.

334
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:30,760
Was it really that bad?

335
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:32,386
Yes!

336
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,533
Well, what was so bad about it?

337
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,346
The thunderous
applause?

338
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:38,493
The praise for your
fantastic singin'?

339
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:41,453
The SCREAMING FANS?

340

You did it,
Fluttershy!

353
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:41,746
See? That
wasn't so bad.

354
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,146
And you didn't look completely
petrified by the fact

355
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:45,800
that we're all staring
at you at all!

356
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,153
How do you feel?

357
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,766
Surprisingly OK!

358
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:52,993
<i>Fantastic!</i>

359
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,706
Because the Pony Tones
have been booked for the

360
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,826
Apple Family's Zap Apple
Jam Extraordinaire!

361
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,013
Oh no! I couldn't
do that!

362
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:06,346
Why not?
How come?
Seriously?

363
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:08,353
I'll get there someday.

364
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
But for now, baby
steps, everypony.

365
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:12,260
Baby steps.

366

368
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:22,246
