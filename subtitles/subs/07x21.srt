1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,773
        OK! Let's see how
        your still-life's

2
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,508
   comin' along, Kettle Corn.

3
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:14,947
      Well, that certainly
          is... round.

4
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,482
     I can make it rounder.

5
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,685
      I'm afraid that's all
     the time we have today.

6
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,253
       We'll try something
         else tomorrow.

7
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,155
   But I like circle-painting.

8
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,591
   And on the way to figuring
  out what you're meant to do,

9
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,727
        you'll find a ton
      more stuff you like.

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,029
  That's what makes looking for
    your cutie mark so great.

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:31,930
Mmmhmmm!

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,405
        Sorry everypony,
     we're closin' up shop.

13
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,840
 Glad to help you out tomorrow.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,775
             Awwww!

15
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,213
     I don't know if we can
       help them tomorrow.

16
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,717
    Working with blank flanks
  one at a time takes forever.

17
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,752
       If only there was a
        way we could help

18
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,454
         a whole herd of
          'em at once.

19
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,822
That would be perfect!

20
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,224
We'd save time and they
could help each other.

21
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,260
      Just like we used to!

22
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:02,928
     Aw, but it'd have to be
      somewhere big enough

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,964
       to handle all those
          blank flanks.

24
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,899
      Somewhere outside...

25
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,901
          with tons of
       activities to try!

26
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,237
      Are you two thinking
       what I'm thinking?

27
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,605
      CUTIE MARK DAY CAMP!

28
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,474
   And I know just the place.

29
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,743
   Applejack used to go there
      when she was little!

30
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,711
                CAMP FRIENDSHIP!

31
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,446
               Oh.

32
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,346
             Sorry.

33
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,482
      I thought we were all
    gonna yell that one too.

34
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,999
   Attention all blank flanks!

35
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,168
   And blank flank affiliates!

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,103
        Come to our Cutie
          Mark Day Camp

37
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,572
        to find out what
      you're truly good at.

38
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,842
  Bond with other blank flanks

39
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:25,344
    and find out what you're
      meant to do together!

40
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,315
           Hey Rumble!

41
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,717
       Oh, hey, Crusaders.

42
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,918
       Look, I can't stop.

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,519
  Gotta meet my brother for...

44
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,621
               ...something.

45
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,956
No problem! Just wanted
to make sure you heard

46
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,625
about our Cutie
Mark Day Camp!

47
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,026
The first session's
     tomorrow!

48
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,733
         Uh whatchya got
     there, little brother?

49
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,301
What? Oh. Nothing.

50
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,670
   Come on. I wanna show you a
    new dive roll I'm trying.

51
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,708
 Scootaloo: Come one, come all!

52
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,679
   Cutie Mark Day Camp is for
   blank flanks of all kinds!

53
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,147
             Hmm...

54
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,717
   Welcome Cutie Mark Campers!

55
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,353
    Who's excited to be here?

56
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,554
             We are!

57
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,723
            Whoo hoo!

58
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,525
    Well, we're excited too!

59
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,960
     At Cutie Mark Day Camp,

60
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,429
      you'll be able to try
      all kinds of things.

61
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,597
    Kayaking!

62
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,066
       Scootaloo: Horseshoe tossing!

63
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,569
        Circle painting!

64
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,672
    You can try 'em all, but
    the most important thing

65
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,008
        is that you'll be
      trying them together.

66
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,508
   That's what worked for us!

67
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,212
  Thunderlane: Then I bet it'll
 work for these little guys too!

68
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,383
      I thought you said we
     were gonna go practice

69
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,353
      for the Wonderbolt's
  Ponyville extravaganza show.

70
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,589
I'm going to
Wonderbolt practice.

71
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,991
You're going to
cutie mark practice.

72
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,559
   And we're glad to have you!

73
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,265
    I can't believe your own
    brother is a Wonderbolt.

74
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,636
       Uh, Rainbow Dash is
      practically my sister

75
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,537
  and she's a Wonder Bolt too.

76
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,009
      Do you know Spitfire?

77
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,478
        I know she'll be
        mad if I'm late!

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,214
       Now you have a good
    time and try some stuff.

79
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,882
         Who knows what
       you'll be good at?

80
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,653
         Wow!
       My goodness!

81
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,391
 All right! Looks like we found
the first activity of the day...

82
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,293
       the horseshoe toss!

83
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,427
            Whoo hoo!

84
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:27,132
   Well, wish I could stay and
   play, but it's time to fly!

85
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,233
            Have fun!

86
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,671
              Whoa!

87
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,376
         C'mon, Rumble!

88
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,444
       Step on up and show
        us how it's done.

89
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,549
       No way he's as good
         as his brother.

90
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,586
           Eh. Whoops.

91
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,688
      Aw, guess I won't be
      getting my cutie mark

92
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,457
     in the horseshoe toss...

93
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,258
               Don't worry about
                  it, Rumble.

94
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,328
      Hardly anypony finds their
       calling on the first try.

95
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,029
      Eh. I wasn't worried.

96
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,466
Good! 'Cause there's a ton
of other stuff to try!

97
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,367
    We'll find you something
         you're good at!

98
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,583
              Whoops!

99
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,228
                      Whoopsie.

100
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,340
              Whoops.

101
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,748
    The first and last lines
      have five syllables,

102
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,317
    but the middle has seven.

103
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,718
      It's called a haiku.

104
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,494
    Whoops. I've tried it all.

105
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,564
     Time to tell my brother
     this.. camp isn't for me.

106
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,734
        Come on, Rumble.

107
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,936
 Isn't it fun just trying stuff?

108
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,270
           Not really.

109
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,077
              Yeah!

110
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,245
           All right!

111
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,481
        Haiku cutie mark!

112
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:27,252
     And I never would have
    tried without Skeedaddle.

113
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,122
That's what Cutie Mark
Day Camp is all about.

114
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,758
      Working together and
       helping each other!

115
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,496
         But I can still
        come back, right?

116
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,298
  And maybe paint some circles?

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,532
Of course!

118
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,434
Let's all meet right
back here tomorrow.

119
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,768
             Hooray!

120
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,740
  Wow. I can't believe we got a
  cutie mark on the first day!

121
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,077
      Yep. This camp was a
       pretty swell idea.

122
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,945
 Everypony's really enjoyed it.

123
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,082
    Everypony except Rumble.

124
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,950
       He didn't have much
       luck with anything.

125
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,620
 Trying to find out what you're
 meant to do can be frustrating.

126
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,423
  You remember how long it took
   us to get our cutie marks?

127
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,392
   I remember the nightmares.

128
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,761
Well, we can't let Rumble
quit camp just because

129
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,930
he didn't find something
he's good at yet.

130
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,033
 We'll just have to convince him
  to come back and try harder.

131
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,167
             Mm hmm!

132
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,078
                    Hey. Rumble!

133
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,779
What are you all
doing here?

134
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,181
   We just wanted to apologize
    for not finding anything

135
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,316
        you liked today.

136
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,019
Oh. Whatever. It's fine.

137
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,156
 It's not fine! It's frustrating
   and we know what it's like.

138
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,892
I'm not frustrated!

139
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,794
                 It's OK. We've
                 all been there.

140
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,629
               But we won't give
              up on helping you.

141
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,598
              We know you'll get
               your cutie mark.

142
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,999
                 Everypony does!

143
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,068
        Actually, I don't
         need your help

144
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,003
      because I don't want
      to get my cutie mark!

145
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,138
              What!?

146
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,543
I-I must have
hay in my ears

147
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,179
because I thought I
just heard Rumble say--

148
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,249
    You heard right! I don't
     want my cutie mark!

149
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,149
               [gasp] He said it again!

150
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,823
     Not wanting a cutie mark is
    like not wanting to breathe.

151
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,859
Everypony wants to know
what they're meant to do.

152
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,327
      Hmph! Not this pony.

153
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,596
              WHY?

154
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,399
       Because Cutie Marks
        are silly and...

155
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,402
  and they just force you into
   one thing your whole life!

156
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:24,904
          That's silly.

157
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:28,073
   Having a cutie mark doesn't
 mean you can't do other things.

158
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,975
Yeah! Our cutie marks
are in helping ponies

159
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:31,977
with their cutie marks,

160
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,846
but I still like making
potions with Zecora.

161
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,616
      And when was the last
       time you did that?

162
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:41,620
Um...I-I-I think it was... uh...

163
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,123
Well, we've been pretty busy
helping other ponies lately--

164
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,427
  Oh. You mean doing the thing
  you got your cutie mark for?

165
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,597
  The thing you're stuck doing
   for the rest of your life?

166
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,500
   OK, maybe we will be doing
  that more than anything else,

167
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,003
        but we love being
      Cutie Mark Crusaders!

168
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,540
 Well, that's fine for you, but
 I'm not gonna be put in a box!

169
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,277
    A blank flank who doesn't
       want a cutie mark?

170
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,080
  That's gotta be the strangest
     thing I've ever heard.

171
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:12,317
 Granny always says, some ponies
   have to find their own hay.

172
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,687
     Are you sure she didn't
   mean "find their own way?"

173
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,689
         Huh. That would
        make more sense.

174
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,158
  I can't believe Rumble isn't
   interested in getting

175
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,495
   his cutie mark either, but
     we can't force him.

176
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,664
      And we've got a whole
       camp full of ponies

177
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,399
       who are interested
         in cutie marks.

178
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,733
            Mmm hmmm!

179
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:35,941
              Yeah!

180
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:40,812
Here he comes, the fastest, most
   elite flyer in Equestria...

181
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,447
     THUNDERLANE!

182
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,782
                 Uh! Whoa!

183
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,686
       Eh.. I was gonna say me.

184
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,055
   You're not the only pegasus
    in the family, you know.

185
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,624
        Aw sorry, little
     brother. You're right.

186
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,160
You might be the most elite
flyer in Equestria someday,

187
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,696
but for now, you should
try other things too.

188
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,265
Speaking of which, aren't
you supposed to be at camp?

189
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,100
              Pfft.

190
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:03,568
That camp is for losers
who can't do anything.

191
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,570
 Great. So there's no pressure.

192
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,874
You can try everything and not
be worried about looking bad.

193
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,341
   I'm not worried about that!

194
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,777
        I just don't want
       to get a cutie mark

195
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,645
         in any of their
     ridiculous activities.

196
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,715
Well, you're still
going back tomorrow.

197
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,917
You can't be a
blank flank forever.

198
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,152
              Ahhh!

199
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,560
 All righty, Cutie Mark Campers,
    that's it for jam making.

200
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,564
  But this is fun and I didn't
     get my cutie mark yet.

201
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,733
      What if I'm not good
        at anything else?

202
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,134
   You don't get a cutie mark

203
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,802
       just because you're
       good at something,

204
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,337
         or even because
          you like it.

205
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,905
         There's more to
          it than that.

206
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,609
        I'm real good at
        painting circles,

207
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,478
       but I got my cutie
         mark in haikus.

208
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,582
Which is what I like, but uh I'm
still a blank flank like you.

209
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,119
      So, you can't get a cutie
     mark in something you like?

210
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,820
Now, we didn't say that.

211
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,088
      Rumble: You don't have to.

212
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,093
     Rumble, you came back!

213
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,828
         Say buh-bye to
        painting circles.

214
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,499
       You'll be too busy
      haikuing from now on!

215
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,068
But... I like circles.

216
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,738
     Come on, Rumble, that's
    not how cutie marks work.

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,007
So that's how cutie marks work?

218
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,343
   Am I speaking Olde Ponish?

219

  apple-pickin' minute, Rumble.

276
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,396
Where do you think you're
leading our campers?

277
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,932
        They're not your
        campers anymore.

278
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,633
    I'm starting a new camp.

279
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,970
        Everypony on this
        side of the line

280
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,372
        is in Camp Blank
         Flanks Forever!

281
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,577
But you can't be a
blank flank forever!

282
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,881
     That's just the kind of
     talk I'd expect to hear

283
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,549
     from "Camp Cutie Mark."

284
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,485
    Which is why blank flanks
 need a camp where we can enjoy

285
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,989
     being blank flanks and
 appreciate our blank-flankiness

286
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,359
    without feeling pressured
      to get a cutie mark.

287
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,763
    Now, hold on, everypony.

288
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,431
      Blank flanks forever!

289
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,067
           Blank flanks forever!
           Blank flanks forever!

290
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:34,702
           Blank flanks forever!
           Blank flanks forever! [cheering]

291
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,609
       What just happened?

292
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,145
     Has everypony gone mad?

293
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,613
        In a word, "yes."

294
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,989
        I just can't see
       what we did wrong.

295
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,957
       I thought everypony
         was having fun.

296
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,395
   They were until that Rumble
 came and made a mess of things.

297
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,263
    What are they doing now?

298
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,032
          It looks like
       whatever they want.

299
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,506
       Honestly, it's not
       all that different

300
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,941
         from what they
        were doing here.

301
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,910
    Then, what was the point?

302
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:16,815
  The point is that Rumble is a
  mad pony who must be stopped!

303
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,284
     Sweetie Belle: Now calm
        down, Crusaders.

304
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,186
         We just need to
       talk to him again.

305
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,454
          The key is to
          remain calm.

306
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,792
      [shrill] Cutie Marks
        make you SPECIAL!

307
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,261
       By putting you in a
       special little box!

308
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,629
Special!

309
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:32,831
                    Box!

310
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,599
     Come on, Sweetie Belle.

311
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,302
     I think you've remained
        calm long enough.

312
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,041
            Kettle Corn, you
        covered your cutie mark?

313
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,976
          I'm blank flank again.

314
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,211
                Keeping
                my options open.

315
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,647
      I'm more than haikus.

316
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,383
        You just
       haikued right then!

317
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,418
Don't let them
get in your head.

318
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,286
You're an open-ended
question.

319
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,221
Blank Flanks forever!

320
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,657
                    Blank Flanks
                      Forever!

321
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,495
      Blank Flanks Forever!
      Blank Flanks Forever!

322
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,835
Wow, you're
cracking great!

323
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,170
            Thanks!

324
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,638
             [gasp] Oh, no!

325
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,840
         What if I get a
        cutie mark in it?

326
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,409
            Then you'll be stuck
              doing it forever!

327
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,879
 Blank Flanks, no more potential
     cutie mark activities!

328
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,024
        Well, Cutie Mark
       Day Camp is a bust.

329
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,360
        No it isn't. It's
          a swell idea.

330
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,695
   We just can't seem to talk
     any sense into that...

331
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,263
   that Rumble.

332
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:48,206
    Maybe we can't, but I bet
    I know somepony who can.

333
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:54,979
    Let me get this straight.

334
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,882
           My little brother
       upended your entire camp?

335
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,018
                How in Equestria
                 did he do that?

336
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,386
    Well, it started when he
   couldn't toss a horseshoe,

337
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,922
       or paddle a kayak,
       or shoot an arrow,

338
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,292
 or use a pencil and we felt bad
that he wasn't good at anything,

339
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,295
 but now he doesn't want a cutie
 mark at all because he's afraid

340
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:11,563
 he'll get stuck doing something
he doesn't like forever. Y'know?

341
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,032
                    No. I don't.

342
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,900
                Rumble's good at
                 all that stuff.

343
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,836
     Well, that doesn't make
       a lick of sense...

344
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:22,273
     unless he was being bad
      at stuff on purpose!

345
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,609
    Oh. I was afraid of this.

346
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,944
Afraid of what?

347
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,746
             Ever since I became
                a Wonderbolt,

348
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,549
     Rumble's either watching me
      or trying to fly like me.

349
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,318
   He won't do anything else.

350
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,653
    That's why I thought your
   camp was such a good idea.

351
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,055
Scootaloo: I don't understand.

352
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,223
If Rumble wants to be
a Wonderbolt someday,

353
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,758
what's wrong with that?

354
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,427
     Not a thing, but right
    now he isn't even giving

355
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,163
     anything else a chance.

356
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,498
Sounds to me like
Rumble isn't afraid

357
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,767
of being "put in
a box" at all.

358
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,569
                  It doesn't?

359
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:54,039
Nope. I think Rumble's
already picked out a box.

360
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,275
He's afraid he'll get a cutie
mark that'll keep him from it.

361
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,950
       I don't know how to
         say this Rumble

362
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,620
    but, Blank Flank Forever
        Camp is kinda...

363
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,822
  Boring?

364
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,359
If we want to stay blank flanks,
   we can't risk doing stuff.

365
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,895
      What if I get a cutie
      mark in being bored?

366
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,131
   Scootaloo: Attention blank
 flanks of Cutie Mark Day Camp!

367
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,112
    The Cutie Mark Crusaders
     are pleased to announce

368
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,215
     today's special guest--
          Thunderlane!

369
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,552
    Hey, everypony! It's me!

370
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,892
              Ahh!

371
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,266
Anypony who's interested,
gather round for a day

372
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,903
of camp activities with
a genuine Wonderbolt!

373
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,775
      Er.. s-s-sorry, Rumble, but
       cutie mark or not,

374
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,577
         I'm not missing
          out on this!

375
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,450
              Whoa!

376
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,718
Apple Bloom: All right campers, it's time for
  our last activity of the day.

377
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,455
  A Wonderbolt obstacle course!

378
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,758
  Just like the one they'll fly
 through in their upcoming show!

379
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,627
    But on the ground, since
    not everypony has wings.

380
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,682
Thunderlane? Aren't you
going to run the course?

381
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,950
  Nope! I know I'm a Wonderbolt

382
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,219
      and my cutie mark is
     all about moving fast,

383
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,288
   but I really like to cook!

384
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,390
Since when?

385
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,259
    We take turns making the
     meals at Wonderbolt HQ.

386
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,495
       I didn't want to at
    first, but now I love it.

387
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,297
 I just wish I tried it sooner.

388
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,466
             You do?

389
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:36,667
           Of course!

390
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,402
       There's more to me
        than just flying.

391
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,938
        And I bet there's
        more to you too.

392
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,782
        Obstacles are fun

393
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,585
          Running free
      through mud and dirt

394
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,754
     Beats circle painting!

395
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,923
That haiku pretty
well sums it up.

396
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,463
   Looks like Thunderlane was
 right about the obstacle course

397
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,098
        getting Rumble to
         come back over.

398
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,232
          Hey, Rumble.

399
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,134
       Aren't you gonna do
     our Wonderbolt course?

400
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,369
              I'm cooking today.

401
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:12,903
               Maybe I'll do the
               course tomorrow.

402
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,339
So, you're coming back tomorrow?

403
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,009
    You're not worried about
    getting your cutie mark?

404
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,745
       Nah. I already know
        I'm a good flyer.

405
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,313
  It kinda runs in the family.

406
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,382
    I guess it's time to see
   what other stuff I can do.

407
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,451
             Hm hm.
