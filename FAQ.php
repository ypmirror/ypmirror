<!--#include file="header.php" --><p><strong>Why are there subtitles on my video? I don't want subtitles!</strong>
<p> The subtitles aren't burnt-in, and they can be turned on and off in your player. Subtitles has been added for people who don't understand spoken English. <br />
</p>
<p><strong> What software or player should I use?</strong> </p>
<p> We recommand <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"> VLC Media Player</a> or <a href="https://mpc-hc.org/">MPC:HC</a> for all versions of Windows. On Linux you can use mplayer, smplayer, MPV or VLC (check your package manager). On Mac OS X, you can use<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mplayerx/id421131143?mt=12&amp;affId=403761"> MplayerX </a> (AppStore link) or <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"> VLC Media Player</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>You will need a recent version (MPC:HC 1.7.1 or better, VLC 2.2.0 or better) to decode HEVC!<br />

<p><strong> I have read somewhere that Tor is for hidden websites that are involved in terrorism, child abuse and kitten murder. Why is Yay Ponies mirrored there?</strong> </p>
<p> Tor is a neutral network, everyone is anonymous, to protect freedom of expression, regardless of the nature of the content. We know that these kinds of site exist on the Tor network, and even though we are strongly against the terrible act of murdering kitten, the answer is that we simply don't visit them. We invite you to do the same, and visit only good sites, like those that provide you with ponies. :p (We like <a href="http://www.for-the-love-of-cats.com/images/kittenbyyukari.jpg">kitten</a>. And ponies! :) . <br />
</p>
<p><strong> D'awwwww !</strong> </p>
<p> Yeah ... we know ... <br />
</p>
<p><strong> Can I help you with the hard task of sharing ponies?</strong> </p>
<p> Firstly, always seed anything after you download it! Next, you can help out by offering mirrors of the site!<br />
</p>
<p><strong>What's           up with the filename format?<br />
  </strong>On YayPonies we have a  wide variety of formats for you to chose from. When you download a  video, you will notice that the filename contains the information as to  which format you downloaded (right before the seasonXepisode  identifier). Here are the ones available:<br />

  <strong><br />
    What does this lossy/lossless compression mean?!</strong><br />
  The lossless compression, as the name implies, means that after compressing the video, and then decompressing it, you wind up with the exact same data as you put in. A lossy compression is when you compress the video and, after decompressing it, you do not get back what you put in. Note that we're exact at 100% when we mean lossy/lossless, and color correction itself mean loss !<br />
</p>
<p><strong>What the difference between iTunes US and Australian iTunes file ?</strong></p>
<p>Encoding has been done differently on the Australian iTunes than on the US one, there no cropping, colors isnt terribly fade, there a lot less glitch (we only spotted 1 mid broken frame on 01x12) on australian iTunes files too... <br />
