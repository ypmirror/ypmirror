    <strong>Linux</strong><br />
    It's easy as pie! For all of these UNIX-like operating systems you just have to get the &quot;Tor Browser Bundle for 64-Bit
    Linux&quot; if you're running a 64 bit system, otherwise download the &quot;Tor Browser Bundle for Linux&quot; in case
    you're using a 32 bit distribution or when you're not sure whether or not you have a 64 bit system on your box.
    Then simply extract the archive with a program of your choice and run  the &quot;start-tor-browser&quot; shell
    script which is located within the  extracted folder. That's all! Just go to our .onion website with the new browser window.
    If it doesn't work out of the box make sure the script is executable by  running the command
    &quot;chmod a+x /home/username/path_to_the_script&quot;.
