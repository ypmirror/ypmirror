111
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,925
  Uh-huh. All right.            

112
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:43,328
        I'll tell him.          
 You, too, you flab-drasser.    

113
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,764
     Mm-hmm. Bye.               

114
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,799
      She says you have         
         a dumb face,           

115
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,734
   and she doesn't like you     
   and she never liked you,     

116
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,736
 and she's never coming back    
because your face is so dumb.   

117
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,939
         ( laughter )           
      What's the matter?        

118
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,008
   The power of friendship      
       didn't save you?         

119
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,849
      Oh, man, that was...      

120
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,585
    That was really mean,       
          wasn't it?            

121
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,186
              Have I always     
              been that mean?   

122
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,924
      I'm finally seeing        
    the error of my ways.       

123
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,093
          - Really?             
           - Yeah.              

124
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,128
                You really need 
                       my help, 

125
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,599
           and here I am, being 
           an insensitive jerk. 

126
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,701
      I'd probably feel         
         a lot better           

127
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,870
       if someone just          
     hugged me right now.       

128
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,272
            Gosh, if I even got 
              the littlest hug, 

129
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:31,376
         I would totally reform 
       and not be evil anymore. 

130
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,613
       ( gasps ) Hater,         
I'm right here for you, buddy.  

131
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,682
                Too bad there's 
                 no one here to 
           make me feel better. 

132
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,217
Yo! Right here.                 

133
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,821
A one-armed hug                 
still comes with                
a wide open heart.              

134
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,524
               What, no takers? 
     Guess I'll just stay evil. 

135
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,793
            Ha! You're finished!

136
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,630
           Useless.             
      Bye-bye, good guy.        

137
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,633
        You can't even          
       wander anymore.          

138
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,135
You're more like                
Stander.                        

139
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,837

      ( raucous laughter )      

141
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,706
     You know what you are?     

142
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,010
         You're just            
    a whole lotta nothing.      

143
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,312
    "Never hurts to help."      
             Ha!                

144
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,349
       If I can't even          
     give a friend a hug,       

145
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,052
     then what good am I        
           at all?              

146
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,222
( mocking ) Never hurts         
to help, never hurts to help.   

147
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,926
    - Never hurts to help.      
      - Wait, what now?         

148
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,194
    Here I was, selfishly       
        thinking about          

149
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,897
     how I was suffering,       
   totally forgetting about     

150
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,500
  all the folks I'm helping     
        by not letting          

151
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,936
  the galaxy get sucked into    
       this black hole.         

152
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,371
     And shucks, I'm even       
         helping you.           

153
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,073
        Wait, what? No!         

154
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,075
 Never hurts to help.           

155
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,710
Thanks for reminding            
me, pal.                        

156
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,545
That was just                   
the help I needed.              

157
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,914
                     ( shrieks )

158
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,584
            Don't you dare find 
             a positive in this 
      terrible, horrible thing. 

159
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,822
       Who's helping now?       

160
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,167
            Oh, no.             

161
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,203
                Wow, Lord Hater,

162
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,471
                  you're saving 
               the galaxy, too. 

163
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,107
               I knew there was 
                   good in you. 

164
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,776
No. Oh, no. No!                 

165
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,278
        But don't worry.        

166
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,547
     You kept me company        
     in my darkest hour,        

167
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,949
       and I'll happily         
     do the same for you.       

168
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:22,287
     ( voice distorting )

      and ever and ever.        

170
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,629
     So he was literally        
        doing nothing,          

171
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,664
       and you could've         
      just ignored him,         

172
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,332
           and he would've been 
           stuck there forever, 

173
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,134
