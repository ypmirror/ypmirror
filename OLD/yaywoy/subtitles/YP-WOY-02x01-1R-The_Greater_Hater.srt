17
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,893
         the greatest           
        in the galaxy!

        [evil laughter]         

19
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,601
                Hey, Hater, got 
              your team's flag. 

20
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,270
                    Come tag me.

21
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,605
           [roars]              
       Come back here.          

22
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,941
Please, sir, no.                
Just ignore him.                

23
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,777
You know Wander's the reason    
you're no longer the greatest   
in the galaxy.                  

24
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,349
       I'm sorry, sir,          
        but it's true.          

25
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,186
   You wasted so much time      
chasing him around the universe 

26
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,887
       that you've lost         
     any standing you had       

27
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,756
       as a real villain.       

28
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,825
And now there's bad guys        
everywhere taking over          

29
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,927
all the territory               
you lost.                       

30
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,262
You're more like                
29th-greatest in                
the galaxy,                     

31
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,598
which is why we need            
to get back in the game         

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,234
and conquer as many             
planets as possible.            

33
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,369
             Hater!             

34
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,338
   Peepers, that's totally      
    what I'm trying to do       

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,373
       but like Wander          
    totally took our flag.      

36
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,842
Sir, the flag is                
really just symbolic.           

37
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,311
                    No. Get him!

38
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,683
          ( snoring )           

39
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,321
WANDER: Yeeee-haaa!             

40
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,893
        That's my cue.          
           Ladies.              

41
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,673
           Nothing...           

42
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,309
        ever... changes.        

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,439
 Who is this guy?               

44
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,176
        Definitely new          
     to the neighborhood.       

45
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,911
      I think we should         
          go say hi.            

46
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,883
        Wander, buddy,          
   these are bad neighbors,     

47
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,818
         and I think            
      it's time to move.        

48
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,023
        Uh, sorry, Syl,         

49
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,125
   but what do I always say?    

50
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,295
       An enemy is just         
a friend you haven't made yet.  

51
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,898
  Sometimes you have to look    
 beyond the demonic exterior    

52
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,800
   of someone's horrifying      
       battle cruiser,          

53
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,168
    find the person inside,     

54
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,136
        and offer them          
       your friendship.         

55
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:01,039
   No matter how terrified      
         you may be!            

56
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,076
       Besides, I have          
       a secret weapon.         

57
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:08,080
         <i> Fruit basket!</i>         

58
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,281
               Going up.        

59
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,850
                   First floor, 
               scary lava ship. 

60
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,986
          Top floor,            
         friendship.            

61
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,221
                     Whoo!      

62
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:19,124
   I got your back, buddy,      
 with two weapons of my own.    

63
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,959
       - Right, ladies?         
        - [shivering]           

64
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,269
             What just happened?

65
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:34,273
Gee, sir, maybe exactly         
what I said was happening!      

66
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,208
While you were busy             
chasing Wander around,          

67
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,809
 you got planet-jacked.         

68
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,444
        What is this,           
        amateur hour?           

69
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,113
He can't just swoop in          
and steal a planet              

70
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,081
after I already                 
planted a flag.                 

71
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,983
     The flag is a symbol!      

72
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,853
 Sir, this guy's impressive.    
    Maybe too impressive.       

73
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,388
   I suggest we go and deal     
        with this foe           

74
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,957
  when we're better prepared.   

75
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,227
   Please. An enemy's just      
an enemy I haven't defeated yet.

76
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,862
     I'll show this chump       
         what happens           

77
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,197
      when you mess with        
 the greatest in the galaxy.    

78
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,999
        Be back in five.        

79
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,176
         WANDER: Hello.         

80
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,279
         Anybody here?          

81
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,022
          Welcome to            
         our galaxy.            

82
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,928
         Nobody home.           
          Let's go.             

83
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,963
          No way. Ship this big,

00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,301
    If you don't like fruit,    

86
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,937
  there's also a collection     
      of small cheeses.         

87
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,981
           Finally.             
      The welcome party.        

88
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,984
     SYLVIA: Not the vibe       
      I'm getting here.         

89
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,498
       Hello. Hey there.

95
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,956

mega lasers?                    

110
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,341
          ( scoffs )            
          Whatever.             

111
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,143
        Nova combusters?        

112
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,978
     I didn't even think        
        those existed.          

113
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,015
Big deal. I could have that;    
I just don't want to.           

114
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:33,018
         And that. I don't know 
            what that is, but-- 

115
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
                   ( shrieking )

116
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,022
               It's super cool, 
             that's what it is. 

117
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,658
     I can't wait to put        
    this guy in his place.      

118
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,960
       First he steals          
      my stolen planet,         

119
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,396
    then he has the nerve       
  to have stuff that I want.    

120
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,431
              Why don't we have 
       awesome stuff like this? 

121
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,434
            This is your fault, 
                      isn't it? 

122
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,136
We could've had                 
all this,                       

123
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,738
but someone needed              
a hot tub,                      

124
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,073
 and an arcade,                 

125
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,075
and an entire research          
team to develop                 

126
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,244
new barbecue sauces             
for the food court.             

127
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,246
A food court,                   
by the way,                     

128
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,815
we built instead of             
an atom smasher,                

129
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,084
which this guy                  
also has!                       

130
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,120
       Well, I can have         
      all that and more!        

131
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,590
      For I am Lord Hater,      

132
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,425
     the greatest in the...     

133
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:16,394
 Twenty-ninth greatest.         

134
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,706
       Not so cool now, are you?

135
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,541
           Ha ha ha.            

136
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,568
          Ah, so cool.          

137
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,552
        Hey, that was           
    thoughtfully arranged.      

138
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,387
     Do you have any idea       
        how hard it is          

139
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,789
      to balance bananas?       

140
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,629
        Wander, I know          
  you don't wanna hear this,    

141
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:28,233
        but these guys          
         are trouble.           

142
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,801
          Maybe you're right.   

143
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,102
No, they're not friendly.       

144
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,470
       They're... what?         
         Wait, what?            

145
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,372
     I don't want to jump       
       to conclusions,          

146
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:38,543
   but I'm starting to feel     
   not very welcomed here.      

147
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,525
   SYLVIA: Tell me about it.    

148
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,398
       Maybe this enemy         
      is just an enemy.         

149
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,167
I'm sorry, buddy.               

150
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,202
I know you always want          
to see the best in people,      

151
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,805
but sometimes,                  
there's nothing there to see.   

152
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,708
Either way,                     
these walls ain't budging.      

153
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,409
We're not going                 
anywhere.                       

154
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:15,146
             You'd almost think 
        they wanted us to stay. 

155
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,453
      Maybe this is how         
    they show hospitality       

156
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,254
      where they're from.       

157
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,190
      Maybe this is all         
      some kooky mix-up         

158
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,292
that we'll all laugh about later
    over ripe cantaloupe.       

159
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,295
Maybe one of us has a hard time 
   dealing with rejection.      

160
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,231
        Welcome party           
        back on track!          

161
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,166
         <i> Fruit basket!</i>         

162
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,802
          Yeeee-haaaa!          

163
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,338
         ( shrieking )          

164
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,347
          The basket!           

165
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,363
            - You!              
            - You!              

166
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,699
            - Me.               
           - Them!              

167
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,235
             Are you here to be 
         our new neighbor, too? 

168
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,369
                    I don't see 
                        a gift. 

169
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,338
Haven't forgotten               
about my flag.                  

170
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,372
 No time.                       

171
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,346
Must go faster.                 

172
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,448
          Much faster.          

173
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,584
   Oh, cuffs are seriously      
       slowing me down.         

174
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,192
        Who is this guy?        

175
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,617
              No.               

176
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,922
              No.               

177
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,626
No.                             

178
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,929
     I'm really sorry, Syl,     

179
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,231
     but I just gotta try.      

180
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,899
      I know this seems         
           bananas,             

181
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,302
      and I must be plum        
       out of my melon,         

182
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,837
       but I don't pear.        

183
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,405
       The way I fig-ure,       

184
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,241
     the rottenest apple        
    still has a sweet spot      

185
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,243
          at its core.          

186
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,612
           Kumquat!!            

187
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,248
      Wander, he's gonna        
         destroy you.           

188
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,318
      Sorry, I gotta try.       

189
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,355
                   Hello to you.

190
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,556
           Folks call me Wander,

191
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,458
             and this is Sylvia.

192
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,563
          Welcome to the galaxy.

193
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,832
        We hope you will accept 
                our humble gift 

194
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,268
               of friendship.   

195
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,773
        Perhaps I was           
      a bit too formal.         

196
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,376
                ( clear throat, 
                        sighs ) 

197
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,278
       Hello. Hi. Howdy.        

198
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,080
      Hi. How's it goin'?       

199
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,282
      Hey. Hey, hey, hey.       

200
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,753
          Hey. Hello!           

201
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,322
      Nope. Less formal,        
         less formal.           

202
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,590
                      What's up?

00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,692

        It's me. Hello.

00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,832
      Bee-boop, we come         
          in peace.

      I love the place.

00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,916
    Sylvia, I don't think       
          our friend            

212
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,350

214
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:44,322
      I think this calls

          BOTH: Whew!           

222
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,529
      Sir, I really must        
        insist we go,           

223
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,832
    and deal with this foe      
 when we're better prepared.    

224
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,068
      Maybe you're right.       

225
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,837
      What?! Wait, what?        
      I mean, good. Yes.        

226
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,773
            Now we just have to 
              break out of here 
         quietly and carefully. 

227
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,745
     Oh, I'll settle for        
     loudly and quickly.        

228
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,416
                  Come on, sir. 
           Let's get outta here 

229
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,553
            so you can focus on 
          being the greatest in 
              the galaxy again. 

230
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,422
     Twenty-ninth greatest.     

231
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,091
             What?              

232
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,059
 If I'm gonna be the greatest   
     in the galaxy again,       

233
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,695
     I'm gonna start with       
    whoever this loser is.      

234
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:01,132
        Hey, robo-dork.         

235
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,834
          Let's rumba.          

236
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,070
    Sir, what are you doing?    

237
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,439
         I can't run.           
   I want to be number one.     

238
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,446
            Wander?             

239
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,515
            Wander!             

240
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,751
                        Wander!!

241
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,519
          ( choking )           

242
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,922
         Oh, Wander, thank Grab.

243
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,157
                     Let him go.

244
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,493
              You molten menace.

245
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:34,132
      He was only trying        
      to be your friend.        

246
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,936
     Folks call me Sylvia.      

247
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,173
      And I'm not so nice.      

248
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,144
            Ladies.             

249
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,682
     Welcome to the galaxy!     

250
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,985
                       No!      

251
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,527
            Finally.            

252
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,262
     My brilliant getting       
        captured plan           

253
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,998
     has led us right to        
     this two-bit terror.       

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,933
         Time to take           
      this sucker down.         

255
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:14,138
    Invaders apprehended,       
       Lord Dominator.          

256
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,673
        Lord Dominator?         

257
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,543
     That totally rhymes        
        with "Hater."           

258
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,484
What?! He totally               
looks like...                   

259
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,619
          Hey, friend.          

260
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,658
       Aaargh, he's...          
    ( enraged sputtering )      

261
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,627
      destroy my enemy...       

262
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,664
         Hate... jerk!          

263
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,001
     What I wanted to do.       
          Aaaarggh!             

264
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,104
    So cool, must destroy!!     

265
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,885
       Wander's my enemy.       

266
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,854
     Enemy? Come on, Hater.     

267
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,557
  You know an enemy is just     
a friend you haven't made yet.  

268
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,893
       What? Ew! Shut up!       

269
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,763
                Wander! Are you 
                   okay, buddy? 

270
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,765
 Impressive, sir.               

271
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,199
Sorry for                       
doubting you.                   

272
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,901
After defeating                 
this guy,                       

273
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,637
you must certainly are          
the greatest in the galaxy.     

274
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,540
     Accept no imitations!      

275
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,032
        Okay, time out.         

276
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,568
       Fine. You can be         
 the greatest in the galaxy.    

277
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,603
         Mercy, please.         

278
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,672
     Hey, watch the lava        
       round the guava.         

279
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,285
           Oh, yes,             
    you'll most definitely      

280
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,986
      conquer the entire        
      galaxy with those.        

281
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:12,223
      But you can't run         
 if you wanna be number one.    

282
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,198
       <i> Commander Peepers!</i>      

283
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,637
          Ha ha! Yes!           

284
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,845
     Let this be a reminder     

285
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,647
    that if you march into      
         <i> my </i> galaxy,           

286
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,350
  you're gonna have to deal     
           with me!             

287
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,158
            Wander!             

288
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,994
       I have had enough.       

289
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,630
     I will have you know       
      I gave you a gift.        

290
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,632
I complimented                  
your ship.                      

291
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,001
I even played                   
you a song.                     

292
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,740
All in the name                 
of friendship.                  

293
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,242
And you can't even              
be neighborly                   

294
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,743
and make some small talk        
like,                           

295
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,178
"Thanks for the fruit           
basket, Wander.                 

296
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,980
Isn't that                      
an interesting name?            

297
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,681
And I'd be, like,               
"Well, I guess."                

298
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,383
Funny story. That's             
not really my...                

299
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,684
But that's not important.       

300
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:17,388
What is important               
is I told you that              

301
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,857
an enemy is just a friend       
you haven't made yet.           

302
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,761
But after your rude             
and inconsiderate               
behavior today,                 

303
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:29,100
I'm not sure I want             
to be your friend.              

304
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,139
And I must admit...             

305
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,175
              I'm coming, buddy.

306
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,743
      ...though it hurts        
          to say it,            

307
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,846
     I have to tell you...      

308
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:47,251
      that I don't think        
     that you deserve...        

309
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:54,759
        a fruit basket.         

310
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,934
         This is for            
       my real friends.         

311
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,835
            Tangelo?            

312
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,239
       ( all screaming )        

313
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,708
             Whew!              

314
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,811
         ( screaming )          

315
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,746
             Whew!              

316
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,482
         ( screaming )          

317
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,092
Please,                         
he's a dope.                    

318
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,860
         No, really,            
      he's not an idiot.        

319
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,729
       He totally knows         
       what he's doing.         

320
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,331
         ( explosion )          

321
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,978
           - Who...             
        - Was that...           

322
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,813
            ...guy?!            

323
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,963
    ( deep demonic voice )      
        That... was...          

324
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,799
       ( girlish voice)         
         ...amazing!            

325
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,069
     They were all, like,       
    what, who is this guy?      

326
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,405
      Then I was, like,         
           serious,             

327
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,240
      then I was all...         
          ( roars),             

328
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,942
    and then the lava was...    

329
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,378
      and they were all,        
         Ah, no way!            

330
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,912
           ( laughs )           

331
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,948
     What a bunch of dorks.     

332
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,384
     This is going to be...     

333
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,452
      ( demonic voice )         
           ...fun.              

334
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:32,123
       ( evil laughter )        

335
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,334
So you think this guy           
is, what,                       

336
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,935
 Hater's brother?               

337
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,270
Oh, maybe he's                  
Lord Hater's dad                

338
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,105
come to show him                
who's boss.                     

339
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,940
                 Wait, Lord who?

340
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,242
        Uh, Lord Hater,         

341
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:53,077
      that skeleton guy         
         we work for.           

342
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,112
          I've been calling him 
                 the wrong name 

343
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,914
                 for six months.

344
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,382
              Why didn't anyone 
                       tell me? 

345
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,084
What did you think              
he was called?                  

346
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,019
          I've been calling him 
                    Lord Vad... 

347
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,055
                 ( explosion )
