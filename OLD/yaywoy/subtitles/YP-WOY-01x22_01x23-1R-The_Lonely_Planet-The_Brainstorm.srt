231
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:04,262
      I was wrong to try        
   and force you to love me.    

232
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,797
       All I ever wanted        
       was a friendship         

233
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,565
   like you and Sylvia have.    

234
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,502

     in the stars for me.
