46
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,814
        Probably not.           
  We are all clearly doomed.    

47
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,183
      WANDER: Well, now,        
     I wouldn't say that.       

48
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,421
    ( prisoners exclaiming )    

49
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:05,057
       If brave Wander          
and noble Sylvia are captured,  

50
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,826
         then surely            
         all is lost!           

51
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,997
Captured? Please.               

52
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,700
We just needed a place          
to crash for the night,         
so we popped in.                

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,808

       No! We shall not         
          go quietly            

65
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,644

      - ( all agreeing )

00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,204
         Oh, my Grop.           
          It's him.             

229
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,243
       It's Major Threat!       

230
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,782
PEEPERS: His telekinetic powers 
      can crush planets.        

231
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,886
   That dude is the evilest     
          evil-doer             

232
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,855
   - that ever do-ed evil.      
     - Sir, we're doomed!       

233
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,990
          After all these years 
                 of conquering, 

234
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,859
        it comes down           
           to this.             

235
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,360
  When I finally meet my...     

236
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,429
            idol!               

237
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,431
Huge, huge fan.                 

238
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,600
I know, like,                   
all your evil deeds.            

239
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,336
You're pretty much              
the reason I got into           
villainy in the first place.    

240
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,105
Threat's best.                  
Great villain!                  

241
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,247
                  Call me Jeff. 

242
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,952
     Okay, Jeff.                

243
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,954
You are like,                   
the worst, the best.            

244
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,355
Best at being                   
the worst.                      

245
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,257
        Uh, thanks, bud.        

246
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,426
              Bud!              

247
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,462
                 But I'm really 
          embarrassed about all 
         that conquering stuff. 

248
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,765
                    It was just 
              take, take, take, 

249
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,467
       without giving a thought 
                  to, you know, 

250
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,269
                the people, man,

251
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,605
         and how they           
        were feeling.           

252
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,873
      ( confused yelp )         

253
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,474
                 ( laughs )     

254
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,409
       Sorry, man, this must be 
              a bit of a shock. 

255
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,044
                       I'm sure 
          you were expecting... 

256
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:03,915
          Roar! I shall destroy 
                    your soul!! 

257
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,818
                 And here I am, 
       all peace and love, man. 

258
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,887
                     ( laughs ) 
               You must be all, 

259
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,290
         What? Did Major Threat 
                  go all cuckoo 
            in the head, right? 

260
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,394
   Uh, yeah. Kinda thought      
      cuckoo head, yeah.        

261
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,496
                   Well, I did. 
                 I went cuckoo. 

262
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,298
          Cuckoo for conquering,

263
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,067
          until I crossed paths 
    with this wandering weirdo. 

264
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,335
   Oh, no.                      

265
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,070
           Strange visitor from 
                who knows where 

266
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,473
          who came to my galaxy 
      with powers of positivity 

267
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,142
            far beyond those of 
                        anyone. 

268
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,844
           Oh, no.              

269
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,113
     Yeah, he went around       
      helping everyone.         

270
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,515
       Totally drove me         
       even cuckoo-ier.         

271
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,517
           Oh, no!              

272
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,252
                   I chased him 
             around the galaxy, 

273
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,154
          vowing to destroy him.

274
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,323
         Yes! I mean,           
           oh, no.              

275
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,526
          Yeah, and in the end, 
    do you know what he wanted? 

276
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,528
      No, what? What did        
         Wander want?           

277
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,497
I mean, what did                
he want?                        

278
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,367
                  Just to be... 
                     my friend. 

279
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,703
      ( anguished shriek )      

280
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,471
     Yeah, it's crazy, man.     

281
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,440
   It was like he wanted me     
    to hate him at first.       

282
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,209
      When he eventually        
        wore me down,           

283
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,044
     and we became friends,     

284
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:09,113
             I realized that if 
              I learned to like 
                 this one thing 

285
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,615
                I used to hate, 

286
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,350
                  then what was 
            the point of hating 

287
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,985
            all the other stuff 
                       I hated? 

288
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,954
    With less hate in my heart, 

289
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,722
               I might start to 
         be happy and not be... 

290
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,191
Such a bad guy anymore?         

291
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,392
               Exactly, man!    

292
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,461
        So like I was           
       saying earlier,          

293
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,898
    your reign of terror's      
   gonna have to end, man.      

294
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,367
       This aggression          
         won't stand.           

295
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,239
              No!!              

296
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,374
     I warned you, Peepers.     

297
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,710
      Sir, just because         
    Major Threat fell prey      

298
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,478
  to that wandering weirdo,     
         it doesn't--           

299
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,413
       It's hopeless!!          

300
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,985
         Don't you see?         

301
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:50,555
  Threat was the villainiest    
     villain of all time,       

302
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,926
  and Wander loved the hate     
      right out of him.         

303
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:58,396
     He Wander-ized him.        

304
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,599
     And now he wants to        
        Wander-ize me.          

305
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,202
      Here, man, let me         
      help you fix this.        

306
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,504
          That's it.            
        I can fix you.          

307
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,073
Sir, I don't think              
that's such a good idea.        

308
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,043
   No, if I can remind him      
how good he is at being evil,   

309
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,446
 it'll prove once and for all   
  that bad is in the bones.     

310
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,049
You are not good.               

311
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,585
You are just bad                
at remembering                  

312
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,521
how good                        
it was being bad.               

313
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,592
 Like the time you conquered    
 the unconquerable Klangors.    

314
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,061
Grop yeah, the Klangors, man.   

315
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,230
       I gave up being          
     their evil dictator,       

316
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:35,233
and turned them on              
to democratic elections.        

317
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,567
         Okay, okay,            
         bad example.           

318
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,469
                    You blew up 
           the sun of Solarion. 

319
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,105
     Now it's Skilorian,        

320
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,641
       a winter getaway         
and non-profit research facility

321
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,978
        to study climate change.

322
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,949
    ( frustrated scream )       

323
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:54,085
         You're bad!            
   Ninety-ounce Nihilists?      

324
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,654
    You were the loudest,       
most evil band in the universe. 

325
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:57,956
       Oh, no, no, no.          

326
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,291
                  I could never 
               quit music, man. 

327
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,494
    Me and the guys still       
      hang out and jam.         

328
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,663
                   You see?     

329
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,131
        You can be even greater 

330
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,535
              by saying "later" 
                  to the Hater. 

331
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,172
 Stop hugging everything!       

332
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,507
        Okay, time for          
        the big guns.           

333
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,609
          Victimon.             

334
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,512
They are primed                 
and ready for destruction.      

335
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,315
I would like you                
to do the honors.               

336
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,250
          You're sure?          

337
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,685
         Oh, please.            

338
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,520
     If this doesn't get        
   the evil juices flowing,     

339
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,656
        nothing will.           
          I insist.             

340
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,592
    Well, uh, if you insist.    

341
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,232
          Yes. Yes!             

342
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,542
          No!!                  

343
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,711
    Whoa, take her easy, man.   

344
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,481
            Just take her easy. 

345
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,682
Oh, yeah?                       

346
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,517
What are you                    
gonna do about it, Jeff?        

347
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,319
 Huh, man?                      

348
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,021
You gonna play                  
your stupid flute               

349
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,256
        for some poor           
        puppy orphans?          

350
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,069
      I'll have your hug        
  waitin' when you're ready.    

351
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,208
                Fine. You can't 
              keep us prisoner. 

352
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,577
         We're leaving.         
         Come on, Peepers.      

353
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,546
         Sir, he never actually 
              took us prisoner. 

354
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,148
      Also, technically,        
      this is our ship.         

355
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,383
                       Shut up! 
                   I know that. 

356
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,953
       Hey, hug it out,         
      don't slug it out.        

357
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,192
        Oh, I'm terribly sorry. 

358
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,095
                      Does that 
              bother you, Jeff? 

359
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,904
                Seriously, sir, 
              you really... ow! 
                     My retina. 

360
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:01,012
 Hey, how do you like it if I   
treated you like that, you know?

361
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,385
What if I slapped               
your helmet off, man, huh?      

362
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,021
What if I pushed you            
to the ground?                  

363
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,457
     Yeah, and take over        
          your ship?            

364
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,630
Yeah, and what if I take over   
    your whole army, huh?       

365
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,466
       Then what would...       

366
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:25,803
  By Grop, I forgot how good    
       being bad feels.         

367
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:26,904
            Yeah!               

368
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,407
    Major Threat is back,       

369
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,242
    and I'm gonna conquer       
         every planet           

370
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,711
        in this whole           
       stinkin' galaxy,         

371
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,646
      starting with yours.      

372
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,348
              Yeah! What?       

373
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,755
      I can't beat him.         

374
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,491
          It's over,            
        I'm finished.           

375
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,725
        Done, conquered.        

376
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:48,893
       That dude, I mean,       

377
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,495
       Major Threat is          
    the evilest evil-doer       

378
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,730
    that ever do-ed evil.       

379
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,732
    The only reason he was      
      stopped last time         

380
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,801
        was because...          
           oh, no.              

381
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,436
          Not that.             

382
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,105
          Oh, yeah,             
         that's five.           

383
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,342
      Five more planets         
        that are mine.          

384
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,310
          All mine!             

385
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,513
          Pipsqueak,            
       how great am I?          

386
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,849
     ( shivering ) Tenth planet 
 in the last five minutes, sir, 

387
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,351
                  which means...

388
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:17,288
     I'm ten steps closer       
        to once again           

389
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,858
    becoming the greatest       
        in the galaxy!          

390
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,127
    Nothing can stop me now.    

391
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,463
          Threaty, is that you? 

392
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,764
            It's me.            

393
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:31,369
        Your old pal,           
     Sunshine Banjo Face.       

394
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,105
     Why the frowny face,       
       Sir Frownsalot?          

395
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,174
                Let's go tickle 
             some caterpillars, 

396
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:40,344
and make lemonade               
out of snowflakes!              

397
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,848
         Major Threat           
      will not abide by         

398
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,218
  such a disgusting display     
         of optimism.           

399
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:56,294
     Take that and that,        
you grop-derned flabdrassers.   

400
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:03,568
There's only one thing          
to trump the grumpies,          
and that's...

                    Sorry I had 
             to fool you there, 

414
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:53,117
           but I knew there was 
                good deep down  
                in those bones. 

415
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,952
           Oh, no.              

416
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,021
     You not only helped        
      your friends here,        

417
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,923
                   but you also 
           saved yourself, man. 

418
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,558
   Oh, no.                      

419
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,526
     You'll thank me later.     

420
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,695
     It's like Tumbleweed       
         always said,           

421
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,230
   it never hurts to help.      

422
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,398
              Who?              

423
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,100
                Um, Tumbleweed. 

424
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,736
             That goofball that 
                drove me crazy, 

425
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,804
                   then made me 
               a better person. 

426
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,439
Wait, wasn't                    
his name Wander?                

427
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,942
             Nope. Folks called 
                him Tumbleweed. 

428
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,578
            Yes!!               

429
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,913
    Whoo!                       
    Thank Grop.                 

430
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,582
Oh, I was worried               
for a second                    

431
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,817
that I was doomed               
to suffer the same              
fate as you.                    

432
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,553
              But I'm obviously 
                 so much better 
                 and more evil. 

433
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,490
  Don't let the door hit you    
       on the way out.          

434
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,592
I don't know what               
I was freaked out about.        

435
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:37,595
My annoying wanderer            
is totally different.           

436
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,798
He plays a dumb banjo           
and hands out stupid            
sandwiches and...               

437
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,401
           Ha! Mustard or mayo, 
               mustard or mayo, 

438
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,935
    mustard or mayo?            

439
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,871
           Oh, no.              

440
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,145
          ( laughter )          

441
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,946
        We could plant          
   a handful of jellybeans      

442
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,682
     and grow a rainbow,        
        or shake hands          

443
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,850
     with the ladybug at        
 the carnival in the clouds.    

444
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,153
    Or shave a candy cane       
 down to peppermint glitter.    

445
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,989
   Or give butterfly kisses     
   to an actual butterfly.      

446
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,057
            Or...
