           AND WE'LL            
         CALL IT EVEN.          

107
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:22,187
WELL, I'M REALLY                
NOT SUPPOSED TO LET             
ANYBODY IN THE BUILDING.        

108
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,022
              OH, COME ON.      

109
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,391
             PLEASE. I'LL LEAVE 
           AS SOON AS I'M DONE. 

110
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,827
                     I PROMISE. 

111
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,200
           OH, RATS.            
         OUT OF ORDER.          

112
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,102
WELL, GUESS YOU'LL              
HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.      

113
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:41,239
       NO. I PROMISED I'D LEAVE 
           AS SOON AS I'M DONE, 

114
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:46,078
                AND A LOCKSMITH 
        NEVER BREAKS A PROMISE. 

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,946
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?             

116
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,416
  DON'T WORRY, I GOT A BUDDY    
 WHO CAN TOTALLY HANDLE THIS.   

117
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,151
WAIT, NO!                       

118
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,956
  IT'S WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.    
   GONNA BE HERE ALL NIGHT.     

119
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,125
BETTER ORDER A PIZZA.           
      WAIT, NO!                 

120
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,568
          UM, SYLVIA?           

121
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,436
        WANDER, WHO ARE         
       ALL THOSE PEOPLE?        

122
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,472
I DON'T KNOW.                   

123
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,475
THEY KEEP COMING AND COMING,    
AND NEVER GOING.                
WHAT DO I DO?                   

124
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,111
  GET THEM OUT OF HERE BEFORE   
  THEY ACCIDENTALLY FIND US.    

125
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:20,979
         SMASH & SASS,          
       EVERYTHING OKAY?         

126
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,884
            I-OKAY.             
        GO, INSURGENTS.         

127
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,286
               BUT HOW?         

128
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,590
I DON'T CARE HOW.               
JUST DO IT QUICKLY.             

129
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,425
 AND DO IT QUIETLY.             

130
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,160
          PLASMA LEAK!          

131
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,329
      TOTALLY DANGEROUS,        
          POISONOUS.            

132
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,932
         SO EVERYBODY           
       BETTER LEAVE NOW.        

133
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,153
HEY, BUDDY,                     
WHAT'S WRONG?                   

134
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,554
OH, NOTHING.                    

135
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,023
    IT'S JUST THAT I REALLY     
     NEED YOU ALL TO LEAVE      

136
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,059
   SO MY BEST FRIEND'S DREAM    
OF BEING A BIG TOP ACTION HERO  

137
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,628
CAN COME TRUE.                  

138
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,197
NO BIGGIE, THOUGH.              

139
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,332
SURE THING,                     
LITTLE GUY.                     

140
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,668
OUR JOB IS TO PUT               
A STOP TO PLASMA LEAKS,         
NOT DREAMS.                     

141
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,237
COME ON, FELLAS.                

142
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,074
PIPE'S ALL FIXED.               

143
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,180
       PIPE'S ALL FIXED.        
          I PROMISE.            

144
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:32,350
   Both: BECAUSE A LOCKSMITH    
    NEVER BREAKS A PROMISE.     

145
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,289
SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.           
I GOT ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES.  

146
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,191
PROBABLY WHY THEY               
REPLACED ME.                    

147
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,159
                     GOOD LUCK, 
                     PRETTY BOY.

148
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,164
                     WOWIE!     

149
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,502
             LOOK. THE HT-125-F.

150
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,705
      WE NEED TO TURN OFF       
ITS PROTECTIVE SHIELD. BRAINZ!  

151
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:57,275
 DEACTIVATING THE FORCE FIELD   
  BY PUTTING THE COMMAND KEY    

152
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,611
          INTO THE...           
        TWO KEYHOLES?!          

153
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,782
 WE'RE MISSING A KEY.           

154
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,353
WAIT. WHAT'S                    
HE DOING HERE?                  

155
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,689
      HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE       
      GUARDING THE DOOR.        

156
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,324
           INTRUDERS.           

157
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,758
       ( alarm blaring )        

158
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,661
    DON'T MOVE. LORD HATER      
   WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.     

159
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,999
   OH, NO, I DIDN'T.            

160
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,201
   SMASH & SASS.                

161
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,303
       HATER'LL BE HERE         
          ANY SECOND,           

162
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,473
    AND HE'S GONNA TOTALLY      
   CARPET SQUARE ARTICHOKE!     

163
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,543
YOU SAID HE WOULDN'T            
BE A PROBLEM.                   

164
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,312
YOU LET HIM IN,                 
HE LET THAT SCIENCE GUY IN,     

165
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,549
     AND NOW WE GOT HATER       
 COMIN' TO COOK OUR KEISTERS.   

166
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,551
      BRINGING YOU ALONG        
        WAS A MISTAKE.          

167
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,286
         IF WE MAKE IT          
      OUT OF HERE ALIVE,        

168
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,388
 YOU'RE OFF THE TEAM.           

169
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:50,028
      GUYS, DON'T BLAME SYLVIA. 
                      BLAME ME. 

170
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,563
              I WAS A BIG DUMMY 
                       TO THINK 

171
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,232
             I COULD BE AS COOL 
       OR HEROIC AS ANY OF YOU. 

172
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,234
   ESPECIALLY MY BEST FRIEND.   

173
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,239
        I'M NOT A HERO          
        OR A TOUGH GUY.         

174
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:05,644
     I'M JUST A WORTHLESS       
  WANDERING WANDERER, WANDER.   

175
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,746
  AND ALSO A JANITOR.           

176
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,150
           OH, HEY,             
     THE SCIENTIST'S KEYS.      

177
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,685

           THE KEYS!            

178
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,221
        THE SECOND KEY          
       FOR THE CODE BOX.        

179
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,756
       WANDER, GET OVER HERE.   

180
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,393
 LET'S BLOW THIS JOINT.         

181
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,239
     JUST A LITTLE SHORTER.     

182
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:48,553
          ( beeping )           

183
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,388
    GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!     

184
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,499
     THERE'S ONE MORE MESS      
         TO CLEAN UP.           

185
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,435
         WANDER, NO!            

186
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,354
         WOW, WAY TO GO...      

187
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,323
         INSURGENTS!            

188
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,393
  I GET GREAT ENJOYMENT WHEN    
 A PLAN WORKS OUT ACCORDINGLY.  

189
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,562
        HATER MAY HAVE          
       HAD AN EVIL PLAN,        

190
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,231
      AND NOW, BECAUSE OF       
THE BIG JOB WE PULLED OFF TODAY,

191
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,367
     HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE      
     TO HEAT HIS HOT TUB.       

192
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,268
                 WHOA, WHAT NOW?

193
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,804
               HT-125-F HOT TUB.

194
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,674

                  FLARGENHATZ-- 

195
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,177
         JUST THE WAY           
        HATER LIKES IT.         

196
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,913
 YEAH, AND WHO KNOWS.           

197
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,249
MAYBE HE'LL BE SO UPSET         
THAT HIS HOT TUB WON'T WORK     

198
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,251
THAT HE WON'T TRY               
TO TAKE OVER THE UNIVERSE       

199
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,686
OR SOMETHING                    
REALLY EVIL LIKE THAT.          

200
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,354
( laughs )                      
POT HOLDER.                     

201
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,757
       OKAY, NOW I KNOW         
         YOU'RE CRAZY.          

202
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,458
           ( groans )           

203
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,394
HEY, CUT IT OUT.                
HE'S SENSITIVE.                 

204
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,229
WE DON'T WANT                   
HATER MAD AT US.                

205
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,564
    HAVE YOU SEEN THAT GUY?     
          HE'S SCARY.

          INSURGENTS, HO!

208
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,637
        YOU KNOW WHAT?          
      THE NAME'S SYLVIA.        

209
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,273
       AND I'M ALREADY          
   PART OF AN AWESOME TEAM.     

210
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,324
   SYLVIA, LOOK!

CHANGING A TIRE.                

214
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,477

228
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,277

     IT'S LIKE I TOLD YOU,      
            WANDER.             

253
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,953
    THERE'S A TIME TO HELP,     
    AND A TIME TO NOT HELP.     

254
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,321
    ( quiet screeching )        

255
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,424

     SCREE, SCREE, SCREE.       

257
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:52,463

            LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

265
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,796
              IT'S A GOOD THING 
            NOT EVERYBODY NEEDS 
        YOUR HELP ALL THE TIME. 

266
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,397
              WHY?              

267
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,133

                    NO, SYLVIA, 
                  YOU'RE RIGHT. 

272
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,644
                   NOBODY NEEDS 
                ANY HELP TODAY. 

273
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,080

          A MOVIE...            

323
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:07,025
         ABOUT MAKING           
           A MOVIE.             

324
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,263
           ( yells )            

325
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,035
 THERE YOU ARE, WANDER.

      THIS FESTIVE SCARF.

  GOSH, YOU WERE RIGHT, SYL.

A TRIPLE PICKLE CREAM PIE

     and chewing loudly )       

334
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,797

DON'T NEED A-HELPIN'.

                  OF WATCHDOGS, 

339
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,240
     AND TRY TO TAKE OVER       
    THE TOWN OR SOMETHING.

00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,975
          ( slurping )

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,322
     CHECK, PLEASE?
