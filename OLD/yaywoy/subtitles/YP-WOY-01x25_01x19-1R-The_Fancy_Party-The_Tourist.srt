Ooh, it was terrific, but it was
  no Arooga-dingle-ling-ling.   

229
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,551
          You've been           
to Arooga-dingle-ling-ling, too?

230
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,653
  Sylvia, isn't this amazing?   

231
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,023
    SYLVIA: Uh, it sure is.     

232
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,492
WAITER: Welcome                 
to Planet Ziziks.               

233
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:41,559
 What will it be?               

234
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,895
          One Flarvarian float, 
                    two straws. 

235
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,864
                I can't believe 
                    you've been 

236
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,799
                             to 
  Arooga-dingle-ling-ling-ling. 

237
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,568
       And a translation guide, 
                if you got one. 

238
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,537
Sylvia, I met                   
another wanderer.               

239
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,706
Can you believe she's           
been to as many places          

240
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,708
 in the universe as me?         

241
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,548
Name's Trudy, Trudy Traveler,   
and I'm pleased                 

242
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,049
as punch to meetcha             
and greetcha.                   

243
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,417
                 Yeah, likewise.

244
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,052
  Ooh, and speaking of punch,   

245
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,688
      when you went to Glowerp, 
          did you see the Pbbt? 

246
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,423
                 And the Rawr?  

247
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,792
         And the Bzzt?          

248
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,960
              WAITER: I'll just 
                leave it there. 

249
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,864
       I loved the Pbbt         
         and the Rawr,          

250
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,968
         and the Bzzt,          
and the Flooshy Slooshy Sloosh. 

251
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,472
            I loved             
  the Flooshy Slooshy Sloosh.   

252
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,807
  Wait a minute.                

253
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,875
         I didn't see           
  the Flooshy Slooshy Sloosh.   

254
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,978
Well, you're young.             
You'll catch up someday.        

255
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,847
Anywho, I should toodles.       

256
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,449
Places to go, sights to see,    
             you understand.    

257
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,585
 Or do you?                     

258
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,559
          ( sighing )           

259
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,595
      Nothing like a Flarvarian 
             float to start off 

260
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,530
          a relaxing vacay, huh?

261
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,735
Aww. I can't stop thinking about
the Flooshy Slooshy Sloosh.     

262
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,638
         You really want to see 
    the Flooshy Slooshy thingy? 

263
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,576
Well, then come on.             

264
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,778
 Let's go. The vacay can wait.  

265
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,880
               Sylvia's awesome.

266
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,554
                I got to admit, 
              this is exciting. 

267
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,604
        That thing seem         
        slow to anyone?         

268
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,528
       Ooh!                     

269
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,529
              Well, that's done.

270
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,530
                       Let's go.

271
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,099
   Happy, Wander?               

272
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,801
           You got your Flooshy 
                 Slooshy thingy 

273
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,405
  and I got my Flarvarian float 
 waiting for me back on Ziziks. 

274
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,875
                 Let's get this 
                 vacay underway.

275
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:14,612
   Well, isn't this a treat?    
   Where y'all coming from?     

276
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,748
        We just saw Old Flooshy.

277
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,583
My favorite part                
was the slooshing.              

278
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,584
             And now we're even.

279
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,853
        Isn't that nice?        

280
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,956
   By the by, while you were    
    off seeing Old Slooshy,     

281
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,592
    I toured the Museum of      
    Ginormous Antiquities.      

282
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,528
     I tasted the galaxy's      
        biggest hoagie.         

283
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,131
          And stayed            
   at a fancy-shmancy hotel.    

284
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,632
     Seasoned traveler like you,

285
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,968
             surely you've been 
           to all those places? 

286
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,606
        Gee, whackers.          
       I'm no math whiz,        

287
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,609
          but I think           
     that means I'm ahead       

288
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,710
           by three.            

289
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,612
                     Toodles.   

290
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,650
       Not that it's a contest, 
         that'd be silly-willy. 

291
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,120
         But if it was,         

292
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,656
                   I am winning.

293
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,964
So who's parched,               
aside from me?                  

294
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,600
      I want to eat, see,       
   and stay at those places,    

295
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,235
         respectively.          

296
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,105
Wander, you're not getting      
competitive, are you?           

297
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:18,209
          Sylvia, I am offended 
            at the implication. 

298
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:22,513
         I am simply expressing 
           a natural curiosity. 

299
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,848
     Yeah, all right, all right.

300
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,583
        Don't get your          
       socks in a bunch.        

301
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,686
      Uh, I guess they do       
   sound like fun side-trips    

302
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,254
   and the vacay can wait.      

303
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,258
But soon as we're done,         
we're headed straight back      

304
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,561
    to Ziziks for my float,     
            got it?             

305
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,029
                Yeah-yeah-yeah, 
                    sure, fine. 

306
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,164
                      Just hang 
             a right and ignore 
               the speed limit. 

307
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,537
                    It's so big.

308
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,673
 It's so big.                   

309
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,852
    Beautiful, impressive,      
          inspiring,            

310
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,320
        just as good as         
        the real thing.         

311
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:04,722
                   Hey!         

312
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,726
                Then again,     
           I am kind of peckish.

313
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,565
( burping )                     

314
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,633
Check please.                   

315
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,906
  SYLVIA: If you think a stay   
      at Fancy Shmancy's        

316
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,675
   Fancy Hotel will make up     
  for you eating my dinner--    

317
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,544
             Ooh!               
        There's a spa.          

318
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,547
BELLHOP: Enjoy your stay.       
        We will.                

319
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,716
            We did.             
           We what?             

320
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,619
WANDER: Trudy was right,        
those places were amazing.      

321
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,554
          Were they?            
       I wouldn't know.         

322
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,624
Take it from me, one of the     
two most traveled folks         

323
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,259
in the universe, they were.     

324
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,896
              I really          
      hate that sound.          

325
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,598
       Well, isn't this         
       a nice surprise?         

326
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,332
           Isn't it?            

327
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,667
             It is.             

328
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,336
                We just got back

329
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:55,039
         from those three great 
      places you told us about. 

330
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,041
                  Well, I guess 
            that'd make us tied 

331
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,343
     if I hadn't just gone      
         to five more.          

332
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,949
WANDER: Impressive.             

333
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,350
Impossible!                     

334
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,619
She drives at the speed         
of dusty molasses.              

335
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,058
             Five.              

336
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,201
   I want to climb, observe,    
   witness, enjoy, and ride     

337
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,937
   those things, respectively.  

338
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,939
        Wander, I don't         
         think it's--           

339
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,740
         Please.                

340
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,112
            No. No.             
            Uh-uh.              

341
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,179
No way.                         
Not gonna--                     

342
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,384
  Okay. But only if you agree   
   to take it nice and slow.    

343
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,853
   Deal?                        

344
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,121
   Eeee!                        

345
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,755
               Let's go.        

346
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,291
I'm sensing                     
a troubling pattern here.       

347
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,760
The Temple of                   
Backalakabingbong               

348
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,996
was a place of solemnity        
and fortitude.                  

349
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,264
                   WANDER: Done.

350
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,200
         The delicate Tardilius 
           plant blooms hourly, 

351
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,736
       awakening slowly to show 
           its splendid petals. 

352
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,205
             Done.              

353
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,242
The courtship ritual            
of the Lorb requires patience.  

354
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,376
Done.                           

355
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,211
         The Klerblatz ceremony 
             you are witnessing 

356
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,946
         has been unchanged for 
            thousands of years. 

357
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,184
            Done.               

358
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,919
      <i>BUS DRIVER: And now</i>       
  <i>we are entering Shatterton,</i>   

359
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,687
         <i>the town made</i>          
       <i>entirely of glass.</i>       

360
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,356
 Of course, we are.             

361
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,391
  We better take it slow or--   

362
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,900
         WANDER: Done.          

363
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,436
      I think we're clear.      

364
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,437
                           Gah! 

365
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,939
       Well, howdy hoo.         

366
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:38,442
       Five, I saw five.        
             Five.              

367
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,445
              Oh.               
       I only saw four.         

368
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,446
            Really?             

369
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,349
             Tee.               
           Four-tee.            

370
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,751
           Forty.               

371
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,389
Got it.                         
Hee-yahh!                       

372
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,723
Hee-yahh?                       

373
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,398
       WANDER: Seen it,         
       saw it, done it,         

374
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,433
      did it, yep, yeah,        
          sure, fine.           

375
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,834
         Good, great,           
        got it, win it.         

376
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,836
        Victory will be mine.   

377
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,471
        ( Sylvia panting )      

378
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,778
                You're a worthy 
              opponent, Wander. 

379
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,347
          Seems we are now even.

380
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,050
              I don't do even.  

381
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,719
      Planet Pharphlung,        
        you, me, there,         

382
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,787
        now!                    

383
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,288
    You're on.                  

384
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,024
       Let's go, Sylvia.        

385
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,493
      Come on!                  

386
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,330
            Adventure,          
sights exploring, fun!          

387
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,832
         My feet hurt.          
          I'm tired.            

388
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,034
  I don't even want to think    
    about how thirsty I am.     

389
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,070
           Ugh, now             
    I'm thinking about it.      

390
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,839
  You got to choose, Wander.    
        It's her or m--         

391
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,070
                    ( groaning )

392
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,075
             Gah!               

393
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:31,289
         <i>WANDER: Oh my.</i>         
   <i>It's the birth of a star.</i>    

394
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,357
        <i>It's so beautiful.</i>      

395
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,129
                    Puts things 
                in perspective, 
                    doesn't it? 

396
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,365
       I-- I don't know         
         what to say.           

397
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,004
                 Actually, I do.

398
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,439
Eat it, Fuzzball.               

399
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,846
     I've been doing this       
          all wrong.            

400
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,055
WAITER:                         
One Flarvarian float, one straw.

401
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,990
             Better make it two.

402
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,425
 Wander.                        

403
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,094
          Sylvia, I am so sorry.

404
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,196
             I got so caught up 
              in proving myself 

405
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:16,300
      the most traveled tourist 
        in the entire universe! 

406
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,235
        I forgot the real reason

407
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,304
               I love wandering 
            in the first place. 

408
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:23,107
             The roses you stop 
      and smell aren't as sweet 

409
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:26,110
          without your best pal 
          to smell it with you. 

410
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:29,046
Aw, man, what are you           
trying to do to me              

411
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,315
with all the                    
sappy sappiness?                

412
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,951
Garcon,  one more straw.        

413
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,304
         Where are you?         

414
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,005
     Did you find him yet,      
            Trudy?              

415
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,374
             Nope.              
        Did you, Trudy?         

416
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,075
             Nope.              
        Did you, Trudy?         

417
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,377
             Nope.              
          You, Trudy?           

418
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,644
                   Nope.        
           How about you, Trudy?

419
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,613
          Nah.                  
      Any luck, Trudy?          

420
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,081
             Sorry, Trudy, nope.

421
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,182
You?                            
What?                           

422
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,451
        How about you?          
           You? You?            

423
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,453
             Ugh,               
     we'll never find him.      

424
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,455
             Give it up, Trudy. 
          Technically speaking, 

425
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,090
        the furry fella did win.

426
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,092
  TRUDIES: Oh, just stow it,    
       would you, Trudy?        

427
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,662
         Destroy them!          

428
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,472
       ( horse neighing )       

429
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,244
       ( engine revving )       

430
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,681
     ( soft music playing )
