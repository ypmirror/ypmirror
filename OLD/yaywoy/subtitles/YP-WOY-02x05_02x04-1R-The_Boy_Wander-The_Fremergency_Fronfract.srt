   my femergency frontact,      

35
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:42,000
       then we must be          
        best friends.           

36
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,836
There's a slight chance         
the sting of the painkillers    

37
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,170
has scrambled                   
his brain a bit.

00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,839
It should wear off,             
but until then,                 

39
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:49,374
it's important you see          
that he gets home safe.         

40
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:53,112
        I love you guys.

00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,380
 Okay, this is weird.

        I know, I know.

     Hater's not actually       
       my best friend.          

44
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,228
That's just a gajillion volts   
  of electric squid talking.    

45
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,330
My mouth feels                  
like purple.                    

46
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,233
          - Exactly.            
 - And the smart thing to do    

47
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,402
     - is get him safely        
      back to his ship.         
            - Yep.              

48
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,905
     It's not like having       
     a day of fun with us       

49
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,974
      would cause Hater         
          to realize            

50
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,076
    that being a good guy       
        is way better           

51
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,878
     than being a bad guy.      

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,046
    - That would be crazy.      
          - I know.             

53
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,649
Maybe this bonding experience   
    would actually make us      

54
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,651
      become best friends       

55
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,319
     and we can hang out        
       and help people,         

56
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,989
       and have our own         
   secret friend language,      

57
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,091
  and people would be, like,    
"What are they talking about?"  

58
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,692
                   What are you 
                 talking about? 

59
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,694
And I could be, like,           
Glee-bibble-glorp, Hatey!"      

60
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,930

"Slamdibble-doo, Wandey!"

                     HATER: Hey!

62
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,969

112
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:44,109
   I'm not sure I even know     
         who you are.           

113
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:47,412
          Look at me            
  like a kid out of school,     

114
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,448
    hanging out with a fool.    

115
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,519
      A fool who I think        
   is actually kinda cool.      

116
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,054
    I don't think he knows      
    he's talkin' out loud.      

117
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,222
      I'm countin' on it.       

118
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,991
              Why am I starting 
                      to drool? 

119
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,193
    Okay, this has been fun,    

120
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,894
    and more importantly,       
          hilarious.            

121
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,130
        But we really           
    have to take him back.      

122
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,233
     But he hasn't tried        
 to destroy us once all day.    

123
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,535
    But who knows how long      
his brains'll stay scrambled?   

124
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,537
  You can't force him to be     
     something he's not.        

125
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,240
     But what if this is        
     our chance to prove        

126
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,409
    that deep, deep, deep,      
deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,   

127
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:21,113
      ( voice deepens )         
 deep, deep, deep, deep down,   

128
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,915
      Hater's an okay guy?      

129
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,951
         ( screaming )          

130
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,519
            Because he's not.   

131
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,155
     No! Bad Lord Hater.        
             Bad!               

132
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,290

133
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,659
    Thanks for the boost,       
          Mr. Hater.            

134
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,261
       No problem, Olive.       

135
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,331
          Good luck             
    on that spelling test.      

136
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,402
    Oh, what is this warm       
       feeling inside?          

137
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,003
        Is it heartburn?        

138
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,105
             That's the feeling

      Are you down there?       

164
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,599
      What is that thing?       

165
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,402
     It looks... familiar.      

166
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:52,537
        It's nothing.

167
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,105

168
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,974
   No, stay perfectly still.    

169
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,709
     No, let's check him        
         for cavities           

170
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,377

00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,513

         from now on.           

172
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,448
                  I don't wanna 
                   go up there. 
                    It's scary. 

173

zapped harder than we thought.  

176
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,424
                    Ooh, I know.

177
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,526
      All we have to do         
is dishwash the tinkle kitten   

178
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,161
              until the bandage 
                 is impossible, 

179
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,997
                      and we're 
          floppin' crone scone.

181
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,435
         No, we gotta           
        take you back.          

182
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:27,506
   I wanna be your friend,      
      but not like this.        

183
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,708
       True friendship          
    comes from the heart,       

184
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,477
not an electric squid           
to the face.                    

185
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,413
        Come on, pal.           
  I had a fun day with you.     

186
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:39,551
 But a true emergency contact   
delivers his friend home safe.  

187
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,158
I know you don't                
want to,                        

188
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,227
 but you gotta go.              

189
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,497
         We'll be fine.         

190
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,243
          It's over!            
         Go on. Get.            

191
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,049

224
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,846
               Pillows get flat 
                  all the time. 

225
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,381
           Exhibit A.           

226
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,615
              A whoopee cushion?

227
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,217
A message.                      
The calling card                

228
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,486
of the most villainous          
villain to vex this             

229
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,321
 or any other galaxy.           

230
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,456
        ( air escapes )         

231
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,524
                    Lord Hater? 
               Emperor Awesome? 

232
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,492
     It's not Dominator,        
            is it?              

233
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,560
             Worse.             

234
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,528
     Someone from my past,      

235
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,697
someone who thinks he's good,   
      but is really bad.        

236
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,432
         Good news is           
we're gonna stop this bad guy   

237
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,934
     from doing any more        
          bad things            

238
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,869
          he thinks             
      are actually good.        

239
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,874
              Since when do you 
                 stop bad guys? 

240
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:27,278
        Usually you sing a song 
        or play some silly game 
             to drive 'em nuts. 

241
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,513
( imitating Batman )            
This is no game.                

242
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,952
                What?           

243
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,256
         ( evil laugh )         

244
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,463
       ( alarm sounding )       

245
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,398
       ( sirens blaring )       

246
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,501
   ( makes whooshing sounds )   

247
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,542
     What's the trouble?        
      Snatched statues?         

248
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:58,843
       Ransacked rubies?        

249
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,445
       Misappropriated          
        masterpieces?           

250
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,880
         What? Oh, no.          

251
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,481
      Someone just stole        
     the display pillows        

252
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,450
      from our gemstone         
           exhibit.             

253
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,954
          It's worse            
       than we thought.         

254
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,623
                   It is?       

255
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,424
         I mean, it is!         

256
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,530
I'm gonna need                  
full background checks          
on all museum visitors.         

257
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:21,466
Get me names,                   
birthdays, favorite colors,     
summer vacation plans.          

258
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,768
According to the footage,       
our pernicious pillow pilferer  

259
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,538
         - struck at            
       precisely 3:14.          
            - So?               

260
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,506
      3.14 are the first        
         three digits           

261
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,408
       in the numerical         
        value for pi.           

262
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,777
      Pie is delicious,         
  which rhymes with wishes.     

263
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,513
    If wishes were fishes,      
 we'd all have enough to eat.   

264
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,482
      I know where he's         
    going to strike next.       

265
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,584
     - Quickly, old chum.       
         - Old chum?            

266
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:54,098
Now I get it.                   

267
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,902
Emperor Awesome                 
is sabotaging all the pillows   

268
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,405
so he can throw                 
an evil slumber party...        

269
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,640
and I don't get it.             

270
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,844
    You have a rather extensive 
          collection of feather 
              boas, do you not? 

271
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,512
        Where are they?         

272
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,548
    Feather boas are so out.    

273
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,984
      Now it's all about        
         actual boas.           

274
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,920
     I threw those ratty        
      feather ones away.        

275
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,489
        Curses. Empty.          
       We're too late.          

276
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,592
          But he left a message.

277
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,763
 Wander, wait for me.           

278
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,466
        What's your hurry, becs?

279
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,068
           Oh, gross.           

280
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,812
        ( evil laughter)        

281
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,081
     Despair, citizens of       
           Cluckon.             

282
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,651
  Your inevitable domination    
         is... gaaah!           

283
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,586
           Oh, gross!           

284
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,522
      Peepers, I can see        
        their nuggets.          

285
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,631
                   Ah, finally. 
                A villain I can 

286
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,466
sink my fists into.             

287
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,001
 Not so fast.                   

288
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,136
         Oh, come on.           
       It's Lord Hater.         

289
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,772
   He's like the definition     
         of bad guy.            

290
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,607
              ( whooshing)      

291
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,576
                        Go away!

292
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,578
 And yet, he's small potatoes   
     in the baneful broth       

293
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,481
    of the real villain's       
     gumbo of repugnance.       

294
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,982
Gumbo of...                     
Okay, that's it.                

295
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,485
I am sick of                    
the grim and gritty routine,    

296
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,553
     and getting dragged        
      across the galaxy         

297
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,122
       for some missing         
           pillows,             

298
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,990
        frilly scarves          
    and plucked Cluckons.       

299
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,126
           It's not             
       that big a deal.         

300
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,895
I'm not moving until you tell me
    who we're up against.       

301
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,632
                  Him.          

302
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,934
       Attention, galaxy.       

303
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,671
         My fowl plan           
     is almost complete.        

304
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,980
       Prepare to face          
 the wrath of the mischievous   

305
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,749
      Dr. Screwball Jones.      

306
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,490
        Now tremble in          
    eggs-cruciating terror      

307
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,493
      as my latest plot         
  leaves you shell-shocked.     

308
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,530
   Behold my fantabulously      
         fantabulous            

309
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,465
        tickle machine.         

310
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,502
This joker                      
is who you think                

311
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,538
is the most dangerous           
villain in the galaxy?          

312
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,939
        HATER: He what?         

313
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,575
     Of course. He stole        
      all those feathers        

314
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,811
             in order to create 
            a weapon that would 
           make everyone laugh, 

315
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,547
  thus forcing the universe     
         to be happy.           

316
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,148
Isn't that like                 
your whole deal?                

317
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,717
        I only present          
      the positive path.        

318
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,852
      I don't force you         
        to follow it.           

319
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,864
  ( giggling )                  

320
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,500
This is kinda fun,              
in a baby way.                  

321
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,869
Okay, I get it.                 

322
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:49,574
        ( all laughing )        

323
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,509
         That's enough.         

324
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,144
          All right,            
    it's getting annoying.      

325
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,912
           Quit it.             
         ( laughing )           

326
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,282
         Stop! Please           
        make it stop.           

327
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,918
This is the worst thing         
that's ever happened...         

328
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,954
          ( laughing )          

329
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,262
       I guess this is          
     no laughing matter.        

330
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,997
   Get it, because of the...    

331
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,298
    Great. Now he's got me      
          doing it.             

332
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,877
        Hey, Chuckles.          
  I got a punchline for you.    

333
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,745
   Then you'll need a set-up.   

334
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,747
      What's worse than         
      a tickle machine?         

335
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,315
      Literally anything.       

336
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:34,085
            Wrong!              
     Two tickle machines.       

337
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,022
     Oh, please. Too bad        
      I'm not ticklish.         

338
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,024
          Except for            
       behind my knees.         

339
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,793
          ( laughing )          

340
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,629
  Holy somatosense, Wander.     
        This is awful.          

341
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,798
        He is a monster.        

342
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,037
              Huh?              

343
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,173
   - WANDER: Knock, knock.      
    - JONES: Who's there?       

344
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,341
          - Orange.             
        - Orange who?           

345
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:00,244
       Orange you glad          
     I didn't say banana?       

346
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,018
No need to split.               

347
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,754
You might find this             
a-peeling.                      

348
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,323

        Seeing stars?

351
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600

352
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,002
