00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,910
       Oh, this is great.       

23
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,845
    This place is so small

24
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,713
      that no one knows

00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,585
         It sure is.            
  I'm gonna record a review,    

27
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,754
    and let everyone know       
      about this planet         

28
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,722
     so they can all come       
      and enjoy it, too.

00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,891
No, not so fast, pal.           
We can't tell anyone.           

30
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,726
      If word gets out,         
 then Dominator will show up    

31
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,095
      and ruin this place.      

32
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,698
This has to be                  
our little secret, okay?        

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,667
       Sh!                      

34
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,805
        Oh, a secret.           

35
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,607
      I can keep a secret.      

36
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,810
     It's no secret that        
 I am a great secret keeper.    

37
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,580
     Mm-hmm. I'm gonna go       
    figure out a shelter.       

38
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,616
           Just remember... sh! 

39
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,486
         ( whispers )           
           Secret.              

40
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,290
     Oh, I'm sure they've       
  got things under control.     

41
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,459
     Yeah, they're fine.        

42
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,270
                       What are 
                     you doing? 

43
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,272
    Oh, nothing.                

44
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,241
    Just... doing a dance       

45
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,776
to celebrate finding this still 
    totally secret planet.      

46
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,645
  Yeah, well, tone it down.     

47
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,481
You haven't said anything about 
this planet to anyone, have you?

48
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,850
Said   anything? No.            

49
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,486
                Good job, buddy.

50
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,921
  Now why don't you help out    
 and gather some palm fronds    

51
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,656
     - for the thatching.       
       - Yes, perfect.          

52
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,491
   It will give me a chance     
      to go check on...         

53
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,795
          all the other secrets 
             this secret planet 

54
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,297
                  has to offer. 

55
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,698
                            Sh! 

56
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,536
             Hello.             

57
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,473
Is everyone okay                
over here?                      

58
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,875
      Oh, it's the king         
        of the planet.          

59
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,877
   King? Oh, no, I'm not--      

60
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,046
       O gracious king,         
      have mercy on us.         

61
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,814
    We are but poor refugees    

62
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,783
  fleeing the crushing might    
        of Dominator.           

63
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,685
      Give us sanctuary,        
        we beg of you.          

64
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,987
       Well, of course          
        you can stay.           

65
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,956
       But can you keep         
       your voices down         

66
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,491
   just a little because--      

67
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,359
   The king has granted us      
          sanctuary.            

68
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,496
        Let us raise our voices 
                  in tribute to 
              his graciousness. 

69
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,398
           Huzzah!

    ♪ Hail to the king!         

72
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,039
   Wise and generous king,      

73
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,974
we have prepared a lavish feast 
        in your honor.          

74
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,876
        Well, that was          
       very kind of you         

75
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,077
           I really             
      don't want any...         

76
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,681
    The king is displeased      
       with the feast.          

77
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,917
   Prepare a bigger feast!      

78
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,452
       No, no. I meant...       

79
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,159
              ( squealing )     

80
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,494
    It was very thoughtful      
of you to prepare this feast,   

81
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,496
     and it will be quite       
       adequate for me          

82
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,266
          to satisfy            
      my kingly hunger.         

83
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:58,437
     I'm just going to go       
   eat this in the jungle.      

84
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,906
        If you please,          
      just keep it down.        

85
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:09,047
             (European accent ) 
            Ugh, the service at 
       this resort is terrible. 

86
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,850
We've been waiting              
for at least two minutes.       

87
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,885
      I'm going to find         
         the manager.           

88
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,687
       I will give him          
     a piece of my mind.        

89
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,091
     Yes, and make a big,       
     loud fuss doing it.        

90
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,928
      Harumph. Harumph,         
           harumph!             

91
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,796
Thank you for                   
your patience, monsieur.        

92
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,799
If you'll come this way,        
I will show you to              
your table.                     

93
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,869
We saw your fire pit            
as we were passing by.          

94
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,774
This is a most charming         
resort you have.                

95
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,443

  Clancy and Nancy Schmancy     

96

97
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,147
                  We too are in 
           the resort business. 

98
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,982
   <i>Oui.  </i> Very good, monsieur.  

99

for you to whip me up           
a couple of fruity drinks?      

107
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,310

    Thank you.                  

109
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,913
 This will do nicely.

 Hey, thanks, buddy.            

114
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,931
    I am parched.

     Only the best fronds       
     for my best friend.

126
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,565
     Much too bright for        
such a lovely moonlit night, no?

127
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,567
 Ahem.                          

128
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,871
The Fancy Schmancys

129
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,084
Wow! Good thing we saw          
that fire and that disco party, 

130
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:29,087
or we totally would've          
missed this secret and          
exotic planet.                  

131
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,957
    Dad, when are we gonna      
      see some animals?         

132
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,061
DAD: Look, a wild               
Zbornak.                        

133
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,997
             Sh. Don't spook it 
                      now, son. 

134
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,299
    ( making monkey sounds )    

135
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,070
        Whoa, monkey!           

136
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,949
       Hey, that monkey         
     stole my juice box.

00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,996
              <i>Danke.</i>

00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,967
          <i>Sacre bleu!</i>           

140
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,438
   We'll put the pool here,     
 and the hot tubs over there,   

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,308
          and I think sun lamps 
         everywhere so it won't 
       be so dark all the time. 

142
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,946
We are going to make this       
the hottest new vacation spot.  

143
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,856
      If only there were        
     a real estate agent.       

144
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,726
       As you can see,          
   these distant foothills      

145
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,562
     are the perfect spot       
       for your resort.         

146
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,931
    Great views and plenty      
    of room for expansion.      

147
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,834
          And most importantly, 
          as far from the beach 
                   as possible. 

148
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,135
     <i>Ja,  </i> that is perfect.     

149
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,837
            Whew!               

150
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,172
        - Men, blow up          
        the foothills.          
           - What?!             

151
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,449
  These are Dominator's spies,  

152
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,184
   sent to threaten our king.   

153
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,988
           Wander!              

154
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,424
King disco monkey want          
schmancy palm fronds!           

155
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,060
             What in flarnation 
                   is going on? 

156
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,096
 Be right back.                 

157
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,033
   Wander, are you keeping      
       secrets from me?         

158
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,136
No. Yes. I mean,                
I was trying to keep            
the planet a secret,            

159
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,505
but then there were             
these people who needed help,   

160
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,106
so I told them                  
about the planet,               

161
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,141
and they built a fire           
to me, their king,              

162
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,143
and then more people came,      
so in an attempt to keep        
all of them secret              

163
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,012
naturally I had to be           
a waiter, a monkey,             
and a real estate agent         

164
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,047
and now                         
they're all fighting,           

165
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,116
and it's all my fault           
and I never did get you         
those palm friends,             

166
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,851
 because I'm a bad frond,       

167
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,188
but worst of all                
I'm a big ol' liar.             

168
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,028
   Okay, I'm gonna pretend      
      I understood that,        

169
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,030
         and focus on           
     the problem at hand.       

170
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,633
             All this commotion 
               is gonna attract 
         Dominator's attention! 

171
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,635
I don't think                   
we're attracting                
that much attention.            

172
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:05,644
    Buddy, it's time to fess up 
              and fix all this. 

173
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,080
            I have a confession 
                       to make. 

174
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,683
          I'm not really a king.

175
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:12,884
           Waiter.              

176
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,085
           Monkey.              

177
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,421
   - Or real estate agent.      
         - ( gasps )            

178
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,558
      I'm just a goofy,         
      wandering wanderer        

179
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,426
      who wanders around        
          the galaxy            

180
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,262
    trying to help people       
  and make a mess of things     

181
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,931
      like I did today.         

182
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,866
             Sorry.             

183
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,068
      Wait. You're Wander?      

184
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,003
    We've heard tell of you.    

185
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,272
        - So have we.           
           -   <i>Ja.</i>              

186
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,507
          We all have.          

187
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,008
                  You've helped 
                so many people. 

188
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,276
          How can we            
          help you?             

189
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,381
      ( all screaming )         

190
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,616
         The lights!            

191
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,701
         The statue!            

192
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,148
  - ( all cheering loudly )     
            - Sh!               

193
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,651
      ( cheering quietly )      

194
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,586
  WANDER: But how can folks     
        stay here now?          

195
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,222
If we light the place up again, 
    Dominator will see us.      

196
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,091
              I've got a secret.

197
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,759
      Ooh, that's nice,         
           Sylvia,              

198
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,829
     but I don't know how       
      we're all gonna...        

199
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,565
    Knowing you, I assumed      
      we'd have guests.         

200
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,133
     ( happy squealing )        

201
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,141
       Help, Dominator.         
          Sanctuary.            

202
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,843
      What's the password?      

203
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,380
       The monkey stole         
        my juice box.           

204
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,324
     Best secret hideaway       
            ever!               

205
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,593
         Some secrets           
      are worth sharing.        

206
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,644
Sir, what were you thinking,    
giving Dominator flowers?       

207
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,946
            Girls are supposed  
               to like flowers. 

208
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,815
    It's her stupid fault       
    she doesn't know that.      

209
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,383
     Should've given her        
        a cooler gift,          

210
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,519
       like chocolates,         
     or maybe a toaster.        

211
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,021
       No. No presents          
        for the enemy.          

212
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,263
         ( snoring )            

213
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,263
        Wake up, Syl.           
  It's a beautiful morning.     

214
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,867
     I got just the thing       
    to stop your snornin'!      

215
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,569
           Oh, no!              

216
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,504
      Where's my banjo?         

217
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,372
                     Banjo?     

218
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,409
                         Banjo! 

219
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,478
                    Banjo?      

220
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,383
          Uh, buddy,            
       everything okay?         

221
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,018
              Where's my banjo? 

222
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,620
Banjo?                          
Where's your hat?               

223
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,489
     Oh, no, my chapeau!        

224
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,394
           Now I want you to go 
         to your room and think 
        about what you've done. 

225
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:46,231
          Oh, yeah?             
     You go to your room.       

226
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,866
         Think about            
      what you've done.         

227
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,868
          Love killer!          

228
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,470
        Stupid Peepers          
    doesn't understand me.      

229
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,472
      Doesn't care about        
          my needs.             

230
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,209
     Oh, no, no, no, no.        

231
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,478
      Wander, I'm really        
       upset right now.         

232
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,814
    The last thing I need       
is your stupid sunshine games.  

233
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,483
      Get out of there!         

234
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,519
         What the what?         

235
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,422
          Oh, yeah.             
     That hits the spot.        

236
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,258
           Kinda dry.           

237
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,393
      Wander, if this is        
     some kind of trick.        

238
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,667
     Oh, this is exactly        
        what I needed.          

239
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,002
         Oh, my grop,           
         it's magic!            

240
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:30,041
  It's a magic hat that can     
give me exactly what I need...  

241
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,345
    to impress Dominator.       

242
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,252
 Ah, silly me, it's probably    
       under this rock.         

243
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,656
           Or maybe             
       under this rock.         

244
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,293
           I know.              
    It's under this rock.       

245
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,861
        Or this rock.           
        Or this rock.           

246
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,430
        Or this rock.           
      Or this rock or...        

247
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,332
          Maybe try             
    retracing your steps.       

248
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,367
      Super duper idea.         

249
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,436
    We'll just orbble back      
    to the last planet...       

250
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,139
    No hat, no orbble juice.    

251
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,141
        Then I'll just          
       check the map...         

252
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,710
       No hat, no map.          

253
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:11,716
 Okay, an inspirational ditty   
  should lift my spirits...     

254
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,218
      No hat, no banjo.         

255
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,954
   No hat! No hat, no map.      
   no hat, no orbble juice.     

256
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:21,192
     No hat, no Wander!!        

257
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,561
    Easy, buddy.                
    Easy.                       

258
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,396
         The hat is             
        just a thing.           

259
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,399
I've never known you            
to get so worked up             
over stuff.                     

260
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,202
    You're right, Sylvia.       

261
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,538
     It's only a silly hat.     

262
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,039
       That's the spirit.       

263
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,476
Oh, grop.                       
Gotta find that hat.            

264
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,183
         So, magic hat.         

265

      I have this friend

00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,521
  And I... I mean, my friend    
   kind of likes this girl.     

268
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,523
      And I... I mean,          
       he was wondering         

269
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,593
 what one would need to make    
her fall in love with me. Him!

315
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,707
      Can you pull stuff        
          out of it?            

316
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,542
          Of course.            
          Go ahead.

318

      Just like my hat.         
 What else will it give you?    

319
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,582
     Items that you need        
    and not what you want,      

320
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,985
   forcing you to improvise     
and take things as they come,   

321
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,653
   sort of like a physical      
manifestation of the challenges

00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:36,921
     we all face in life?       
           A banjo?             

323
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,157

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,659
But it's magic?                 

325
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,594
       Not real magic.

00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,363
      You know how rare         
          those are?            

327
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,031
     Son, if I had a real       
          magic hat,            

328
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,667
       I'd never let it         
    out of my sight ever.       

329
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,302
( squealing )                   

330
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,506
           ( coughs )           

331
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,578
    Mrs. Dominator Hater.       

332
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,881
      Hey, hat, monogram        
some Mrs. Hater towels for me.  

333
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,483
           Thanks.              

334
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,986
                  ( hat coughs )

335
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,724
 Sir, a unicorn is chewing up   
       the engine room.         

336
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,693
       What is going on?!       

337
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,062
          ( gasps )             
 Is that what I think it is?    

338
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,698
     It's not a magical,        
         mystical hat           

339
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,601
   that gives you anything      
     you want, if that's        
    what you're implying.       

340
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,771
     Shut up, it's mine!        
     I need it to conquer       
      Dominator's heart.        

341
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,239
       Conquer her heart?       

342
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,408
       We can use this          
   to actually conquer her.     

343
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,977
        But it's really good at 
          making lady presents. 

344
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,646
Forget presents.                
We can make super weapons.      

345
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,815
        Gifts, gifts.           

346
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,451
  Nightgowns and baby dolls     
      and leg hair wax.         

347
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,653
      She will be mine!         

348
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,155
      Weapons, weapons.         

349
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,491
 Bazookas and laser blasters    
      and sonic cannons.        

350
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,559
         The universe           
        will be mine!           

351
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,137
             Uh-oh.             

352
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,782
        Really? You're          
      sure you're fine?         

353
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,785
Yeah. I just have               
to face we're not               
gonna find my hat,              

354
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,020
and I'll never                  
replace it.                     

355
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,656
But knowing that                
old hat,                        

356
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,958
it's probably out there         
helping some other              
deserving soul                  

357
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,261
who needs it                    
more than me.                   

358
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,764
I guess, from now on,           
I'm just regular old Wander,    

359
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,667
the guy with nothing            
on his noggin.                  

360
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,403
       Oh. Did not see          
         that coming.           

361
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,150
     My hat!                    

362
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,486
    Whoa, whoa, what makes      
you think the hat is up there?  

363
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,954
'Cause this is                  
exactly what happened           

364
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,956
      - when I stole it.        
       - When you what?         

365
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,491
      You stole something?      

366
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,293
        Back in my past,        

367
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,528
    I wandered to a galaxy      
in the middle of a civil war.   

368
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,531
       <i>Two former allies</i>        
      <i>discovered the hat</i>        

369
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,366
        <i>could give them</i>         
       <i>wonderful things,</i>        

370
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,802
    <i>but they got too greedy</i>     
<i>and turned against each other.</i>  

371
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,881
         <i>In an attempt</i>          
    <i>to conquer the galaxy,</i>      

372
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,083
    <i>they forced the hat to</i>      
<i>give them whatever they wanted</i>  

373
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,053
   <i>without a thought to how</i>     
<i>the poor, helpless hat felt.</i>    

374
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,692
    I felt so bad for it,       
I did the only thing I could.   

375
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,061
    I took it, and kept it      
       safe on my head.         

376
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,663
Eventually, it learned          
to trust me                     

377
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,098
and was nice enough             
to help me.                     

378
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,734
      - And right now...        
    - We need to help it.       

379
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,803
But how? We don't               
have orbble juice.              

380
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,940
        ( whinnying )           

381
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,093
        ( shrieking )           
What do we do, what do we do?   

382
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,529
        Sir, get rid of the hat.

383
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,565
     But I still haven't        
  found the perfect thing--     

384
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,799
              Sir!              

385
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,203
  My hat!                       

386
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,038
 Hey, Hater.                    

387
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,941
I was wondering,                
if it's not too much trouble,   

388
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,376
    - if I could get my--       
          - Take it.            

389
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,878
      - Oh. Hey, thanks.        
     - Sure. No problem.        

390
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,313
 - That's really nice of you.   
    - Whatever. It's fine.      

391
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,748
           - Okay.              
           - Okay.              

392
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,949
           - Okay.              
           - Okay.              

393
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,950
           - Okay.              
           - Okay.              

394
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,152
           - Okay.              
        - Okay, fine.           

395
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,688
    - Just get outta here,      
take that stupid hat with you.  
           - Okay.              

396
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,893
     This hat may give me       
       whatever I need,         

397
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,163
but it turns out what I really  
       need is my hat.          

398
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,039
Looks like it needs             
you, too, pal.
