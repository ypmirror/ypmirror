  The ring of invincibility     
        shall be mine!          

16
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,112
            This wasn't exactly 
               part of my plan. 

17
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,581
Your plan?                      
What do you mean,               
your plan?                      

18
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,183
            Well...             

19
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,686
                 There's a Fall 
                   Flower Fling 

20
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,756
              atop the Alkaloid 
             Trapazoid Station. 
                    Pass it on! 

21
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,192
    There's a tall shower thing 
      in Vince and Lilly's shop 

22
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,794
       on the android planetoid 
                for Dalmatians. 

23
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,563
                  Pass it on.   

24
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,832
   ( indistinct whispering )    

25
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,772
There's an all-powerful         
Ring of Invincibility           

26
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:50,576
at the top of the Blastroid     
Asteroid Formation?!            
Set a course.                   

27
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,711
                With that ring, 
        I shall be unstoppable! 

28
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,313
            Perfect.            

29
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,615
Wait. I'm confused.             

30
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,118
How did you even know           
there was a ring of             
invincibility here?             

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,154
      - I put it there.         
    - What? Where did you       
        find a... a...          

32
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,822
            Well...             

33
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,626
       Ahem. Excuse me,         
          kind sir.             

34
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:11,763
  Which of these candy rings    
    is the most romantic?       

35
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:15,667
Okay, so you planted            
an "ultimate weapon of power,"  

36
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,669
and then you told               
everyone in the galaxy          
about it,                       

37
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,805
and you didn't expect           
every villain in the galaxy     

38
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,440
to come and claim it?           

39
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,308
       Uh-uh. I was just hoping 
       for Hater and Dominator. 

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,110
   But why?                     

41
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,179
     If Hater's gonna ask       
  Dominator to get married,     

42
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,981
    she's gonna need a ring.    

43
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,182
             What?!             

44
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,717
         ( squeals )            
           Well...              

45
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,055
     ( cackling laughter )      

46
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,791
         That's right.          

47
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,460
      Dominator's greater.      

48
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,028
        Best villain.           
          Ooh, aah.             

49
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,664
        That's right,           
          ooh, yeah.            

50
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,666
      Oh, one of these,         
        one of these.           

51
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,768
      And one, two, three.      

52
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,672
             Lady?!             

53
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,119
You've really gotta start       
filling me in on these plans.   

54
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,055
   Hater's always talking about 
     how he wants a girlfriend. 

55
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,690
                   So I devised 
               a perfect set-up 

56
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,126
                   to get Hater 
                  and Dominator 
               to show up here. 

57
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,727
           They'll fall in love,

58
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,229
      that love will cancel out 
                all their evil, 

59
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,964
            and everything will 
              be great forever. 

60
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,499
Or they become                  
twice as evil,                  

61
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,634
and conquer                     
the galaxy together!            

62
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,038
       Nah!                     

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,540
               Keep at it, sir. 
            This is our chance. 

64
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,809
        If we get to            
 that ring of invincibility,    

65
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,244
     then we can trounce        
        these chumps,           

66
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,679
            and finally reclaim 
                the title of... 

67
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:37,583
      BOTH: The greatest        
        in the galaxy!          

68
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,585
    <i> - Let's get awesome. </i>      
          - Please.             

69
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,557
            Ha! Huh?            

70
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,059
       <i> Let's get awesome.</i>      

71
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,228

   greatest in the galaxy,      

72

73
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,172
     Oh, no. We gotta get       
      Hater to the top.         

74
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,374
     Dominator's not even       
          here yet.             

75
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,443
     Good.                      

76
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,378
I don't think I can             
protect you out there.          

77
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,247
                Sylvia, Sylvia, 
                        Sylvia. 

78
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,749
                  They say love 
              is a battlefield. 

79
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,185
      This is an actual         
         battlefield!           

80
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,620
         ( explosion )          

81
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,555
       Look, I get it.          
  You wanna help everybody,     

82
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,924
   no matter how many times     
   they try to destroy us.      

83
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,425
     It's like your thing.      

84
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,161
         But all this           
       is beyond nuts.          

85
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,433
            Wander!             

86
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,435
 Quit hitting yourself.         

87
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,305
Quit hitting yourself.          
Quit hitting yourself.          

88
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,240
Why are you hitting yourself?   
Quit hitting yourself.          

89
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,943
   - Quit hitting yourself.     
        - Hey, Hatey!           

90
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,946
       I'm gonna go get         
  that ring of invincibility    

91
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:45,217
and use it to make everybody in 
   the galaxy best friends.     

92
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,752
     Betcha can't catch me!     

93
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,787
            Wander!!            

94
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,956
         Please, sir,           
       we're so close.          

95
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,892
          - Don't...            
     - ( ferocious roar )       

96
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,396
        ...stop doing           
      what you're doing.        

97
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,797
          Go, sir! Go!          

98
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,799
             ( yelling )        

99
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,769
Don't worry, buddy.             
I'm coming.                     

100
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,837
        Not this time,          
           Zbornak.             

101
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,307
    You don't understand.       
      The ring's a fake.        

102
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,378
        Enough tricks.          
        It's go time.           

103
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,116
Darn it, we don't               
have time for...                

104
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,618
Oh, who am I kidding?           

105
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,920
     I've been so looking       
       forward to this.         

106
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,362
           WANDER:              
     Best meet-cute ever!       

107
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,972
              Hey, hey, it's me.

108
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,442
       I did it, so I'm         
   gonna get this ring now,     

109

     and I'm the greatest       
         or whatever.           

110
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,845
                          Wait! 
                   Who are you? 

111
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,847
         Oh, oh, um...

    something the so-and-so.    

114
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,556
 I'm really strong.             

115
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,057
And I'm gonna                   
use this ring                   

116
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,060
       to... take over          
      the solar system,         

117
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,696
 or blow it up or...            

118
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,665

00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,135
Shoot,                          
I don't know.                   

121
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,003
I really should've              
put more thought into this.     

122
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,972
        But it's late...        

123
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,574
      I have this cape,         
          so, uh...             

124
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,676
   Dude, put down the ring      
        and come back           

125
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,877
         when you're

126
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,679
          Yeah, yeah.

129
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,251
      Just put this back.       

130
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,053
    Yeah, sorry.                

131
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,788
     Uh... bye.                 

132
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,092
         Get back here.

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,910
         Kraagghthrrr.

189
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:11,209

00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,867
She came!                       
Whoo-hoo!                       

221
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,670
           Finally,             
   Operation Romance is go!     

222
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,408
         Ooh, hoo-hoo!          

223
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,343
            Oh, man.            

224
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,778
       I can't believe          
       all these idiots         

225
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,446
     are in the same place.     

226
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,382
       This'll be like          
 shooting dorks in a barrel.    

227
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,451
      But what'll I use         
         to stop 'em?           

228
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,487
     It's gotta be perfect.     

229
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,391
        Blood scythe?           
         Hammer hand?           

230
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,093
     Ooh, giant spinning        
        buzz saw arms?          

231
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,361
     A zillion tiny spikes      

232
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,463
   that shoot out a zillion     
      tiny poison darts         

233
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,098
    that make your tongue       
   swell up and you're all,     

234
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,567
          "Gah, no!             
  Betrayed by my own tongue!    

235
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,703
    Curse you, Dominator,       
        curse you..."           

236
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,204
       ( choking sounds )       

237
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,773
          ( gasps )             
             Oh!                

238
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,775
        Magma cannons.          
           Classic.             

239
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,643
              Yes.              

240
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,912
       ( evil laughter )        

241
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,814
      Okay, calm down, D.       

242
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,415
       Focus. Game face.        

243
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,451
           Game face.           

244
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,286
  It's... ( gravelly voice )    
           go time!             

245
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,157
    ( diabolical laughter )     

246
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,419
  Oh, no. If the Black Cube     
gets the ring of invincibility, 

247
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,355
   - he'll be unstoppable.      
      - ( all gasping )

              what have I done? 

258
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,837
             You're too wounded 
                        to woo. 

259
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,440
           Too harmed to charm, 
         too pooped to propose. 

260
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,410
                Come on, buddy. 
        Just one more platform, 

261
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:43,448
           and I promise you'll 
         get what you want most 
               in the universe. 

262
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,153
          Hey, Hater, I'm gonna 
    tell everyone in the galaxy 

263
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,322
   how we're best friends.      
   Don't you wanna stop me?     

264
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,558
                 Let's go. Whoo!

265
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,496
        Oh, it's no use.        

266
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,733
I guess Dominator'll just take  
  the ring of invincibility,    

267
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,068
          and become            
 the greatest in the galaxy.    

268
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,304
          Dominator?            
       I hate that guy!         

269
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,278
         This is it.            
     It's all happening.        

270
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,546
       Oh, boy, they're         
    gonna love each other.      

271
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,582
        Lord Dominator.         

272
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,651
          Lord Hater.           

273
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,457
       Oh, no, they're          
    gonna kill each other!      

274
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,527
         Stop, stop.            
     New plan, new plan.        

275
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,468
      ( wicked laughter )       

276
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,605
     Get away from there.       
   I call dibs on the ring.     

277
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,212
( panting )                     
Had enough...

00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,748
( wheezing )                    
Zbornak?                        

279
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,651
      I'm just gettin' started, 
                you optic nerd.

            - Huh?              

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,399
   Must stop their fighting.    

282
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:13,471
      Must give toast at        
  30th wedding anniversary.     

283
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,740
        BOTH: Oh, no!           
 Dominator's gonna kill him.    

284
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,409
      Five-minute break?        
      Five-minute break.        

285
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:24,015
     <i> ♪ Commander Peepers</i>       
        <i> and Sylvia ♪</i>           

286
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,289
       Stop it. There's         
   got to be a better way.      

287
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,624
         You two have           
      so much in common.        

288
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,326
   You both want to control     
         the galaxy.            

289
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,661
        You both want           
    to destroy each other.      

290
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,996
     You both like skulls.      

291
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,301
Let's use that as a foundation  
    and build from there.       

292
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,370
        I was totally           
     holding back before,       

293
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,873
    but now you shall know      
        the full fury           

294
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:53,544
        of Lord... ow!          
      That super burn-y!        

295
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,516
        Stop... being...        

296
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,451
             so...              

297
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,719
            ...cool!            

298
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,888
        Okay, new plan.         

299
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,357
       If romance won't         
    come to the mountain,       

300
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,627
      then the mountain         
    must become romantic.       

301
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,730
    ( bad French accent )       
   Such a beautiful couple      

302
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,766
           deserves             
    ze beautiful flowers.       

303
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,772
    ( bad Italian accent )      
    Or a romantic dinner.       

304
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,223
         Okay, maybe            
   we're being too forward.     

305
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,159
    How about a low-stakes      
         coffee date?           

306
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,764
         ( screaming )          

307
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,566
        The cinnamon,           
          it burns!             

308
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,573
       How can he stare         
   longingly into your eyes     

309
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,975
         if he can't            
        see your face?          

310
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,679
              Yes!              

311
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,848
     Nothing will keep me       
       from that ring,          

312
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,917
     for I am Lord Hater...     

313
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,690
    Wander. Oh, thank Grop      
         you're okay.           

314
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,625
I thought something             
terrible happened.              

315
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,727
             Something terrible 
                    did happen. 

316
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,296
                This is less of 
                    a meet-cute 

317
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,431
                    and more of 
              a meet ( growls ) 

318
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,200
                  "I'm going to 
                  destroy you!" 

319
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,202
         Your heart's           
  in the right place, buddy,    

320
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,970
    but if we don't bolt,       
       the rest of you          

321
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,972
    is gonna be splattered      
    all over the mountain.      

322
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,475
  But if Hater and Dominator    
     don't fall in love,        

323
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,577
  they'll never get married     
        and invest in           

324
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,946
    a mid-size time share       
         on Zyzzx!!!!           

325
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,216
           - What?              
    - That's what I said.       

326
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,618
       ( evil laughter )        

327
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,054
        I am Lord Hater!        

328
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:48,726
       The greatest in          
         the galaxy!            

329
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,167
        - ( screams )           
   - Let's get outta here!      

330
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,802
         No. This has           
         got to work.           

331
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,670
       I have a series          
       of ice breakers.         

332
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,506
    "What's your favorite       
         time of day?           

333
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,941
   What embarrassing thing      
 have you never told anybody?   

334
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,145
What's your favorite            
type of chocolate?"             

335
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,213
       ( evil laughter )        

336
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,894
        ( all gasping )         

337
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,372
     ( maniacal laughter )      

338
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,946
     Kneel. Kneel before        
          Dominator.            

339
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,714
         The greatest           
        in the galaxy.          

340
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,517
      No, but they were         
        supposed to...          

341
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,020
       and now they...          
        And now she...          

342
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,088
     And... it didn't work?     

343
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,059
      I really thought,         
    with love in his life,      

344
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,895
  Hater would finally learn     
  there's no point in being     

345
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,464
              so angry and evil 
                  all the time. 

346
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,033
       I'm sorry, buddy.        

347
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,869
    Love is a battlefield,      
   and sometimes, you lose.     

348
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,071
VILLAINS: Dominator's greater.  
        Best villain!           

349
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,073
     Dominator's greater.       
        Best villain!           

350
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,109
     ( chanting continues )     

351
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,414
           Haaaaate!            

352
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,735
        ( all gasping )         

353
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,941
             Lady?              

354
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,348
          ( giggling )          

355
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,352
           I... you.            

356
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,686
             Lady.              

357
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,922
         I... so cool.          

358
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,624
   Pretty.                      

359
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,959
Not hate. Like.                 

360
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,837
       ( evil laughter )        

361
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,543
        Mmm. Blorpberry.        

362
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,145
          ( slurping )          

363
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,818
 Sir? Sir? Sir?                 

364
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,088
Well, at least I think          
he likes her.                   

365
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,990
We kinda                        
sorta won.                      

366
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,660
Whoo-hoo!                       

367
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,430
            Pretty.             

368
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,165
             Lady.              

369
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,134
             Soft.              

370
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,636
          Smells nice.          

371
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,837
            Lovely.             

372
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,006
           Not hate.            

373
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,775
            Pretty.             

374
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,344
           ( laughs )           

375
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:54,845
      Sir?                      

376
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,148
This is gonna be                
a whole thing, isn't it?        

377
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,850
              ( goofy laughter )

378
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,424
            Pretty.
