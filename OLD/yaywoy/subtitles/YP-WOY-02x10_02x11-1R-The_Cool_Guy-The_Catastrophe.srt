Some people                     
are just born dorks.            

114
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,390
         He'll be back.         

115
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,493
I bet he's bored with Awesome   
  and his phony popularity.     

116
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,063
     He'll probably call        
       any second now.          

117
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,370
        Yep, any second.        

118
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,946
   This is the most fun ever!   

119
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,357
        How can he be           
      so irresponsible?         

120
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,425
      He's out partying         
       with that doofus         

121
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,894
     when we have a major       
      invasion tomorrow.        

122
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,330
        What could be           
  more important than that?     

123
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,610
We put our faces on it!         

124
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:22,013
 ( cell phone rings )           

125
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,255
        Come on, answer.        

126
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,057
         Where are you?         

127
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,259
      The fun has to be         
      drying up by now.         

128
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,961
             Right?             

129
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,578
Who is the universe's           
awesomest evil-doer?            

130
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,247
          ALL: Hater!           

131
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,349
             Yeah!              

132
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,052
        ( sighs sadly )         

133
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,587
       What's the point?        

134
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,156
           It's done.           

135
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,625
          He's gone,            
          moved on,             

136
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,960
      kicked old Peepers        
         to the curb.           

137
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,030
    Probably doesn't even       
      remember I exist.         

138
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,635
      But you know what?        
          I'm glad.             

139
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,270
       Lord Hater never         
      really cared about        

140
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,071
   conquering the universe      
     in the first place.        

141
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,007
        He just wanted          
        to be popular.          

142
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,177
   Well, that is fine by me.    

143
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,312
      I can handle this         
          by myself,            

144
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,448
      'cause some of us         
       still care about         

145
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,084

       Well, that's fine.

      use their brains.         

193
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:54,092
    I set goals for myself,     

194
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,596
      and then, through         
   education and hard work,     

195
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,364
      I figure out ways         
       to achieve them.         

196
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,233
Yes, but your goals             
are evil.                       

197
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,769

199
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,274
 Ha! One day, you'll wake up    
         and realize            

200
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,875
        all you've got

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,313
       you're a failure!

          I'm sorry.            
  You really made me think.

206
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,227
           Literally.

208
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,436
I really do hope                
you have that insurance.        

209
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,205
       ( ferocious yell )       

210
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,307

               please spare me.

214

00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,480
   It's supposed to be one      
 of the most beautiful sights   

224
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,782
         in the galaxy.         

225
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,383
        Okay, up early.         

226
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,652
      Just gotta make it        
   a couple of blocks to...     

227
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,288
      ...here. Oh, what         
       could go wrong?          

228
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,360
          Oh, right.            
           Wander!              

229
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,797
             Gasp!              

230
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,333
                  Yeah, that is 
               a real nice hunk 
               of plastic junk. 

231
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,502
           But if you wanna see 
             the real Statue of 
             the Galactic Guru, 

232
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,271
           we should probably...

233
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,475
          Bigger gasp!          

234
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,511
     You know, the actual       
     jellyfish migration        

235
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,880
                might be more...

236
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,383
     Biggest gasp possible!     

237
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,219
             Sigh.              

238
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,223
         ( exclaiming )         

239
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,359
      ( Wander screaming )      

240
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,396
Can we please not stop          
for every little thing?         

241
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,232
We're gonna be late-er          
than we already are.            

242
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,371
                 Wander. Wander!

243
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,773
           Wander, what are you 
                    looking at? 

244
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:25,276
            Kitties.            

245
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,582
        Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia. 
                   I want this. 

246
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,517
Since when are you              
into souvenirs?                 

247
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,352
      This is different.        
          I need it.            

248
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,954
                 Please, Sylvia.

249
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,021
        Please, please, please, 
        please, please, please, 

250
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:42,360
         pleeeeeaaaase?         

251
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,963
This little thingamahoozit      
is great.                       

252
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,698
 Oh, my gosh, Sylvia, look.     

253
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,767
Kitty went into                 
a sock and got stuck.           

254
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,438
   Yeah, that's nice, pal,      
     but I don't do cute.       

255
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
          - Come on.            
          - Sylvia.             

256
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,375
       Kitty is wearing         
        little boots.           

257
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,044
      Sylvia, now it has        
milk all over its 'ittle face.  

258
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,580
      Sylvia, the kitty         
       is dancing now!          

259
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,649
  Oh, babycakes, you really     
  are the most amazing kitty    

260
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,018
         in the galaxy.         

261
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,354
       Tell me, what is         
          so amazing            

262
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,922
       about cats being         
        bad at stuff?           

263
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:15,326
     - ( wacky laughter )       
          - Wander?             

264
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,463
Huh. Hey, look at that.         

265
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,965
    Whoa, I think that guy      
         needs help.            

266
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,434
    Huh. Wow, thanks, kitty.    

267
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,504
    We'll be at the Statue      
     of the Galactic Guru       

268
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,807
          in no time.           

269
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,842
     - ( horns honking )        
        - Wander, no!           

270
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,014
SYLVIA: Hey, we're not supposed 
     to be walking here.        

271
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,094
            Wander.             

272
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,796

             Ooh!               

276
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,393
      Who's in the box?         
      Youse in the box.         

277
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,437
          No! Wander!

281
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,018
         Oh, babycakes,         

282
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,488
       the predicaments         
     you get yourself in.       

283
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,162
   SYLVIA: We're gonna miss     
         the sunset.            

284
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,731
        Hold on, Wander!        

285
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,779
     Whoa! Hold on there,       
           Scabby.              

286
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,591
             Wander, you missed 
               the whole thing.

              Man, what is with

290

    Oh, no, I'd know those

313
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,117
     Making these videos        
       is so insulting          

314
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,952
      to my intelligence.       

315
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,691
    It will all be worth it     

316
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,693
       when the gawaxy          
     is under my contwol.       

317
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,762
      No one can resist         
         my cuteness.

      Well, if it isn't         
      Wander and Sylvia.        

323
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:26,044
            This is working out 
    even better than I planned.

        seems strange

00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,050

327
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,785
    What's the angle, Bits?     

328
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:37,188
    I saw an opportunity,       
        and I took it.          

329
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,023
  This is way more profitable.  

330
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,592
      And now, on top of        
        all my wiches,          

331
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,728
  and gawaxy-wide domination,   

332
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,130
       I can also have          
my wevenge on the two of you.   

333
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,067
We won't let you get away with  
   this, will we, Wander...     

334
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,902
              Oh!               

335
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,104

345
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,965
          ( purring )           

346
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,733
              Aww!

348

          listen up.            

349
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,782
   I know you think this is     
the cutest kitty in the galaxy, 

350
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,684
       but she's really         
      a greedy swindler         

351
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,786
    controlling all of you      
      with these videos         

352
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,821
    - for her own profit.       
       - ( all booing )         

353
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,624
          I mean it.            
   You have to fight back.      

354
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,259
        Look away from          
         the screens.           

355
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,228
    She's brainwashing you      
         with her...            

356
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,805
          ( laughing )          

357
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,174
     ( laughter continues )     

358
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,750
   - Sylvia, are you okay?      
         - I'm fine.            

359
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,887
   Wander, whatever you do,     
 keep those cameras rolling.    

360
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,263
             Awww!              

361
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,707
          ( laughing )          

362
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,147
              Aww!              

363
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,057
          ( laughter )          

364
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:24,288
( all chanting ) Sylvia, Sylvia,
   Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia!      

365
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,226
           Sylvia, you saved us.

366
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,760
              I don't know from 
                  exactly what, 

367
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,229
            but you did it.     

368
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,264
It was nothing, really.         

369
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,832
Don't even... ow...             
mention it.                     

370
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,839
     I'll get my wevenge        
  on you, Wander and Sylvia.    

371
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,809
       You haven't seen         
       the wast of me.          

372
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,783
Do the one where                
you fell down!                  

373
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,889
       Sylvia, Sylvia,          
       Sylvia, Sylvia.          

374
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:02,226
     ( chanting continues )     

375
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:05,763
   Hey, look at this video      
of a turtle eating a pancake.   

376
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,868
   Turtle, turtle, turtle,      
      turtle, turtle...         

377
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,041
I guess I missed the jellyfish  
migration, didn't I?            

378
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,277
I really wanted                 
to see that.                    

379
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,013
              Maybe not.        

380
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:31,822
   It's even more beautiful     
 than I thought it would be.    

381
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,791
 Let's post a selfie!           

382
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,161
  No, no more flab-drassin'     
       useless gizmos--         

383
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,896
    Imaginary memory selfie!    

384
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,464
    ( makes clicking sound )    

385
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,938
 SYLVIA: Oh, that's a keeper,   
          all right.            

386
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,545
         AUDIENCE: Ooh!         

387
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,181
             Aaaah!             

388
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,451
             Oooh!              

389
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,220
             Aaah!
