ALL THAT TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK?  

218
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,465

MY NICKNAME.                    

219
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,400

     TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK!      

231
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,008

     NAH, THAT AIN'T NO BOOM.   

233
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,512
     YOU AIN'T SEEN NO BOOM.    

234
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,514
     FIRST, HER EYES GO RED.    

235
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,784
   THEN, HER COMB STANDS UP     
       ALL POINTY-LIKE.         

236
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,153
        THEN THE VEINS          
     POP OUT OF HER NECK,       

237
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,089
        AND SHE STARTS          
     FOAMIN' AT THE MOUTH!      

238
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,860
        THEN JUST WHEN          
       SHE'S HAD ENOUGH,        

239
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:59,898
       BOOM, THAT'S WHEN        
THE TIME BOMB REALLY GOES OFF!  

240
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,736

SHE LOSES.

SOOTHE YOUR SOUL.               

248
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,945
( imitating sax music )         

249
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,887
        OH, THANKS, PAL.        

250
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,622
         SURPRISINGLY,          
     THAT ACTUALLY HELPED.      

251
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,791
 WHOOP, PARDON ME, MA'AM.       

252
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,898

    I DO APOLOGIZE, MA'AM.      

254
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,472
  I BELIEVE I WAS COMPLETELY    
       WITHIN MY RIGHTS,        

255
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,541
  ALTHOUGH, IF I OVERSTEPPED    
          MY BOUNDS--           

256
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,009
                   I'LL OVERSTEP
                   YOUR BOUNDS! 

257
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,853
( stammering )

         COMPETITION.           

260
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,861
      THAT'S MY PROBLEM.        
        IT CHANGES ME.          

261
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,529
      IT TURNS ME INTO...       

262
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,669
    THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME     
        THE TIME BOMB.          

263
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,704
     THAT'S WHY I'VE NEVER      
         WON THE RACE.          

264
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,873
      I SHOULD JUST QUIT        
   BEFORE I REALLY EXPLODE.     

265
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,509
                    NO, YOU CAN 
               DO THIS, SYLVIA.

268
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,882
        IF YOU'RE STRONG ENOUGH 
              TO OVERCOME THAT, 

269
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,651
           THEN YOU'VE GOTTA BE 
               STRONG ENOUGH TO 
           OVERCOME YOUR ANGER,

             AND WIN THIS THING.

271
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,589
  NO, I'M BEYOND HELP.          

272
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,825
      YOU MIGHT BE BEYOND HELP, 
                 BUT WE'RE NOT. 

273
