<p><strong> -----------------------------------</strong></p>
<p><strong>What's up with the filename format?</strong></p>
<p>We have two main different format for video, TVRip and iTunes, iTunes video is better as it doesnt have watermark and is a real native 1080P encode, it however may take time to be available, and it doesnt has the end animatics.</p>
<p>You can recognize if you have an iTunes or a TVRip episode by reading the filename, if you have an iTunes one, you should see &quot;1R&quot; after the number of the episode(s), if however, you have a TVRip, you gonna see &quot;1TV&quot;. 1R mean 1080P Raw and 1TV mean 1080P TVRip</p>
<p>You can read our filename like that : YP : YayPonies - WOY : Wander Over Yonder - **x** : Episode number - 1R/1TV : Quality - Episode_name - External source credit (ex : TVRip.Spazz)</p>
<p><strong>The episode number is false / has changed since publication : </strong></p>
<p>Due to the random airing order, there no way to be sure about the episode numbers, since that they can be unreliable, that why we included episode name in the filename for Wander Over Yonder, since torrents, we can't easily rename those files, you can however change the episode number by yourself !</p>
<p><strong>The metadata of the iTunes files only cover the first episode in the dual episodes file : </strong></p>
<p>Because our UNDRM process wasnt designed for multiple episode in one, we're unable to add the second episode metadata into the MKV in a way that would worth it.</p>

<p><strong> Who we are ?</strong>
<p>YayPonies is a second initiative as an attempt to getting the episodes of <strong>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</strong> out there in various formats after PonyArchive takedown.</p>
<p>Our episodes of <strong>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</strong> is hosted on a server somewhere in Equestria. <br /><strong>WE ARE NOT THE SAME STAFF THAN PONYARCHIVE ONE, ITS USELESS TO CONTACT THEM ABOUT US !</strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong> What software or player should I use?</strong>
<p> We recommand <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"> VLC Media Player</a> or <a href="http://www.cccp-project.net/">the CCCP Codec Pack with Media Player Classic</a> for all versions of Windows. On Linux you can use mplayer or smplayer (check your package manager). On Mac OS X, you can use<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mplayerx/id421131143?mt=12&affId=403761"> MplayerX </a> (AppStore link).

<p><strong> I have read somewhere that Tor is for hidden websites that are involved in terrorism, child abuse and kitten murder. Why is Yay Ponies mirrored there?</strong>
<p> Tor is a neutral network, everyone is anonymous, to protect freedom of expression, regardless of the nature of the content. We know that these kinds of site exist on the Tor network, and even though we are strongly against the terrible act of murdering kitten, the answer is that we simply don't visit them. We invite you to do the same, and visit only good sites, like those that provide you with ponies. :p (We like kitten. And ponies! :) .
<br>
<p><strong> Can I help you with the hard task of sharing ponies?</strong>
<p> Firstly, always seed anything after you download it! Next, you can help out by giving us a server to run a copy of this website on, and add to the front page index. We have a light version of the site ready for even the most low-end servers, if required.  If you have a source, you can provide us with episodes or subtitles. We especially welcome subtitles in languages other than English ! 
<br>
<p><strong>Can I donate money to Yay Ponies?</strong>
<p>Donations won't be accepted. We don't really need money, and these ponies are not OUR hard work, but Hasbro's and DHX Media's. If you can, please support the show! 
<br>
<p><strong> There a way to get faster direct download with hosting companies ? exept than being premium ?</strong> </p>
<p> It look like you can download from filecloud at a good speed if you create a free account and if you copy files on your account before downloading them.
</p>
<p><strong> I have another question, or I want to contact you...</strong> </p>
<p> If you still have any other questions, you can connect to the PonyChat irc server (irc.ponychat.net) and join #ponyarchive. You can also join #yayponies if you're interested in giving us help. Finally, you can contact us by <a href="mailto:contact@yayponies.eu">mail</a>.
