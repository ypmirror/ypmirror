       Only the best for

Oh, my goodness!                

27
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,002
Thank you so much,              
B-Fly.                          

28
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:12,004
I mean, a princess              
such as myself                  

29
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,740
could never indulge in          
such confections.               

30
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,575
      But would you please      
          donate them           

31
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,178
   to the starving Bartindles   
   of Galafamor on my behalf?   

32
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,915
          Did you bump          
      your uni-horn again?      

33
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,117
Girl, you know we can't         
receive packages here at        

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,885
St. Olga's School               
For Wayward Princesses.         

35
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,822
                   ( shrieks )  
                   Get out, get 
                   out, get out!

36
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,991
             B-Fly?             

37
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:36,895
              I can't even stand
              to hear the name  
              of that place.    

38
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,898
         ( shuddering )         

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,734
Oh, please, you gots            
to be chill, B-Fly.             

40
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,636
I'm the one doing               
hard time here.                 

41
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,772
       I know, but if you       
         weren't there,         

42
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,941
        we could totally        
          party it up.          

43
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,742
         Rainbow tea at         
       the Dowager Room,        

44
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,745
    sliding down the twisty     
   slopes of Zalla Mountain,    

45
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:58,183
  then dancing all night long   
     at the Bounce Lounge.      

46
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,952
      Oh, heck yeah, girl.      

47
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:03,388
     That would be the best     
    birthday day ever! Boom!    

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,390
    - ( metallic creaking )     
           - Oh, no.            

49
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:08,760
  I expressed my individuality  
and publicly showed an emotion. 

50
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,796
  And that's my third strike.   

51
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,698
      Oh, no, no, please.       
            No, no!             

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,167
     They're sending me to      
the solitary conforment chamber.

53
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,169
           Pony Head!           

54
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,339
         Oh, you don't          
         deserve this!          

55
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,174
             Ready to take out  
             life's frustrations

56
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,910
         on some ill-intentioned
                 monsters?      

57
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:28,347
( loud sobbing )                
This is terrible!               

58
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,716
     Best friends don't let     
          best besties          

59
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,251
            have bad            
         birthday days.         

60
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:34,786
        ( blows loudly )        

61
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,055
    And Pony Head is having     
      the worst one ever.       

62
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,791
           Pony Head?           
     Yeah, I'm outta here.      

63
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,793
   Marco, we have to get her    
      out of that prison.       

64
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,663
        Oh, a breakout.         

65
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,965
          Why didn't you say so?

66
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,901
    - Wait, isn't St. O's--     
         - ( shrieks )          

67
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,769
         St. O., St. O., St. O.!

68
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,071
      Uh, we haven't even       
           left yet.            

69
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,174
             Sorry.             

70
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,342
          What's that           
        under your rug?         

71
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,012
        I have no idea.         
        But I do know one thing.

72
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,748
    Never, ever step on it.     

73
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,349
Let's get back to               
that breakout thing.            

74
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,718
             But no one's ever  
             escaped from there.

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,387
I've seen every                 
prison escape movie made.       

76
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,055
   We only need three things.   

77
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:14,359
       Patience, brains,        
      and the ever-famous,      

78
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,862
         multi-faceted          
           bobby pin.           

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,698
    Or we use my dimensional    
         scissors to go         

80
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,267
straight to her cell and get her
     the heck outta there.      

81
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,472
Uh, this isn't                  
Pony Head's cell.               

82
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:31,076
              Huh. I'm usually  
              pretty accurate   
              with these things.

83
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,112
     - ( horses whinnying )     
        - ( exclaiming )        

84
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,855
            Ah, yes, the newbies
            have arrived.       

85
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:47,759
     Welcome to St. Olga's      
 School For Wayward Princesses. 

86
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,795
      ( thunder crashing )      

87
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,397
        - ( screaming )         
        - New arrivals?         

88
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,967
               If we could just 
               blend in somehow,

89
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,902
               we could sneak in
               unnoticed.       

90
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,370
              All we need is a--

91
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,106
         Radiant shadow         
           transport!           

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,481
                    Whoa! Do me.
                    Do me.      

93
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,216
Radiant shadow                  
transport!                      

94
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,153
        You couldn't turn me    
        into one of those guards

95
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,822
            with the cool masks?

96
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:17,956
I don't know.                   

97
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,858
Pink is definitely              
your color.

       <i> a one-of-a-million</i>

    <i> emotionless rubber stamp</i>

         <i> can count on.</i>         

116
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,435
        Every one of you        
     is here for a reason.      

117
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,373
                 Too wild.      

118
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,075
        Too opinionated.        

119
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,480
                     Too bubbly.

120
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,315
           As part of a noble   
                lineage,        

121
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,352
   you don't have the luxury    
    of being an individual.     

122
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,921
         So by the time         
       I'm done with you,       

123
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,889
      you'll all be fixed.      

124
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,191
     Every last one of you,     

125
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,526
         whether you're         
         from Pixtopia,         

126
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,428
           or Mewni.            

127
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,998
And don't even think            
about escaping.                 

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,934
       These are useless.       

129
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:12,003
 We have a Tramorfidian Crystal 
          in Tower 3.           

130
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,874
   No rift can sustain itself   
       within our walls.        

131
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,244
 So you might as well cough up  
 the scissors you smuggled in.  

132
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,546
        ( all groaning )        

133
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,382
          It's totally hopeless.

134
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,450
Once we get Pony Head           
and disable that crystal thing, 

135
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,352
      those are our ticket      
          outta here.           

136
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,889
         That concludes         
       your orientation.        

137
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,159
       I'm confident that       
       you'll all become        

138
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,194
             perfect princesses.

139
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,030
      One way or another.       

140
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,333
      Now to get everyone       
           checked in           

141
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:45,036
    so we can start sucking     
 the individuality out of you.  

142
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,573
( high-pitched voice )          
I hear the first one            
checked in                      

143
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,909
gets her own room.              

144
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,978
       ( all exclaiming )       

145
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,379
Respect the queue.              

146
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,515
   Respect the queue!           

147
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,955
       - This place isn't       
       what I thought--         
       - Sh!                    

148
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,994
              Yeah, breaking out
              Pony Head         

149
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,996
           is gonna be a breeze.

150
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,932
 It's just a high-surveillance  
    prissy finishing school.    

151
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,102
No, Marco, it's worse

    You know, this place has    
 some seriously luxurious digs.

of the canopy bed.              

167
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,722
And there's enough velvet       
on that bedspread               
for me to swim in.

     - Dancing?

00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,371
          No. We gotta do this

173
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,106

             Hey, it's us,      
         here to break you out, 

179
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,255
            so we can party.    

180
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,094
             - Ah!              
    - My deepest apologies,     

181
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,328
      but I must abstain,       

182
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,398
       as partying is for       
         the unrefined.         

183
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,067
       That's not the Pony Head 
           I know and love.     

184
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,736
I got this.                     

185
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,238
Hey, Pointy Head.               
It's Earth Turd.                

186
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,709
    Such language belongs in    
   the gutters of Galafamor.    

187
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,313
You know, I kinda               
like her better this way.       

188
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,181
    Snap out of it,             
       Pony Head.               

189
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,716
  Snap out of it!               

190
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,452
              ( laughs )        
              Would you care    
              for some crumpets?

191
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,188
    See, Marco, this is what    
      they do to you here.      

192
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,692
Relax. Once we disable          
that crystal thing              
and get her outta here,         

193
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,194
she'll finally be               
a benefit to society.           

194
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,698
      What are you doing?       

195
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
           I saw this           
       in a prison movie.       

196
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,435

         <i> Jail Mountain.</i>        

197
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,270
       Trust me, this'll        
        save our hides,         

198
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,273
       just like it saved       
         Hank Innocent.         

199
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,478
                It's clear.     

200
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,747
          Oh, escaping          
       is inappropriate.        

201
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,282
Guards.                         
Guards!                         

202
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,818
                Guards!         
                Yoo-hoo, guards.

203
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,120
Hey, stop!                      

204
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:52,424
       Keep your pinkies        
         at 90 degrees.         

205
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,726
       More tea, please.        

206
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,262
       Keep your pinkies        
         at 90 degrees.         

207
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,565
       More tea, please.        
    Keep your pinkies at...     

208
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,602
       This is worse than       
      my worst nightmare.       

209
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,438
          Yeah. I see           
         what you mean.         

210
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,574
               Keep your pinkies
               at 90 degrees.   

211
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,109
             Why are you        
             saying that?       

212
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,178
             You don't even     
             have pinkies.      

213
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,281
           - Come on.           
    - ( chanting continues )    

214
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,217
       More tea, please.        

215
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,120
               He's right on us.

216
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,522
Are we gonna                    
blast our way                   
out of this?                    

217
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,858
            No. That'll only    
        increase the heat on us.

218
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,694
               We need some kind
               of distraction.  

219
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,230
Well, they are not              
getting my individuality.       

220
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,531
                      That's it.

221
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:37,769
       It's not criminal        
      to be an individual.      

222
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,606
            Come on.            
       It's not criminal        

223
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,475
      to be an individual.      

224
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,544
       It's not criminal        
      to be an individual.      

225
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:50,482
     ALL: It's not criminal     
      to be an individual.      

226
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,251
               That should      
               buy us some time.

227
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,252
     ( chanting continues )     

228
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,222
        Tee-hee. He got scolded.

229
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,157
          She's laughing at     
         an authority figure.   

230
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,259
           I think the real     
     Pony Head's still in there.

231
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,629
          An uprising?          

232
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,699
       In my institution?       

233
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,201
        Put St. O.'s on         
         full lockdown          

234
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,338
   and find the free thinker    
      who initiated this.       

235
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,508
  We will quell this uprising   
        in its infancy.         

236
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,611
         Quell, quell.          

237
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,312
         Is that right?         

238
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,947
Someone get                     
a thesaurus.                    

239
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,454
              Wrong way.        

240
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,593
                Quick. Find     
                a place to hide.

241
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,731
         There she is.          
            Get her.            

242
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,268
              Oh!               

243
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,606
         We've stifled          
         the uprising.          

244
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,376
        Soon we'll find         
       those responsible        

245
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:55,246
       and stifle them in       
 a solitary conforment chamber. 

246
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,848
             Here's our latest  
               success story.   

247
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,351
        The once-wayward        
       Princess Pony Head       

248
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,921
    is now a model student,     
            reborn.             

249
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:06,691
Yes. I'm glad                   
we stifled the uprising.        

250
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,295
You know, stifled               
isn't working for me either.    

251
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,497
Prepare the chamber.            

252
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,632
I'm leading this                
princess hunt myself.           

253
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,274
   MARCO: What is this place?   

254
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,843
      STAR: I don't know.       

255
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,445
        ( dogs barking )        

256
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,314
   We gotta move.               

257
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,388
      There. I'll see you       
         at the bottom.         

258
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,024
         My poufy dress         
           won't fit.           

259
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,994
            Marco!!             

260
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,329
        Something's got         
         my stockings.          

261
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,964
         ( screaming )          

262
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,468
         ( screaming )          

263
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,772
          ( laughing )          

264
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,944
        Marco. You gotta        
       help me save him.        

265
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,546
         I can't do this alone. 

266
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,019
   A princess who misbehaves    
         will be saved          

267
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,322
        in the solitary         
      conforment chamber.       

268
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,292
     Why can't you remember     
          who you are?          

269
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,394
         ( door slams )         

270
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,870
         Really? What?          

271
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,948
         <i> The proper hat</i>        
         <i> for the event</i>         

272
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,351
          <i> lest you be</i>          
         <i> a malcontent.</i>         

273
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,420
      <i> Everyone will admire</i>     

274
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,957
        <i> the princess who</i>       
       <i> does not perspire.</i>      

275
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,593
    <i> 'Tis better to be fussy</i>    

276
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,062
       <i> than to be called</i>       
            <i> a hussy.</i>           

277
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,098
        Ugh. I can smell        
        her free spirit         

278
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,502
   through the safety glass.    
          Full power.           

279
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,507
         So this is how it ends.

280
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,509
       On a cold checkered floor

281
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,477
     by a pile of soiled linens,

282
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,580
           wearing an eye patch.

283
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:12,483
      "Embrace a princess       
           mentality.           

284
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:16,855
           Wash away            
      your individuality"?      

285
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,725
                   Embrace this!

286
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,802
                     ( sobbing )

287
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,145
( laughing )                    

288
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,783
Yeah. That feels                
so good! Whoo!                  

289
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,558
           Pony Head?           
          You're back!          

290
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,394
Oh, you know it.                
Now let's go destroy            
something else.                 

291
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,496
I don't even care               
what it is.                     

292
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,031
             ( Marco screaming )

293
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,634
Ooh, hold it.                   
I'd recognize that              
girly scream anywhere.          

294
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:05,036
       That's Earth Turd.       

295
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,071
     Yep. Heinous got him.      

296
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,407
       Well, what are we        
          waiting for?          

297
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,043
   Isn't he your best bestie?   
            - Yeah.             

298
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,780
      On Earth. I'm still       
your best bestie overall, right?

299
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,416
           - Come on.           
     - ( Marco screaming )      

300
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,518
Open that vent.                 

301
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,690
     Keep screamin', Marco.     

302
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:29,761
     Proper throne posture.     
          ( screams )           

303
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,932
   Yes. We are extinguishing    
    that rebellious spirit.     

304
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,870
                   Make it stop!

305
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,205
                   ( screaming )

306
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,775
I'm blasting our way            
outta here, Marco.              
You cool with that?             

307
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,810
       Where did she get        
           that wand?           

308
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,812
                    ( screams ) 

309
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,580
Gotcha, Marco.                  

310
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,116
         Now let's get          
      the heck outta here.      

311
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,152
           Are they gonna let me
           keep the dress?      

312
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,454
               Shoo. Shoo, shoo,
               shoo, shoo.      

313
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,756
           - Go away!           
         - Your cheeks.         

314
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,558
     No. Stop it, stop it.      

315
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,627
        You saw nothing.        

316
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,698
       A princess always        
      maintains her poise.      

317
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,535
I'm glad you're                 
back to normal, by the way.     

318
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,570
                 Aw, you too.   

319
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,972
             Now I can make fun 
             of your ugly dress.

320
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:17,675
       It's not criminal        
      to be an individual.      

321
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,179
     ALL: It's not criminal     
      to be an individual.      

322
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,948
        Man, I can't believe it,
        but you sure worked     

323
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,550
                 some turd magic
                 on these girls.

324
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,118
                 They are in it.

325
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,486
Yeah, you really                
started something.              

326
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,254
          My work here          
          is not done.          

327
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:34,625
   My fellow wayward sisters,   
     I'll show you the way.     

328
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,195
      They want you to be       
    a rubber-stamp princess.    

329
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,931
    I saw we stamp on them!     

330
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,500
          ( yelling )           

331
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,608
       There's the tower.       

332
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,991
     Raspberry Panzerfaust!     

333
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,597
        Looks like that         
          did the job.          

334
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,605
        Let's get outta here.   
                Whoa.           

335
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,174
             Whoa!              

336
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,546
               Time's a-wastin'.

337
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,615
      If we hurry, we can       
 still catch DJ Jump-Jump's set 

338
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,217
    - at the Bounce Lounge.     
 - Girl, I ain't goin' nowhere. 

339
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,020
  The Bounce Lounge ain't got   
     nothin' on this party.     

340
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,889
  But it's your birthday day.   

341
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,024
          You gave me           
      the best gift ever,       

342
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,092
        and it's called,        

343
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,261
           getting me           
        my groove back.         

344
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,762
          Look at me.           
        It's back, babe.        

345
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,564
          BOTH: Hugs.           

346
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,071
         So you wanna stay here?

347
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,739
          Oh, I gotta.          

348
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,340
        I can't let what        
         happened to me         

349
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,743
     happen to anyone else.     
    Right, Princess Turdina?    

350
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,779
   Get on with your bad self,   
       my wayward sister.       

351
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,215
    Yeah! I'm gonna go bite     
   some of those robot guards   

352
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,851
       - on their faces.        
       - Bite one for me.       

353
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,719
    Okay, Marco, I conquered    
        my biggest fear,        

354
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,254
      I grew as a person,       
        yada yada yada.         

355
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,224
      Let's get outta here      
      and never come back.      

356
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,593
         If your elbows         
       are on the table,        

357
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,763
           you belong           
          in a stable.          

358
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,665
             There.             

359
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,067
          All better.           

360
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,798
              Hmm.              

361
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,667
          I will find           
       the rabble rousers       

362
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,238
      responsible for this      
      and annihilate them!      

363
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,773
          Annihilate.           

364
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,776
        That's the verb         
     I've been looking for.
