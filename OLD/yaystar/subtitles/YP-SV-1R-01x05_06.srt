00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,256
                Whoa.

Jeremy Birnbaum's butt!

00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,874
           Jeremy Birnbaum?

00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,209
     Isn't that the talking bear

33
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,211
   that used to rummage through 
           my parents' garbage?

00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,913
He's just this creep            
in my dojo                      

35
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,714
who's only any good             
because his rich parents        

36
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,284
buy him fancy equipment         
and private lessons.            

37
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,652
         But Saturday,          

38
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,254
        he's gonna get          
       a taste of this.         

39
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,589
           Hi-yah...            

40
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,358

      This is a nightmare.      

43
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,164
    If I can't fight Jeremy,    

44
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,632
     he'll say I wussed out     

45
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,734
    and he'll never let me      
        live it down.

00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,103

          Pigtails?             
          Ponytail?             

48
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:46,939
         Wait a minute.         

49
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,140
        You have a wand!        

50
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,642
        You could just          
         fix my hand.           

51
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,112
          You know,             
      that sort of spell        

52
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,947
         is not really          
         in my comfort zone.    

53
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:54,947
      Oh, but if you like,      

54
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:59,852
   I can give you a pretty      
   wicked set of pigtails.      

55
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,955
                  Pigtails?

58
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,659
        Unless,                 

59
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,995
       I could look up          
     a bone-healing spell       

60
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,797
 in the magic instruction book  

61
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,132
that came                       
with the wand.                  

62
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,800
    What?! This whole time,     

63
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,268
       you had a magic          
      instruction book?         

64
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,004
Yep, whenever a previous        
owner of the wand               

65
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:22,174
mastered a spell, they scribbled
it down in here.                

66
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,810
     But it's a complete        
      disorganized mess.        

67
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,146
      It's gonna take me        
      forever to find--         

68
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,180
        Oh! Here it is.         

69
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,181
            Really?             

70
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,315
 Hmm.                           

71
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,152
It's in an ancient              
language.

00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:37,990

74
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,193
     I can feel it working!

    My fingers are tingling!

 Don't worry.                   

79
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,002
There must be a spell in here   

80
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,170
 that can change it back.       

81
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,271
I can fix it.

   Morning, monster arm.        

89
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,905
      I was up all night        

90
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,941
 but I haven't found a way      
 to reverse the spell.

meal of the day?                

94
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,387

         Uh...

109
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,822
                       Uh, sure.

110
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:17,889
       I want it to be          
        my boyfriend.           

111
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,057
                Me too!         

112
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,125

116
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,334
                      A reverse 
                tentacle spell. 

117
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,435
                      I think.  

118
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,337
Uh, maybe you                   
should practice                 

119
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,505
on something first.

Uh, I'm going to bed now.       

124
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,221
                    Don't worry.

125
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,290
                    I'll get it.

126
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,860
                     Returnius, 
           Armius, Normalrinny! 

127
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,864
                         Ugh.   

128
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,438
                STAR: Returnio, 
            Armius, Normalrino! 

129
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,344
                 ( gasps )      

130
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,214
                    Marco!      

131
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,352
                  673,          

132
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:23,188
               674, 675.        

133
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,258
I did it, I did it, I did it,   
I did it, I did it!             

134
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,060
                   Hey, I think 
               this monster arm 

135
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,262
    might actually help me      
       take out Jeremy.         

136
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,364
      Hi-yah!                   

137
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,267
   Wait.                        
   You're gonna fight           
   with <i> that?</i>                  

138
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,369
      That sounds               
      kind of unfair.           

139
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:40,272
      Oh, funny how you         
     never have a problem       

140
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,240
       using your magic         
       when it benefits <i> you,</i>   

141
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,309
        but as soon as it       
        gives <i> me </i> an advantage,

142
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,877
      you wanna take it away.   

143
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,513
Marco, I think that arm's       
a bad influence on you.         

144
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,382
             And I think        
             you should go.     

145
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,983
What?                           

146
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,251
Fine, but I don't--             

147
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,252
     ( door slams )             

148
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,322
                      Huh. Man, 
            what does she know? 

149
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,627
Don't listen to her,            
she's just jealous.             

150
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,496
             What? You can talk?

151
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,431
    You don't need              
    her anymore.                

152
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,968
I can give you everything       
you ever dreamed of.            

153
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,436
          - Really?             
           - First,             

154
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,239
we're gonna destroy             
that little punk Jeremy.        

155
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,640
               Yeah.            

156
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,509
     Then we're gonna get       
      Jackie Lynn Thomas        

157
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,511
        - to like you.          
           - Yeah!              

158
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,880
     And then we're gonna       
     slaughter all humans       

159
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,049
  and feast on their bowels!!!  

160
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,350
                Yeah!!!         

161
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,485
            Wait. What?         

162
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,653
I mean, uh,                     
win the tournament!             

163
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,355
               Yeah!            

164
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,325
       STAR: Excuse me.         
     MAN: Ooh, watch it.        

165
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,359
         STAR: Sorry.           
        GIRL: Hey! Ow!          

166
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,162
     Sorry, sorry...sorry.      

167
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,097
Are you okay,                   
Star?                           

168
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,565
  You look <i> terrible.</i>           

169
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,634
 And I have                     
 very low standards.            

170
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,637
           I've been up         
           for two nights,      

171
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,173
          trying to fix         
          his monster arm,      

172
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,975
          then he gets mad.     

173
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,309
            And then I got      
            to come here        

174
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,279
         and watch him karate,  
         you know?              

175
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,315
Allow me to introduce           
our first competitor,           

176
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,317
 Jeremy Birnbaum!               

177
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,585
       ( music playing )        

178
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,387
              Hi-yah!           

179
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,122
                  That's Jeremy?

180
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,258
FERGUSON: That kid can't be any 
more than eight years old.      

181
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
  Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!      

182
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,928
  We love you, son.             

183
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,363
           Shut it, Mom!        

184
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,531
          And his opponent,     

185
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,966
                     Marco Diaz.

186
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,535
       ( audience gasps )       

187
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,104
                     Now that's 
                  an appendage. 

188
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,472
                      Hey, wait!

189
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,340
   He's got a monster arm!      
       That's not fair!         

190
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,176
Yeah! Pretty cool,              
right?                          

191
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,080
            Hey-oh!             

192
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,316
            Whoa!!!             

193
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,252
     ( groans )                 

194
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,654
                Point, Diaz.    

195
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:39,257
         Where are your private 
           lessons now, Jeremy? 

196
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,725
                     Huh?       

197
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,061
           ( laughs )           

198
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,196
              He's beaten.      

199
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,565
      - Now, finish him.        
           - What?              

200
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,567
         This is what           
         you've always wanted.  

201
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,968
              Destroy him.      

202
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,369
           Eat his bowels.      

203
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,038
 Not my bowels!                 

204
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,439
I love my bowels!               

205
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,209
     Hey, listen, I just wanted 
          to win the tournament 

206
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,377
                 so he wouldn't 
                make fun of me. 

207
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,446
             If you're too weak 
                 to finish him. 

208
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,315
                     I'll do it 
                        myself. 

209
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,616
          ( screams )           

210
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,085
       Star was right about you.

211
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,121
   You <i> are </i> a bad influence!   

212
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,524
                        And you 
                  are pathetic. 

213
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,626
         Whoa!!!                

214
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,096
               Point, Diaz.     

215
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,100
            Star?               
        You can change          
         it back now.           

216
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,736
          BOTH: Star!           

217
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,004
         ( both gasp )          

218
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,108
  Star,                         
  you gotta wake up!            

219
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,176
         (crying) Star!         

220
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,281
       Star!!!                  

221
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,482
          Stop hitting yourself.

222
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,351
          Stop hitting yourself.

223
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,186
         Hey, wake up!          

224
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,287
Here,                           
try this.                       

225
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,322
     Oh, thank you so much.     

226
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,790
No,                             
on Star.                        

227
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,158
           Oh, right.           

228
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,296
          MARCO: Star!          

229
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,036
Returnio, Armius, Normalrino!   

230
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,508
              Returnio, Armius, 
                    Normalrino! 

231
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,650
                     Hai.       

232
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,824
             Whoa!              

233
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,097
       ARM (laughing):          
       I could do this          
           all day.             

234
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,233
       Ahh! He's too wiggly!    

235
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,738
           ( grunts )           

236
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,213
                       Now!     

237
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,584
Returnio, Armius, Normalrino!   

238
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,319
  You'll never get rid of me!   

239
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,254
      I'm part of you now.      

240
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,689
 You can treat the symptoms     

241
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,658
but you'll never cure           
the virus...                    

242
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,529
                       Ugh.     

243
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:01,099
      Marco, are you okay?      

244
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,601
                 ( gasps )      

245
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,202
                  My arm!       

246
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,503
          My beautiful arm.     

247
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,873
          It's back to normal.  

248
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,209
          ( grunts )            
     And totally broken.        

249
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,210
      JEREMY: Broken arm?       

250
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,747
                      Ha! Well, 
           it looks like I win. 

251
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,822
                Brass knuckles? 
                     Seriously? 

252
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,858
                     Brass?     

253
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,293
                   They're gold.

254
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,495
You boys have brought           
shame and dishonor              

255
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,297
to this great                   
and noble sport.                

256
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,431
 'Tis a sad day                 

257
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,134
for strip mall dojos            
everywhere.                     

258
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,638
                      ( grunts )

259
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,341
            Oh, bravo, son.     

260
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:43,341
                 Bravo.         

261
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:47,445
   Argh. I wish I could         
   fight <i> you, </i> Mom.            

262
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,181
                    What a turd.

263
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,317
 Ahh. Sorry.                    

264
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,252
I should've listened            
to you, Star.                   

265
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,754
               I know.          

266
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,356
Hey, uh, when the monster arm   
said he'd be back,              

267
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,425
that's nothing                  
to worry about, right?          

268
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,795
              Uh...probably not?

269
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,240
           ( yawns )            

270
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,775
         ALL: Surprise!         

271
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:20,478
        Happy 47th day          
       on Earth, Star.          

272
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,647
     Aaah! A party? For me?     

273
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,749
     I can't believe it!        
          You can't?            

274
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,785
We've done this every day       
since you got here.             

275
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:27,786
               Here, Star.      

276
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,487
              I made you a cake.

277
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,756
                    And I wrote 
                    you a poem. 

278
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:35,226
        Our lives were so small 
                      and puny, 

279
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,629
till this angel arrived from... 
      ( doorbell rings)         

280
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,631
Ah, thank goodness.             

281
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,666
             Hello!             

282
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,968
        It is I, Gustav.        

283
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,904
                   No way!      

284
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:49,708
Ho-ho! Marco,                   
my American friend.             

285
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,518
                Look who's here!

286
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,888
       - How wonderful.         
 - What a wonderful surprise!   

287
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,357
               We've missed you 
                       so much. 

288
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,692
            Um, hi.             

289
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,294
       Oh, hello.               

290
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,729
      I am Gustav.              

291
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,399
I was Diaz's exchange           
student last year.              

292
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,701
            What? But I thought 
        I was your one and only 

293
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,002
       foreign exchange student.

294
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,571
Not even close.                 

295
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,540
I mean, who did you think       
all these kids were?            

296
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,742
       Hmm.                     

297
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,977
       I brought gifts          
      from Scandinavia.         

298
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,011
          For Mrs. D,           

299
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,347
        a pair of clogs.        

300
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,349
 For Marco, the handheld game,  

301
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,384
       Lederhosen Tycoon.       

302
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,853
       And for Mr. Diaz,        

303
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,422
    a genuine Viking helmet.    

304
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,490
   ( gasps )                    

305
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,527
And for you,                    
nothing.                        

306
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,029
I did not know                  
you existed.                    

307
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,364
                   Oh.          

308
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,500
          Oh, Mrs. D,           

309
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,001
        you've gotten           
           so thin.             

310
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,970
       I need to fatten         
           you up.              

311
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,638
     Gustav.                    

312
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,708
Come, everyone, and I will cook 
      you my meatballs.         

313
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,576
       MARCO: Oh, Gustav.       

314
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,482
The Scandinavian monsoons       
were over,                      

315
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,652
        but the danger          
       had just begun.          

316
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,987
    The iceberg was sinking.    

317
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,822
   Heedless of my own peril,    

318
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,357
          I disrobed.           

319
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,392
 I dove into the freezing fjord 

320
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,562
      and I carried Yuri        
     back to his mother.        

321
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,431
           ( gasps )            

322
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,800
              Ooh.              

323
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,001
           Oh.                  

324
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,303
          Whoa.                 

325
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,738
             Meh.               

326
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,839
       Marco, think fast.       

327
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,311
So, uh, Gustav,                 

328
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,046
where exactly                   
are you from?                   

329
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,049
     How much do you know       
        about Europe?           

330
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,717
 I know it's a place.           

331
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,085
 I'm pretty sure.               

332
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,321
                  Oh, well then,

333
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,424
        I come from the country 
                of Scandinavia. 

334
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,626
     It is a land where Vikings 
                teach gym class 

335
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,762
                   and everyone 
             has a pet penguin, 

336
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,096
                    even if you 
           don't like penguins. 

337
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,798
                  Oop, too bad, 
           here's your penguin. 

338
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,066
            MARCO:              
    Hey, Gustav, I'm open.      

339
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,368
          Meatball me!          

340
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,337
           Ooh, Now me, Gustav. 

341
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,505
                   Now me!      

342
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,574
                  ( laughs )    

343
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,845
         Are you sure           
      those are cooked?         

344
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,081
              ( laughs )        

345
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,116
                      Over here!

346
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,651
          Just think,           

347
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,753
 three more weeks of this!      

348
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,893
           ( yawns )            

349
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,394
         ALL: Surprise!         

350
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,363
     Aah! A party for me--      

351
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,399
ALL: Happy second day           
of your visit, Gustav.          

352
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,134
 Oh, Diaz family.               

353
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,637
You are so full                 
of pleasantness.                

354
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,673
       ( all chanting )         
Gustav, Gustav, Gustav, Gustav! 

355
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,741
                    ( laughing )

356
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,644
         Huh?                   

357
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,681
          What?                 

358
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,085
               Oh, look at you. 
           Such a curious girl. 

359
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,486
       Now, eat your cake       

360
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,422
  and mind your own business.   

361
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,157
      Okay.                     

362
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,059
         More cake for everyone!

363
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,494
 Marco, listen.                 

364
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,897
I think there's something       
off about Gustav.               

365
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,066
I found Scandinavian books      
and language tapes in his bag.  

366
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,069
Why would someone need          
to learn his own language?      

367
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,404
                       Uh...    

368
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,171
Why is he always                
making meatballs?               

369
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,573
 Meatballs aren't so great.     

370
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,041
 I can make things too.         

371
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,979
               Uh, jealous much?

372
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:15,980
      GUSTAV: Hey, Marco!       

373
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,082
Think fast!                     

374
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,451
       I hope he <i> never </i> leaves!

375
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,886
        ( Mom laughing )        

376
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,121
            Oh, no, thank you.  

377
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,123
             Oh! That's         
             a very big bite.   

378
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,791
              Ugh.              

379
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,897
       ( phone ringing )        

380
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,146
             Huh?               
             Huh?               

381
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,849
( snoring )                     

382
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,561
       Oh, Star.                

383
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,229
       We're about to--         
            Whaa!               

384
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,167
     ( breathing heavily )      

385
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,005
                What's going on?

386
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,073
    I've been awake for days    

387
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,541
       spying on Gustav,        

388
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,476
      and I'm this close        
       to figuring out          

389
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,178
      what he's plotting.       

390
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,145
                      What?!    

391
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,147
His stories don't add up, Marco.

392
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,483
Penguins, icebergs, polar bears.

393
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,652
What the heck                   
is a polar bear?                

394
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,988
       And he's making          
     phone calls, Marco.        

395
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,155
          Phone calls!          

396
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,791
     He's up to something       
          terrible!             

397
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,229
        You have lost your mind.

398
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,497
But if you find it,             

399
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,165
we're meeting Gustav            
for a picnic                    

400
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,834

can hear you scream...

with enjoyment.

So, you admit you're planning   
to eat the Diazes?              

443
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,209
           Yes, yes.            

444
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,177
          Wait, what?           

445
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,279
               No, I don't want 
                   to eat them. 

446
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,780
         But you said--         

447
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,250
                I mean, I'm not 
              from Scandinavia. 

448
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,019
               Truth is my name 
              is Charlie Booth, 

449
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:18,689
             and I'm just a guy 
         from Bakersfieldville. 

450
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,391
         Nobody's heard of it.

      GUSTAV: Back home,        
 I'm just another boring face   

453
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,132
  in a <i> really </i> boring crowd.   

454
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,201
          It's not a good place 
    for a talented guy like me. 

455
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,203
But what about                  
the phone calls?                

456
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,739
And the axe?                    
And those meatballs?            

457
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,208
    Well, the phone calls       
     were to my meat guy,       

458
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,876
    but he wouldn't pick up.    

459
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,144
   MAN: <i> I'm the meat guy,</i>      
      <i> Leave a message.</i>         

460
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,145
              Bro, it's me.     

461
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,015
        Come on, man,           
       I need the meat.         

462
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:48,019
 The axe was to cut firewood    
      for today's feast.        

463
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,189
    As for the meatballs,       
 my dream is to become a chef   

464
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,324
    and open a restaurant       
     in Bakersfieldville        

465
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:57,028
that uses spices and flavors.   
          All: Yay!             

466
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,097
   So that's why I ran away     
and moved in with the Diazes.   

467
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,201
But what about measuring        
the Diazes in their sleep?      

468
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,204
                     Uh...      

469
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,272
         ( horn honks )         

470
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,142

  What a pleasant surprise!     

471
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,710
                    You made it!

472
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,212
                Yeah, I did.    

473
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,281
    And I came here to tell you 
        something about Gustav. 

474
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,449
   ( gasps )                    

475
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,850
    ( laughs )                  

476
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,725
                  He's made you 
         even <i> more </i> meatballs! 

477
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,227
            - Yes!              
         - Fantastic!           

478
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,195
         Oh, meatballs.         

479
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,030
Phew.                           

480
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,799
Thanks for not blowing          
my cover, Star.                 

481
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,902
If there's ever anything        
I can do for you...             

482
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,439
     Well, as a matter of fact, 
             Charlie, there is. 

483
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,807
              Bye!              

484
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,242
        Bye-bye, Gustav!        

485
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,276
              Bye!              

486
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,444
             ALL: Bye-bye!      

487
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,445
     ( indistinct chatter )     

488
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,080
      Gonna miss you, bud.      

489
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,748
MAN: Hey, get off the road!     

490
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,950
See you next year,              
Gustav!                         

491
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,452
                        Or not, 
                you never know. 

492
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,287
                        Bye now.

493
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,456

494
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:02,560
 Happy 51st day on Earth, Star. 

495
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,263
Ah! A party for me?             

496
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,465
                 Who wants cake?

497
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,101
        I'm sorry your favorite 
               exchange student 

498
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,269
           had to leave so soon.

499
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,270
   You kidding?                 

500
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,271
You're my favorite.             

501
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,338
                        Aww.    

502
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,207
I will miss                     
seeing him, though.             

503
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:19,944
