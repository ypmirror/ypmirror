1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,980
Starlight Glimmer?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,760
I was sure I saw her, Spike.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,640
Welcome home, Twilight!

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,680
We travelled back in time to
when Rainbow Dash performed

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,200
her first Sonic Rainboom?

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,780
Without the Rainboom,
you and your friends

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,900
will never form your
special cutie mark bond.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,480
But whatever Starlight did in
the past changed things here.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,360
I don't want to live in
that awful future we saw.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,960
I don't think
you'll have to.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,520
All servants of Queen
Chrysalis found in these woods

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,120
must be destroyed!

13
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,212
Hearing impaired subtitles

We have muffins!

14
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,320
Wait! We're not changelings!
I'm a pony! And he's a dragon!

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,920
A likely story!

16
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,320
Do something dragonish!

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,920
That works.

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,480
The servants of Chrysalis
will do anything

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,320
to save their evil skins!

20
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,900
STOP!

21
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,640
If they are
changelings,

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,060
we'll soon see.

23
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,660
Though I think they're not
what they appear to be.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,020
Zecora! Please,
you have to listen.

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,500
Beneath this salve
no changeling hides,

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,340
for it reveals the
truth inside.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,680
What does it mean?

28
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,480
The meaning is far worse, I see.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,680
For it is we who should not be.

30
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,720
I think I can explain.

31
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,280
I'm sure you can, but
let's not talk here.

32
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,600
Chrysalis and her army
will soon draw near.

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,700
The changelings took
over not long ago,

34
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,920
though I'll wager in
your world that isn't so.

35
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,140
Chrysalis and her army tried
to take over Canterlot,

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,020
but my friends
and I stopped her.

37
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,260
Those friends as you know
them are not here, alas.

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,860
But tell me how all
this came to pass.

39
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,420
Starlight Glimmer. A pony
who traveled back in time

40
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,160
to stop my friends and me
from ever coming together.

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,380
And it is these friends
you have in life,

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,900
that keep Equestria
free from strife?

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,960
I guess so. But this is the
second time I've come back

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,120
and this world is even
worse than the last one.

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,040
If Starlight keeps doing
the same thing in the past,

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,180
how could the present
be so different?

47
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:12,858
Ahhh, time is a river where even
the tiniest changes seen...

48
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,120
Can lead to a cascade
of effects downstream.

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,500
This part of the forest
is dark and damp,

50
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,900
but it's done well
to hide our camp.

51
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,580
This is cozy.

52
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,360
Please, you have to help us!

53
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,480
The changelings
attacked Ponyville.

54
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,540
We barely escaped
with our lives!

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,020
The only changeling
attack I see

56
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,460
is the one that come
here looking for me.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,960
It's taken quite a while
to find you, Zecora.

58
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,740
What a lovely
village you've chosen

59
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,660
to stage your little resistance.

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,400
It looks absolutely
delicious!

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,700
Oh, come now, Zecora,
you're vastly outnumbered.

62
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,770
I know you don't want
your charges hurt.

63
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,710
Come quietly to the
dungeons of Canterlot

64
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,680
and I promise to leave
the others alone.

65
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Why would she ever trust you!

66
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,520
Even if there's a chance
Chrysalis will honor her word,

67
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,640
shouldn't you try?

68
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,920
Race to the map while we
hold off their attack.

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,540
Stop Starlight and put the
whole world back on track.

70
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,200
Time to make a decision, Zecora.

71
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,100
Even if what you are
saying were true,

72
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,140
we'd never surrender
to a creature like you.

73
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,900
Not bad. But it's going to
take a lot more than that!

74
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,880
Lucky for you, there's
more where that came from!

75
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,640
You've really got
to work on your aim!

76
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,340
WHOA!

77
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,700
What are you doing? You
have to finish your race!

78
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,020
No way! This is
way more exciting.

79
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,380
See? You can't stop me
no matter what you do.

80
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,460
Aw, man!

81
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,690
That's strange.

82
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,120
Well, you obviously
don't mean us failing,

83
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,340
because that's becoming
pretty routine.

84
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,740
No. It's just the other
times we've come back,

85
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,600
it's been day, but look.

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,000
Why would the map
would bring us back

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,980
to a different time of
day than when we left?

88
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,540
Um, maybe we should
figure it out later.

89
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,940
The Castle of the Two Sisters!

90
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, don't just stand here!

91
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,160
This place looks a lot
cleaner than I remember.

92
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,540
Rarity?

93
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
The castle isn't open
for viewings today.

94
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,040
The tapestries all need
changing... again.

95
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,900
Rarity, it's me.

96
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,630
I don't socialize with dragons.
I don't know anypony who would.

97
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,380
Rarity, you have
to listen to me.

98
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,340
The future of
Equestria is at stake.

99
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
I don't know how
you know my name,

100
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,700
but I am far too busy to
entertain some tourist's

101
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,080
ridiculous fantasies.

102
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,950
I have to get back to the
map so I can stop Starlight

103
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,880
from changing the past because
every present I come to

104
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,220
is worse than the last!

105
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,600
Time travel, you say?

106
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,530
Now that's something
I would like to see.

107
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,480
Tell me how you came by this
magic to travel through time.

108
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,700
The Princess asked
you a question!

109
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,320
And unless you want to
end up in the dungeon,

110
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,400
you'll tell her what
she wants to know.

111
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,580
No pony in my kingdom but
me should possess a magic

112
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,900
powerful enough to change time.

113
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Your kingdom?

114
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,280
Who else?

115
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,180
Um, Celestia, of course.

116
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,160
My sister has been imprisoned
in the moon for years!

117
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,440
But it is no less a fate
than she sentenced me to.

118
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,500
Now. Reveal to me the
source of this time magic.

119
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,100
All right.

120
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,540
Twilight! No!

121
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,200
We have no choice, Spike.

122
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,480
I can take you to it,

123
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,840
but you'll have to get
past the Timber Wolves.

124
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,020
I am the ruler of
all of Equestria.

125
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,620
Do you think I can't
deal with Timber Wolves?

126
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,680
No. I know you can.

127
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,060
And if you were thinking
of trying to escape...

128
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,880
it would be very
unfortunate for your friend.

129
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,560
How does it work?

130
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,800
A pony from my time used a spell

131
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,840
to travel back and
change the past.

132
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,420
And now you will give
this spell to me.

133
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,020
With it, I will ensure that
the Elements of Harmony

134
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,500
are never found and
my rein lasts forever!

135
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,700
But it won't.

136
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,920
What?

137
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,260
In my world, my friends
and I found the elements

138
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,980
and used them to defeat you.

139
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,960
And I will do
everything in my power

140
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,720
to bring that world back.

141
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,780
NO!

142
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,140
NOOOOOOO!

143
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,120
Now more than ever, I know how
important it is to stop you.

144
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,760
Well, good luck!

145
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,480
Whoa!

146
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,600
Up for another race-ending
fight, Twilight?

147
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,380
No. You were right.
I can't stop you.

148
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,200
But you can't stop
me from trying

149
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,060
and we could be stuck doing
this for all eternity.

150
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,960
If that's what it takes to
keep you and your friends

151
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,340
from getting your cutie mark
connection, then I'm game.

152
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,960
What you're doing goes
way beyond cutie marks.

153
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,140
Everything we do
here in the past,

154
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,780
even the smallest change,

155
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,900
can snowball into an avalanche
of trouble for the future.

156
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,500
Oh. Next I suppose
you'll tell me

157
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,190
that the fate of
all of Equestria

158
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,640
hangs in the balance.

159
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,120
IT DOES!

160
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,440
Spare me your over-blown ego.

161
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,460
No group of friends, not
even Princess Twilight's,

162
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,620
is that important.

163
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,700
I don't know how important
other ponies' friendships are

164
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,400
to the future,

165
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,160
but I can show you what the
world is like without mine.

166
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,280
Where are we?

167
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,800
The future. Or
rather, the present.

168
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,120
But there's nothing here.

169
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,580
I wish I could say
I was surprised.

170
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,660
But every world I come back
to is worse than the last.

171
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,540
I don't know why my friends
and I are so important

172
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,480
to Equestria, but we are.

173
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,060
I don't believe you!

174
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,540
Come on, Starlight. Look around.

175
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,480
Like I said, everything in
the past affects the future,

176
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,400
even the tiniest act, and
what you're doing leads here.

177
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,020
I know I can't stop you,

178
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,800
but I thought showing you
this might change your mind.

179
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,680
Change my mind? You don't
know anything about me.

180
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,680
I was perfectly happy
before you and your friends

181
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,420
ruined what I built.

182
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,660
I don't know what happened
that led you to make

183
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,380
your village
without cutie marks.

184
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,300
And I'm sorry my friends
and I had to take it away.

185
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,510
You want to know what happened
to me? I'll show you!

186
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,180
Where are we?

187
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,280
That map of yours is connected
to every part of Equestria

188
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,540
and this part is my home.

189
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,940
Sunburst and I did
everything together.

190
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,180
In fact, I don't remember
us ever being apart...

191
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,060
until today.

192
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,920
And just like that,
my friend was gone.

193
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,100
His family recognized
his magical talent

194
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,480
and sent him off to Canterlot.
I never saw him again.

195
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,440
Why not?

196
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,060
Because of his cutie mark!
He got his and I didn't.

197
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,220
He moved on and I didn't.

198
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,960
I stayed here and never
made another friend

199
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,260
because I was too afraid
another cutie mark

200
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,840
would take them away too!

201
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,440
That's ridiculous.

202
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,900
A cutie mark can't
take your friends away.

203
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,700
Not everypony's lucky
enough to get her cutie mark

204
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,320
at the same time as her friends.

205
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,740
You don't know what it's
like to lose a friend

206
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,960
because of a cutie mark.

207
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,550
But once I stop the
Rainboom, you will!

208
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,500
And when I destroy this scroll,

209
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,330
there'll be no way
for you to change it!

210
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,140
Starlight, you're right.

211
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,060
I don't know what
you went through,

212
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,220
but I do know you
can't do this.

213
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,360
I've seen where this
leads and so have you.

214
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,320
I only saw what
you showed me.

215
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,000
Who knows what'll
really happen?

216
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,700
I've seen it a dozen times.

217
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,520
Things don't turn out
well in an Equestria

218
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,720
without my friends.

219
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,640
Agh! What's so special
about your friends?

220
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,580
How can a group of ponies
that are so different

221
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,460
be so important?

222
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,920
The differences between
me and my friends

223
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,520
are the very things that
make our friendship strong.

224
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,980
I thought Sunburst
and I were the same,

225
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,700
but we turned out different

226
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,980
and it tore our
friendship apart.

227
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,020
So try again. Make new friends.

228
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,260
And if something that
you can't control happens

229
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,920
that changes things, work
through it together.

230
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,600
That's what friendship is.

231
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,620
And it's not just my
friendships that are important

232
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,900
to Equestria. Everyponies' are.

233
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,280
When yours ended,
it led us here,

234
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,580
but just imagine all the
others that are out there

235
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,960
waiting for you if you
just give them a chance.

236
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,700
How do I know they won't
all end the same way?

237
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,420
I guess it's up to you
to make sure they don't.

238
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,240
One Castle of
Friendship. Check.

239
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,080
What in Equestria was that?

240
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,160
Is everypony OK?

241
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,780
Can you do it again?

242
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,960
One group of amazing
friends. Check.

243
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,060
Yeah, Spike. It looks
like we're home.

244
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,340
Uh, what's she doing here?

245
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,280
Actually, it's kind
of a long story.

246
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,660
I mean, I knew my
Rainboom was awesome,

247
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,460
but I never thought all of
Equestria depended on it.

248
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,940
Or on us!

249
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,440
I think it's more than that.

250
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,640
Friendship connects
all of Equestria

251
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,540
and undoing one group
of friends

252
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,200
made its magic
less powerful.

253
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,380
I can't believe y'all
were able to travel

254
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,660
through time like that.

255
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,180
That Starlight must
be pretty magical!

256
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,760
She obviously has
more talent for magic

257
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,620
than almost any pony I've seen.

258
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,480
My magic couldn't stop her.

259
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,840
I had to convince her
to stop on her own.

260
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,980
Once I realized that,
everything fell into place.

261
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,340
But if she's as
powerful as all that,

262
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,320
we can't just send her
on her way, can we?

263
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,840
Actually, I kind of have
something else in mind.

264
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,780
I know there's no
excuse for what I did,

265
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,800
but I want you all to
know that I'm ready

266
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,900
for whatever punishment
you think is fair.

267
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,980
I've been thinking a lot about
how badly Equestria fared

268
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,640
without just one
group of friends.

269
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,940
Because even when
one friendship dies,

270
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,740
the results can
be disastrous.

271
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,320
I know, firsthoof,
how true that can be.

272
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,440
And that's why I've
asked you here.

273
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,140
If you're willing
to learn,

274
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm willing to teach
you what I know.

275
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,346
You'll have the power
to make Equestria

276
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,520
an even better place.

277
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,960
How do I start?

278
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,520
Starting is easy. All you
have to do is make a friend.

279
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,960
And you've got seven
