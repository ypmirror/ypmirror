1
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:23,962
I'm bored!

2
00:00:24,754 --> 00:00:25,964
But you're reading.

3
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:27,966
I've read all these books already.

4
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,177
And...?

5
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:34,264
And I'm bored. I wanna do something.

6
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,140
Things have been so slow around here I don—

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,142
Twilight! Twilight!

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,938
Ooh, Twilight, darling, oh, thank goodness!

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,064
It seems that my—

10
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:47,944
Whew! Got here as fast I c—

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,575
Yes! Finally!

12
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,577
We've been summoned!
I wonder where the map wants us to—

13
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:56,869
Uh, Twilight...

14
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:44,876
Where do ya think?

15
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:55,386
Manehattan! We've been called to Manehattan!

16
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:58,306
Oh, I've simply been dying to go back for a visit!

17
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:02,101
And now, I return...with a purpose!

18
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,395
Hmmm. It looks like you've been summoned

19
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:06,564
to this particular neighborhood here.

20
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:08,649
We're off to solve a friendship problem

21
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:12,278
in one of the busiest and most vibrant cities in all of Equestria!

22
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:13,905
Isn't this exciting?!

23
00:02:15,823 --> 00:02:17,617
Seems a hair odd, though, don't it?

24
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:20,787
Map callin' me to a big city like Manehattan?

25
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:23,498
You may be more of a country pony at heart, Applejack,

26
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:26,167
but the map picked you two because you're the best ponies to

27
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,461
tackle this particular mission.

28
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:31,422
But how will we even know what our mission's supposed to be?

29
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:33,800
That neighborhood probably has twice

30
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,593
as many ponies as all of Ponyville.

31
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,970
Pff. Kch. Ts! More like three times!

32
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,515
Why, it's not only home to the Haypacking District,

33
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:43,601
it's also home to the Fashion District!

34
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:48,856
Hmm, shame you weren't called as well, though, darling.

35
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:50,525
You did end up quite a fan of the hustle

36
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,944
and bustle of Manehattan on our last visit.

37
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,113
It's such an exciting city,

38
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:57,365
and there's still so much I'd like to do there.

39
00:02:57,365 --> 00:03:00,493
So many museums and historical landmarks to visit.

40
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:03,538
Not to mention all the libraries!

41
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,665
But this is your mission.

42
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:08,418
Don't worry 'bout me.
I've got plenty of...

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,045
books...to keep me...busy.

44
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:16,384
I just remembered something!

45
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:18,761
The Sisterhooves Social!

46
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:21,764
We'll have to miss it.

47
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:24,308
No tellin' how long we'll be in Manehattan.

48
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:27,603
I sure hope Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle aren't too upset.

49
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:46,247
Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me!

50
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,964
Darling, are you all right?

51
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:59,385
Ponies move so fast here.
Not at all like back home.

52
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:04,307
Eyes peeled, ears open.
Eyes peeled, ears open.

53
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,486
Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now.

54
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:17,987
No moseying.

55
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:20,740
You gotta walk with speed and confidence!

56
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:25,745
Yoo-hoo!

57
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,875
Move it!
Sorry 'bout that.

58
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,543
Ah, git outta my way!
Sorry.

59
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:35,129
Watch it!
Heh...oh dear.

60
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:37,924
Butter my biscuits,

61
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:39,967
I can barely cross the street in this town.

62
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:42,470
How'm I supposed to help solve a—

63
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,846
There!

64
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:47,558
Yes, I think this is the one.

65
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:48,601
No! No.

66
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,186
Excuse me?

67
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:51,896
That hat clashes with your mane,

68
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,189
not to mention it's far too large

69
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:55,107
and will undoubtedly obstruct your vision.

70
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:59,779
Oh, dear, none of these will do.

71
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,533
Oh, Applejack!
Aw, good timing!

72
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:09,330
Here. This will do splendidly.

73
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,165
Oh, it's lovely!

74
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:12,917
Uh, how much would you like for it?

75
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:16,254
Oh, no no, please, please, keep it.
I can always make another.

76
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,297
Thank you!

77
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:22,051
And you thought we wouldn't discover our purpose here!

78
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:25,846
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that wasn't it.

79
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:26,681
What?

80
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:30,518
I just saved that poor pony from committing a terrible crime of fashion.

81
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:35,606
Well, she could've been meeting a friend

82
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:37,024
who would've laughed at her new hat

83
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,735
and then their friendship could've been ruined forever!

84
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,239
And...mmm...it's possible.

85
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:47,034
Did your cutie mark glow signifyin' a job well done?

86
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,620
Ye— No.

87
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,790
I suppose it didn't.
Still, a disaster was averted!

88
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,502
Averted? You just lost me a paying customer!

89
00:05:56,627 --> 00:05:59,547
Oh, my! Oh, I-I-I-I-I'm s-so sorry.

90
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,715
I never meant to—

91
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:01,799
Beat it!!

92
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:01,841
Uh, please accept my sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding,
Beat it!!

93
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:05,428
Uh, please accept my sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding,

94
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:08,639
and, might I add, what a lovely establishment you have here!

95
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:15,438
You're right, Applejack.
The search continues.

96
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:20,610
Uh, 'scuse me, I was wonderin'...

97
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,778
Uh, friendship problem, anypony?

98
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,488
See, we've been sent here to..

99
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:26,782
A-A map summoned us and, uh...

100
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:28,868
If you could just take a moment to, uh...

101
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:31,120
Friendship advice!

102
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,373
Anypony looking for friendship advice!

103
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:39,587
Good grief!
This isn't working!

104
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:42,214
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.

105
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:45,968
To be honest, I'm still not even sure what the map called me here for.

106
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:48,137
Oh, try not to worry, Applejack.

107
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:50,222
The map picked us for a reason.

108
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:53,434
Although, how we're supposed to uncover that reason, I haven't a clue.

109
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,853
We can't possibly approach every single pony

110
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:58,356
in town until we find out what we're meant to DO!!

111
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:03,235
"Please help us restore our long-lost but beloved tradition,

112
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,529
the Midsummer Theater Revival.

113
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:08,991
There's a guest performance by a local theater troupe, the Method Mares,

114
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:11,035
as well as games, food, and much, much more.

115
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:13,579
This event promises to bring our broken neighbors together

116
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:15,289
and restore our sense of community

117
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,000
but there's so much to do and we need your help." Huh.

118
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:21,045
Darling, this is it!

119
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:24,465
The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel!

120
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:26,092
Oh, right!

121
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:28,844
She's the one who got a job makin' costumes

122
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,846
for that designer friend o' yours.

123
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:34,558
Don't ou see?! This must be why the map called us here!

124
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:36,602
Oh, and you were so worried!

125
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:39,146
Well, I suppose it's at least worth lookin' into...

126
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:42,983
that is, if we ever get off this street corner.

127
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,324
I can't believe you found my flyer.

128
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,368
Quite a coincidence, don't you think?

129
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:55,538
Applejack and I were specifically summoned here to be of service,

130
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:58,916
and you, my dear friend, are in need of help.

131
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:02,294
It's no coincidence, darling.
It's fate!

132
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:05,840
This Midsummer Theatre Revival –

133
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,842
what is it, exactly?

134
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:11,178
An outdoor play held in the community park.

135
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:14,515
Many moons ago, local theatre troupes would perform,

136
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:16,142
and ponies in the neighborhood would help

137
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:18,853
make the costumes, and design setpieces,

138
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:21,647
prepare food to share during the performance.

139
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,608
Y'all do look like you're enjoyin' each others' company.

140
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,360
Kinda reminds me of Ponyville.

141
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,612
It sounds lovely, darling.

142
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:29,864
It was,

143
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:31,866
up until several moons ago.

144
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:33,576
What happened?

145
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:35,286
That's Charity Kindheart.

146
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:38,122
She was a well-known costume designer on Bridleway.

147
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:40,499
She started the Midsummer Theatre Revival

148
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,419
as a way to share her passion for theatre with the neighborhood.

149
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,049
No matter how busy she was, she always made time for the Revival.

150
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:52,136
But when she moved away to be closer to her grandfillies,

151
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:55,139
the neighborhood lost the special tradition she had started,

152
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,267
and worse, the sense of community it fostered.

153
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:03,189
Hey, I'm trotting here!

154
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:07,318
Nopony else stepped up to take over for Charity?

155
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:09,361
I've been trying to,

156
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,113
but I've just gotten a last-minute request

157
00:09:11,155 --> 00:09:13,783
to alter costumes for the cast of My Fair Filly,

158
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:16,285
and I'm afraid I haven't made much progress.

159
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,664
Oh, there's just so much to do to bring back the Midsummer Revival,

160
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:23,751
and my flyers haven't attracted a single volunteer!

161
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,211
Say no more!

162
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:27,671
You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow,

163
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:30,257
you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof.

164
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,551
Applejack and I will make sure of it!

165
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:34,011
You will?

166
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:36,013
You bet your boots we will!

167
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:38,390
Oh, I don't wear boots.

168
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,601
I find they chafe my calves when I walk.

169
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,312
It's just an expression.

170
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:50,361
So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day,

171
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:53,614
and we need all the help we can get with preparation!

172
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:56,325
Eh, not a good time right now.

173
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:59,620
What am I saying?
It's never a good time!

174
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,334
Well? What do you think?

175
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,378
I got my own problems.

176
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:10,548
You think I've got hours to dedicate to somepony else's?

177
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:13,342
Ah yes,

178
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:18,180
Charity's Midsummer Theatre Revival, such wonderful memories.

179
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,557
So you'll help us?

180
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,810
Don't be ridiculous!

181
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,939
I run a very important oat and hay import/export business.

182
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:30,359
I can't spare even a moment for such things!

183
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:38,325
This is a nightmare.

184
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,327
Oh, not at all, darling!

185
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:42,246
It's quite lovely!

186
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:45,541
I think she was talkin' about the Midsummer Theatre Revival?

187
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:48,335
I finished the alterations for My Fair Filly,

188
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,462
but I've barely started the costumes for the Revival,

189
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:52,381
and the Method Mares are coming to the park tomorrow

190
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,425
for a costume fitting and rehearsal!

191
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,802
Well, I could help you with the costumes.

192
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:59,346
But what are we going to do about the rest?

193
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:01,223
The park is in desperate need of repairs,

194
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,309
and the sets still need to be built!

195
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:06,562
Well I know a thing or two about buildin' and fixin' things.

196
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:08,939
It's kinda, well, my thing.

197
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:11,317
Could be the reason the map called me here!

198
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,027
You see, dear?

199
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,570
We went out looking for volunteers

200
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,864
when all the help you need is right here!

201
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:17,615
Uh-huh.

202
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:20,534
The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me

203
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:21,952
if it was more than we could handle!

204
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,705
Everything is going to be just fine!

205
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:28,000
Perhaps I spoke too soon...

206
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,633
Oh dear, you're right!

207
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:38,135
Are you sure you can manage this by yourself?

208
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:40,262
Well, there's a lot to do...

209
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,639
but Rarity's right.

210
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,015
The map wouldn't have called us here

211
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:44,391
if we weren't up for the challenge!

212
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:46,477
You two go on and take care of the costumes.

213
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:48,228
I'll see you at the dress rehearsal.

214
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:49,832
I know it looks bad, but I'm movin' as fast as I can.

215
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,295
Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time.

216
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,212
Everything's going to be-

217
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:56,880
Ehm, excuse me?

218
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:00,050
Is this where the Midsummer Theatre Revival

219
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,677
is supposed to be, perchance?

220
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:05,097
We're here for the dress rehearsal?

221
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:09,226
Oh, yes! We've just put the finishing touches on the costumes.

222
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,729
At least those look professional.

223
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:16,442
We'll do a dry run of the play first, and then the fitting.

224
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:22,072
No, wait! I haven't got a chance to-

225
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,624
...reinforce the stage yet.

226
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:44,762
I just wanted to live up to Charity's example,

227
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:47,139
to bring my neighborhood together again!

228
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,099
The park is still a mess,

229
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:50,726
we haven't even thought about what refreshments

230
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,186
to serve during the performance,

231
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:53,937
and even if we had, we don't have a stage

232
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:55,939
for the Method Mares to perform on!

233
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,566
It's hopeless...

234
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,568
just hopeless!

235
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:05,115
I don't understand. The map summoned us here

236
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:06,742
to solve a friendship problem,

237
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:10,412
we've clearly found it, but why did it send the two of us?

238
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:11,705
Why not Twilight?

239
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,332
I'm sure she could have used her magic

240
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:15,334
to transform this park in an instant!

241
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,086
I've been thinkin' the same thing.

242
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:20,380
I mean, I can at least see why you're here – Coco's your friend,

243
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,425
and you have a knack for costumes and all – but me?

244
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:26,345
I was never gonna be able to finish a project this big!

245
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:28,764
We'll return to Ponyville as failures!

246
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:30,516
Why must this be, Applejack?

247
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,017
Why?

248
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,268
Wh-

249
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:37,022
Now hold on there. I'm not suggestin' we pack up and go home.

250
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:40,651
And what are you suggesting-  And what are you suggesting?

251
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:44,029
I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do,

252
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:46,115
and start doing what we can!

253
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:47,908
I think I've got a plan.

254
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:50,994
It won't be anythin' big or fancy, but it'll be somethin'.

255
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:53,705
And somethin's gotta be better than nothin', right?

256
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,707
I suppose so...

257
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:58,460
That's the spirit! Sorta...

258
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:04,049
Alright y'all, it's ready!

259
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,138
Should we go ahead and start?

260
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:17,396
Excuse me? I'm Charity Kindheart,

261
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:20,274
I'm here about the open design position!

262
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,359
I brought some samples of my work.

263
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,361
I'm sorry I'm late.

264
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:26,864
I had the hardest time finding my way here!

265
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:28,866
I just moved here,

266
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:31,952
and I keep getting mixed up by the street names!

267
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:35,289
I had a map, but I dropped it in a puddle,

268
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:39,418
which only made the street names harder to read!

269
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,420
I see.

270
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:43,338
What is that?

271
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:45,799
I dunno, sugar, looks like some kinda play.

272
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,926
Well, can we stay and watch it please?

273
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:50,012
Please, can we, can we?

274
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:53,182
Oh alright, I suppose we could stay for a minute.

275
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:57,936
Excuse me, but your next appointment is here.

276
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:00,230
Alright. Send him in.

277
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:03,817
I'm sorry, but based on these samples,

278
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:07,112
I just don't think this is the place for you.

279
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:12,910
Don't get me wrong, these clothes are all exquisite,

280
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,247
and well-made, but more theatrical than avant-garde.

281
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:20,250
Have you considered costume design?

282
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,086
I have a contact on Bridleway!

283
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,504
If you're interested,

284
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:27,174
I can put you in touch with him.

285
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,676
And scene.

286
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:40,312
Charity, dear, is that you?

287
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:42,314
Hello, Mrs. Pearblossom!

288
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,441
I didn't see- oops!

289
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:47,528
Oh, let me help you, dear.

290
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,655
Are these the costumes you've been working on?

291
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:52,699
Yes, I was supposed to be finished by now,

292
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,743
but there's just so much to do,

293
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:57,454
and I still have a few last-minute alterations

294
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:59,289
to make before opening night!

295
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:01,959
I'm sorry I couldn't get enough tickets

296
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,963
for everypony in the neighborhood, I hope Mr.

297
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,298
Pearblossom wasn't too disappointed.

298
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,843
I know Trotter on the Roof is one of his favorites.

299
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:13,804
Oh, my dear filly, don't worry about that.

300
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:15,347
We're so proud of you!

301
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,765
We shall be with you in spirit!

302
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:20,602
Thank you! You've all made me feel so welcome here,

303
00:17:20,602 --> 00:17:22,980
and have become like family to me!

304
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:27,359
I just wish I could share this experience with you and the others!

305
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,944
Eh, what's goin' on?

306
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:31,154
It's the Midsummer Theatre Revival.

307
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,698
The Method Mares are performing!

308
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:38,328
The Revival. Mhm, yeah, my pop used to bring me.

309
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:42,833
So nice of you to put on this play for the neighborhood.

310
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,961
I couldn't have done it without everypony's help!

311
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,922
I know it's not Bridleway, but-

312
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:51,466
Oh, pish-tosh! It's perfect, dear!

313
00:17:57,014 --> 00:18:01,143
Oh, you're such a dear, thank you!

314
00:18:01,143 --> 00:18:02,477
This is so nice.

315
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:04,229
Haven't seen the neighborhood

316
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:07,566
this friendly since Charity moved away!

317
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:17,326
Thank you, fillies and gentlecolts.

318
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,786
Please give a warm welcome to the one

319
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:24,583
who made this entire event possible, our neighbor, Coco Pommel!

320
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:35,677
Thank you all so much for coming.

321
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:38,013
The Midsummer Theatre Revival was always

322
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:39,973
something that meant so much to me,

323
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:43,226
and it seems it means quite a lot to all of you as well.

324
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,937
I really can't take all the credit, though.

325
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:50,442
My dear friends Rarity and Applejack helped me ever so much.

326
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:56,657
Oh darling, please, it was just a few costumes.

327
00:18:56,657 --> 00:19:00,243
Aw shucks, I just happen to be good with a hammer, is all.

328
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:03,246
To be honest, we had much bigger plans to start.

329
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:06,166
When those fell through, we decided to simplify.

330
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,834
This here was the result.

331
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,252
Oh, don't be so modest.

332
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,670
Coco and I were lost.

333
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,673
You bet your boots we were!

334
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:27,896
We just wanted to say how much

335
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:30,023
we enjoyed the Midsummer Theatre Revival,

336
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:31,858
and how much it inspired us!

337
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:33,068
Oh yeah?

338
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:36,071
I used to think that to help my community

339
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:38,949
I had to do something big, aheh.

340
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:41,243
Let's face it, in this day and age,

341
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:44,454
who has the time for such a commitment?

342
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:48,291
But here, you did something as simple as

343
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,712
building a stage and putting on a play, and, heh,

344
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:54,923
look at how it's brought everypony together.

345
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:58,009
I saw Coco's flyers for volunteers but didn't think

346
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:00,762
anything I'd have time to do would be that useful.

347
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:03,849
Now I wish I'd offered to help, even if it was just

348
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,643
pulling a few weeds, or planting a few flowers.

349
00:20:06,643 --> 00:20:10,772
Not sure if you noticed, but the park is far from bein' fixed up.

350
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:12,858
I imagine if you look around you'll find there's

351
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,609
lots of little ways for you to get involved

352
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,611
in changin' this place for the better.

353
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,196
And I will!

354
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:21,575
And I don't think we'll be alone!

355
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:28,540
Yee-hoo!

356
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,500
We did it!

357
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:35,046
I understand now! It all makes perfect sense!

358
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:36,465
Huh?

359
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:41,928
I know why the map called you here!

360
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:43,221
You do?

361
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,266
If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park,

362
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:48,435
it wouldn't have fixed the real problem,

363
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:50,937
which is that these Manehattan ponies didn't think

364
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:53,482
they had time to do something for their community!

365
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:56,693
But by building that stage and making sure the play went on,

366
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:59,529
you showed them that just by doing something small,

367
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:01,656
you can make a big difference!

368
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,408
Well I'll be!

369
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:04,910
Seems you have more in common

370
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,037
with the Manehattan ponies than you thought!

371
00:21:07,204 --> 00:21:09,706
Heheh. But, all the same,

372
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:12,417
I'd sure like to head back to Ponyville on the next train.

373
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,294
I want to check in with Apple Bloom and find out

374
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:16,213
how the Sisterhooves Social turned out.

375
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:18,173
Oh, absolutely, my dear.

376
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:21,676
Just as soon as I stop that pony in the shop over there

377
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:24,012
from purchasing that dreadfully hideous scarf!

378
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:25,013
Stop!

379
00:21:25,013 --> 00:21:27,516
You're making a terrible mistake!
