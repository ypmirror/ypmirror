00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,410
<i>Spike is great
Making a jewel cake</i>

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,150
Me, that's who.

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>Been saving up my gems
So fine</i>

4
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,700
<i>For a cake
That is divine</i>

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,300
Who are you "hooing" at?

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,930
I know. They're delicious.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,010
Now you see them,
now you don't.

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,530
<i>This is how you make
A jewel cake</i>

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,890
<i>Stir in some gems
And then you bake</i>

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,010
<i>Gonna eat, eat, eat it up
Gonna--</i>

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,690
What happened
to all my jewels?!

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,550
I had a bowl full of them here
and now I don't!

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,270
Which means,
somebody took them!

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,100
Who? That's what I'm asking.
Who?

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,070
Who took my jewels?!

16
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,580
Oh, I'm who.

17
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,030
This cake was gonna be
so good.

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,220
Why?

19
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,250
Why?

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,624
Whyyyyyyyyy??!

24
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,480
<i>I have no jewels</i>

25
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,520
<i>I have no cake</i>

26
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,570
<i>I'm a sad little dragon
With nothing to--</i>

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,530
...Is it?

28
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,330
Oh! Oh goodness, I hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

29
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,660
Well, I do have this cake
to not bake.

30
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,850
Oh, sorry. It's a bad time.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,790
Inside joke, talk to me.

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,000
It's just that Princess Cadence
needs us to do a great job

33
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,750
welcoming the head
of the Equestria games

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,220
when she visits
the Crystal Empire tomorrow.

35
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,900
Oh, I know all about that.

36
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,390
As if I wouldn't be any help
at welcoming.

37
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,490
Oh, I don't know
what I was thinking!

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,210
Of course, you might be upset
for not being invited,

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,010
and here I am coming to ask you
for a favor.

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,640
You were probably
going to say no, anyway.

41
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,450
All I had to offer you in exchange
was one little jewel.

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,110
What was that?

43
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,519
All I have is this jewel.

44
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,080
That's a really big one.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,370
A really big, juicy,
perfect for a cake-topper jewel.

46
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,380
Does this mean you'll do it?

47
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,200
Yeah, sure.

48
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,300
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,350
So while I'm gone,
you'll take care of Angel,

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,120
and tomorrow is Tuesday,
which is his tail fluffing day.

51
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,850
And it's really important
for him to look good.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,450
Wait, what? You want me
to take care of him?

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,710
Oh, well, yes.

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,730
But if it's too much
trouble,

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,860
I can always see
if there's somepony else.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,860
We already agreed on the
whole jewel thing, so I'll just--

57
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,910
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

58
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,710
Angel, aren't you
just so excited?

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,000
See you tomorrow.

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,470
You know, she's not
the only pony with a pet

61
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,100
that might need
some watching.

62
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,800
All I'm saying is if Fluttershy thought
that her beloved little friend

63
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,800
shouldn't be left alone while
you're busy in the Crystal Empire,

64
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,320
then maybe that's just
something to think about.

65
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,910
Tank's not some fuzzy
little bunny.

66
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,910
He can take care of himself.

67
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,510
He's a strong, fearless
and totally together pet.

68
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,480
All right, you can watch him.

69
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,420
But only because, uh...

70
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,480
Tank's got a strict
flying regimen

71
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,890
and someone needs to make sure
that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone.

72
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,700
You know, the two of us
are very diligent.

73
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,300
Okay, whatever.

74
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,500
Yes, yes. And more importantly,
as for Opal,

75
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,600
she likes to eat every
36 and a half minutes.

76
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,390
You groom her with
her silken brush, head to toe.

77
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,600
And don't forget to pooch
her pillow out in the middle,

78
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,710
that's where she likes it.

79
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,200
And the temperature in the room
should always be exactly 81.4 degrees.

80
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,880
That's the only way
she can get to sleep.

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,530
So thanks for your help
and good luck to you.

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,100
I think the dragon was expecting
a little something for his efforts.

83
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,530
Almost as beautiful
as the pony who gave it to me.

84
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,790
Shouldn't you be critter-proofing
the library or something?

85
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,230
Tank has a tendency to--

86
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,960
Critter-proofing.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

87
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,990
Three down, three to go.

88
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,670
What's that you said, Gummy?

89
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, you're just gonna have
to ask Pinkie Pie about that one.

90
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,450
Ask me! Ask me!

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,270
Go ahead, ask her.

92
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,810
Of course,
you can have another cupcake!

93
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,530
Yeah. Why didn't you say so?

94
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,320
I'll get you a bigger pond
immediately.

95
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,280
I think what Gummy's
trying to say is--

96
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,110
He's always wanted a pair
of riding pants?

97
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,040
His toenails need
a new coat of shellack?

98
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,950
He wants to floss twice a day
instead of just once?

99
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,130
I think what Gummy is trying to say
is that he'd like a little Spike time.

100
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,540
Who wouldn't?
Spike time is the best.

101
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,640
Alas, it doesn't come cheap.

102
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,260
All I'm saying is that you might
wanna think about a helmet.

103
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,850
You only wanna get hit in the head
by a flying turtle... once.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,490
A thousand plus carats
of pure deliciousness.

105
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,560
Looks like you got a regular
pet day care in here, Spike.

106
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
You'll still be able to get
some good playtime

107
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,610
with Winona like you said,
though, won't you?

108
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,540
She tends to get a little wild
if she doesn't get her exercise.

109
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,450
Exercise, sure, of course.

110
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,310
I don't remember seeing
critters on the invite list.

111
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,240
That's because we're leaving
them here with Spike.

112
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,580
He's gonna do a little
critter sitting for us.

113
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,970
Oh, really?

114
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,850
So sorry I'm late.
Silly bunny had hidden his brush.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,480
Be sure you get plenty
on his tail

116
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,480
or it won't get as poofy
as he likes it.

117
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,950
Come on, girls,
or we're gonna miss the train.

118
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,200
One more for the road.

119
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,900
Oh, you little puppy,
come on here.

120
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,850
I love you more.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
No, I love you more!

122
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,330
I love you more!!

123
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,360
Oh, I promise
it will be okay.

124
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,870
I'll fluff your tail
twice next week.

125
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,060
Three times?

126
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,550
Oh, I know, it's a chilly
81.2 in here.

127
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,000
Spike, take care of this,
would you please?

128
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,000
You got it!

129
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,140
So, what're you thinking about
that hooting little friend of yours?

130
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,450
Suppose you'll want me
to keep an eye on him too.

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,900
That would be nice.

132
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,020
You sure you don't already
have your hands full?

133
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,880
Ah. I'll be fine!

134
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,450
But, just between you and me,

135
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,910
I've gotta give priority
to the paying customers.

136
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,320
You're absolutely sure
you can do this?

137
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,650
Of course! Wouldn't have
agreed to it if I couldn't.

138
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,990
Piece of cake.
Speaking of cake,

139
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,580
I've got a little something
I need to attend to.

140
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,710
Yeah, like, keeping an eye
on a house full of critters.

141
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,960
Uh, yeah. That was totally
what I was talking about.

142
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,450
Relax! Go to your welcoming
thing in the Crystal Empire.

143
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,230
Spike's got it all under control.

144
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,800
All right, sidekicks!
Front and center!

145
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,520
There are six of you,

146
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,720
but there's only one
right here in front of me!

147
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,930
Two. And what I say goes!

148
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,730
Spike, the boss of you,
that's who.

149
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,620
One, two, three!

150
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,320
Come on, number four.

151
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,410
One, two, three, four, five.

152
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,950
Who's missing?

153
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,360
Angel.

154
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,730
All I wanted were some jewels.
Big, juicy delicious jewels.

155
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,430
And now what do I have?
A missing rabbit and--

156
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,110
Oh, little fluffy Angel Bunnykins,

157
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,890
you're so cute!

158
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,210
The natural waves in his fluff
are to die for.

159
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,650
Isn't Angel just the cutest thing
you've ever seen?

160
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,190
Look, you don't wanna
be with me.

161
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,210
I'd rather not chase you around
all over the place

162
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,200
when I could be enjoying
some jewel cake.

163
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,300
Watch me solve
both our problems.

164
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,720
You know, I'm supposed to be
watching him,

165
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,900
but you all have just hit it off
so well, that maybe--

166
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,770
Maybe I could let you
take care of him instead.

167
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,240
We would, but we've got some major
Crusaders business planned for today.

168
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,610
Major. We're getting our
skydiving Cutie Marks today!

169
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,300
Well, I suppose
if you've got other plans...

170
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,650
It's just--
You're so good with him.

171
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,080
Like "get a Cutie Mark
for bunny-sitting" good.

172
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
A bunny-sitting Cutie Mark.

173
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,893
That would be adorable!

174
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,030
He does seem to like us.

175
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,750
And we hadn't exactly
figured out

176
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,660
how we're going to pull off
this whole skydiving thing.

177
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,750
You know what?

178
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,260
As hard as it's gonna be for me
to part with these little guys,

179
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,170
I think you should probably
just take all of them.

180
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,450
If you ask me, the more critters
you take care of,

181
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,280
the more chances you have of getting
some kind of critter-sitting Cutie Mark.

182
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,480
Am I right?
Or am I right?

183
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,480
Sure.

184
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,160
- Yes!
- But wait.

185
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,710
How are we gonna take good
care of them

186
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,500
without treats
for when they're good?

187
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,450
And we'll need beds
for when their tired!

188
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,190
And toys.
They need toys!

189
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,600
It's an afternoon.

190
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,160
They don't need all that stuff.
They'll be fine!

191
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,400
We need to be able
to buy them some things.

192
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,160
One jewel might be able
to cover it all.

193
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,500
What would I possibly
be doing with jewels?

194
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,500
I happen to know for a fact

195
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,550
that Applejack gave you a gem
to watch Winona.

196
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,810
Which means...

197
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,530
Obviously no one around here
is getting a Cutie Mark

198
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,980
for kindness towards a poor,
hungry little dragon.

199
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,140
Take it or leave it!

200
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,420
We'll take it.

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,480
<i>Gonna put in some flour
And add a little sugar</i>

202
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,080
<i>For my five
Delicious jewels</i>

203
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,450
But pink feathers would look
so good with your eyes!

204
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,620
That bird could use
a little color.

205
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,880
Has anyone seen Tank's head?
Where's his head?!

206
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,000
What've you done
to the turtle?!

207
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,460
Oh, he totally forgot
he could do that.

208
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,590
Yeah. So pretty sure
critter-sitting Cutie Marks are out.

209
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,120
And our critter-grooming
Cutie Marks

210
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,100
probably aren't going to appear
any time soon either.

211
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,600
All right,
load them up.

212
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,820
And you can give me back
that jewel I gave you.

213
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,390
Sorry.
We don't have it anymore.

214
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,800
What? Why not?

215
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,450
How do you think we paid
for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer?

216
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,140
Zecora knows just what to do

217
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,300
about all this bad mojo
that's floating around you.

218
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,190
I'm thinking a cage
and a great big lock might be next.

219
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,100
Zecora can take the bad away
if you do just what I say.

220
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,100
Really?

221
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,600
But before I can do my duty,

222
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,490
I'm going to need
some of your booty.

223
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,660
Where are you going?

224
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,700
You think jewels
are what you need,

225
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,960
but there's no worse mojo
than dragon greed.

226
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,700
Almost there.

227
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,280
Just taking good care
of everyone's animals!

228
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,320
What am I gonna have to do
to get this to go away?

229
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,790
Then this is just
between you and me, right?

230
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,220
No other pony
has to hear a word about it?

231
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,340
A word about what now?

232
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,650
This better be important.

233
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,270
All aboard!

234
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,819
Angel!

235
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,230
I can't have all of these
animals on my train.

236
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,610
Not without tickets
and not without chaperones.

237
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,530
All I need is to get
on for one minute,

238
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,610
grab a bunny and get off!
Promise.

239
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,420
A likely story.

240
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,620
No chaperone, no train!

241
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,620
Skydiving Cutie Marks!

242
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,460
Is three ponies enough?

243
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,930
At least I have you two left,
my delectable little treasures.

244
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,760
All aboard
for the Crystal Empire!

245
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,190
Crystal Empire?!

246
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,700
I've always wanted to see
the Crystal Empire!

247
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,570
I wish I were dressed for it,
but still... the Crystal Empire!

248
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,110
We're not really going.

249
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,410
We just needed to get on the train
so I can get that rabbit!

250
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,530
And when I do, we're off!

251
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,710
- What?
- It's not fair!

252
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,190
There he is!

253
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,790
Next stop, the Crystal Empire.

254
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,450
No, no, no, no, no!

255
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,760
So it seems the Crystal Empire

256
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,580
would be really cold,
but I've heard that it's not.

257
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,260
It's as warm as can be!

258
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,630
Do you think the walls are crystal?
Maybe even see-through?

259
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,990
Can you imagine?
See-through walls!

260
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,910
Take it. Just take it!

261
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,880
It's so beautiful.

262
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,030
Well, enjoy it while you can.

263
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,550
We're not getting out of this car
until we're back in Ponyville.

264
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,330
There is no way, no how,

265
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,090
we're coming all the way
to the Crystal Empire

266
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,460
without looking around!

267
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,010
No pony's gonna get past
this dragon!

268
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,930
Don't make me use this!

269
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,900
You wouldn't dare!

270
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,790
Oh no!

271
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
Whoa. Just whoa.

272
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,260
I'm in crystal heaven!

273
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,720
Shh. Quiet there!

274
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,170
There's the bunny!

275
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,440
Please, please. Pretty please,
don't go down there.

276
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,610
I'll fluff your tail!

277
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,440
I'll perm, highlight and blow it out
if you'll just stop!

278
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,330
What do you want?
Name it, and it's yours.

279
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,200
Oh, my goodness.

280
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,100
All aboard!

281
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,890
You're coming with me.

282
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,280
We made it!

283
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,300
Without seeing the palace!

284
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,810
I think this car's empty!

285
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,730
They're coming this way.
Everybody down!

286
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,730
There has got to be
a better solution!

287
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,020
Don't sit down,
don't sit down!

288
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,160
My dogs are barking!

289
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,620
Did y'all hear that?
They really are!

290
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,010
Bummer, Spike got
to miss out on all this.

291
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,410
He would have had fun here.

292
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,440
I'm sure he's havinga great time
watching all the critters back at home.

293
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,360
Think he's still got a handle
on things?

294
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,550
If he is staying calm
and collected,

295
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,200
I bet he is doing
a terrific job as a leader.

296
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,850
Go ahead, bunny.
Do your worst.

297
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,350
I deserve it.

298
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,330
I ignored you,

299
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,550
tried to pawn you off
on someone else...

300
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,630
I didn't take these silly things out
or fluff this like I was supposed to.

301
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,340
I wasn't really thinking
about you at all.

302
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,230
Any of you.
Just wanted the jewels.

303
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,730
I hope you'll all forgive me
someday.

304
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,990
You will?

305
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,630
Oh, great.

306
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,850
I'm gonna be the one
who gives us away.

307
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,180
Where did you--?

308
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,440
You all hear that?

309
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,870
I can't wait to scratch
the belly on Winona!

310
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,280
Oh, I miss her.

311
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,370
I can't wait
to see Owlowicious!

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,450
Hello!

313
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,670
Thought we'd meet you
at the station!

314
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,930
So we could hear all about
the Crystal Empire

315
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,240
and find out if you brought us
one of the Crystal snow globes

316
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,850
that they sell
at the train station.

317
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,300
How did you know
about the snow globes?

318
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,990
Lucky guess?

319
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,250
I've gotta hand it to you,
Spike.

320
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,270
You did a really good job
of taking care of the animals.

321
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,950
Oh, Spike,
Angel looks perfect!

322
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,730
You did such a good job
fluffing his tail!

323
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,510
Yeah, well,
we're like this now.

324
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,630
You know who.

325
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,160
So, what are you thinking?
Bake them into a jewel pie?

326
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,650
Six-layer gem cake
sounds pretty good!

327
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,400
Yeah, it does.

328
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,870
It really, really does.

329
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,150
Whyyyyyyyy??!
