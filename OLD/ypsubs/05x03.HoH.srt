out with me is awesome

rather keep losing than--

Why is this so hard?

358
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:55,806
We're Twilight's best friends.

359
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,524
This should be easy for us!

360
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,328
She said it herself: if
anypony should be able

361
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:03,077
to make her feel comfortable
in her new home, it's us.

362
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:04,997
If we can't do it...

363
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,692
...then Twilight will be
stuck living in a castle

364
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,564
that just makes her
feel sad...

365
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:14,270
[echoes] ...sad...sad.

366
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:17,077
Wow, Fluttershy, I
didn't know you could be

367
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,400
loud enough to echo.

368
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:24,661
[muttering to
herself]

369
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,880
What do we do?
What do we do?

370
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,404
If Twilight comes home
now she'll be like

371
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:29,431
"What did you guys do?"

372
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:30,976
And we'll have to
be like "NOTHING!"

373
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:32,968
And then she'll be like
"I was counting on you!

374
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:34,227
Some friends you are!"

375
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:35,827
and we'll be like "AAAHHH!"

376
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,964
[blubbering]

377
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,968
Calm down, Pinkie.

378
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,034
We just need to figure
out what we did wrong

379
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,460
so we can make it right.

380
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:46,235
Rarity: Well, I didn't
do anything wrong.

381
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,623
I did exactly what I would
do if this were my home.

382
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,591
But it's not your home;
it's Twilight's home!

383
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,597
Where she keeps all her
Rainbow Dash trophies?

384
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:55,684
Touché.

385
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,625
Fluttershy: Maybe we're
all a little guilty

386
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,345
of making ourselves feel at
home instead of Twilight.

387
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,747
Come on, y'all, we just need
to think about Twilight!

388
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,528
What was it she
loved about living

389
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,048
in the Golden Oak Library?

390
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:08,795
Oh, everything!

391
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:10,564
The books, the
smell of books,

392
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:13,073
the joy she felt from
organizing books.

393
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,456
Remember that time I crashed
into all those books

394
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,597
attempting my Sonic Rainboom
after you guys just cleaned up?

395
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:21,886
[sigh] That was good times.

396
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:23,427
Yeah, for YOU, maybe.

397
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:24,770
Rarity: Oh and Applejack,

398
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:27,418
remember when we were stuck
having a sleepover there?

399
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:30,071
That turned out
to be so much fun!

400
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:33,650
Remember the time it got
blown up to smithereens?

401
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,124
Wait, no. That
was the worst!

402
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:40,277
We had a lot of good
memories there, though.

403
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,178
That's what made the
Golden Oak Library home.

404
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,797
[all agree]

405
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,823
[gasp] That's it!

406
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:49,983
How's that one?

407
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:50,837
Too soft?

408
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:51,827
Too hard?

409
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,141
Too lumpy?

410
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,393
Ummm...

411
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:58,892
Just right! I'll take it!

412
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:00,922
Oh, thank goodness.

413
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,913
I thought you'd never
find one you liked.

414
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,191
Let's find a salespony
and get out of here.

415
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,090
Sounds good to me!

416
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,444
I mean, uh...

417
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:12,084
Do you hear that?

418
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:14,016
[imitates a squeak]

419
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,997
Too squeaky.

420
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:16,303
Better keep looking.

Applejack: [sigh]

423
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:22,004
Maybe my plan won't
work after all.

424
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,993
Of course it will,
darling! I can see it!

425
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,766
You and Fluttershy stay here.

Oh. I, uh, love what you've
done with the place!

preserving the integrity
of the original design.

It looks exactly the same!

Keep me from coming back here?

450
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,418
It took a teensy bit
longer than we thought.

00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:49,667
What really makes home feel like
home isn't what it looks like,

it's the memories you
make when you're there.

Truth be told, I
couldn't either.

Your kitchen might have some
rustic farm decor, Twilight.

some Daring Do posters
