1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,600
Aw, snickerdoodle!
Where is the darn thing?

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,500
I wish for once I'd remember
to label these boxes.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,410
Big Mac, be a dear and
help me move those.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,800
Maybe it's in that
one on the bottom.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,060
Oh, dagnabbit, it's
not in there either.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,850
You can't catch me! Hey!

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,350
OK! Ha ha ha! You trickster!

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,230
Sisterhooves Social is
right around the corner.

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,900
Thought it'd be nice to award
the winner of the big race

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,950
a ribbon from when we hosted
the very first Social.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,780
If of course I can
find the darn thing.

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,100
Awww, would ya lookie here?

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,900
My, how Apple Bloom used
to love watching you

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,200
make that thing fly. It's like
she thought you were magic.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,300
All right, enough
reminiscin'.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,750
Gotta find that ribbon.

17
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,900
If you would just
help me

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,400
then maybe I can ...

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,850
Uh, Big Mac?

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,480
Found 'er!

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:42,350
Regular subtitles

We have muffins!
https://yayponies.eu/

22
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,390
S-I-S-T-E-R-S! Which two
sisters are the best? We are!

23
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,860
Apple Bloom and Applejack
forever. Yeeee-hewww!

24
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,100
We are gonna win
every competition

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,500
at the Sisterhooves
Social!

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Those other fillies aren't
gonna know what hit 'em.

27
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,530
Oh, hey there, Big Mac.
Did you want something?

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,670
Eyup.

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,600
Hold that thought.

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Applejack, you are the
most awesome sister ever.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,140
Aw, gee whiz. Heh.

32
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,200
Well, I think it's sweet that
you hold that opinion, but--

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,550
It's not opinion.
It's objective fact.

34
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,350
You've saved Equestria
like a gazillion times.

35
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,350
You're smart. Funny. Strong.

36
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,450
Why you're the best
sister of all time!

37
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,150
Probably the best Apple of
all time! Right, Big Mac?

38
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,800
Eyup.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,100
And with you by my
side, I am guaranteed

40
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,170
to taste sweet, sweet
Sisterhooves Social victory!

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,350
Go Apples. Go,
go, go Apples, go!

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,950
Uh, Apple Bloom? I think
Big Mac's got something

43
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,850
he wants to show you.

44
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,400
Oh, hey! Is that the toy we used
to play with when I was little?

45
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,200
Eyup.

46
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,800
Neat. All right then! Let's
get back to practicin'!

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,700
One more run-through of
our juggling routine,

48
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,150
make sure our harmonies
are tight on our song,

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,800
and see if we can't beat
our best pie-eatin' time.

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,470
Hold on, sugar cube. I need a
minute to talk with Big Mac.

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,050
Mind if I go ahead and
start eating this pie?

52
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,740
Hey Big Mac, you all right?

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,340
Eyup.

54
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,540
You sure? You seemed a
little down back there.

55
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,200
 Nope.

56
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,340
Come on, you can tell me. You
feelin' a little left out?

57
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,910
Apple Bloom and I have been
spendin' a lot of time together

58
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,000
gettin' ready for the Social.

59
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,080
What in the--?

60
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,940
Your Cutie Mark!

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,600
You're being summoned,
Applejack! This is so cool!

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,620
Eyup.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
Wonder where you're
being called to?

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,880
Wonder what you're supposed
to do when you get there?

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,340
Obviously it is something
awesome because you're awesome!

66
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,200
But if you're being summoned
to solve a friendship problem,

67
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,420
that means you'll have to
miss the Sisterhooves Social.

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,170
And if you have to
miss the Social,

69
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,600
then I'll have to
miss the Social,

70
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,650
which means I won't be able to
taste sweet, sweet victory!

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,770
Now calm down. Let me just
go over to Twilight's castle

72
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,620
and see what's what.

73
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,970
Maybe it's just a false alarm.

74
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,910
But you said it
was a false alarm!

75
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,400
I said "maybe"
it's a false alarm.

76
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,080
Well, it's not. Rarity and
I have to go to Manehattan.

77
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,750
Can't you just tell that map

78
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,220
it'll have to wait
a couple days?

79
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,950
No can do, sugar cube.

80
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,880
When duty calls, I
gotta answer right away.

81
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,000
What kind of an example would I
be settin' for my little sister

82
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,730
if I didn't?

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,510
This. Can't. Be. Happening!

84
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,910
Your extreme awesomeness
is backfiring on me!

85
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm sorry,
Apple Bloom.

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,040
Try and cheer her
up, won't you?

87
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,050
Eyup.

88
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,410
Breakfast! Come an' git it!

89
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,020
Oh, it's no use, Big Mac.
If I know my Apple Bloom,

90
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,000
she won't come out
of a funk this funky

91
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,660
till her big sister gets back.

92
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,600
Hey Apple Bloom, the Social is
going to start in a few hours.

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,940
Thought you might
wanna go with us.

94
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,140
Since Rarity and
Applejack are out of town,

95
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,370
you and Sweetie Belle can cheer
on me and Rainbow Dash instead.

96
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,400
Pretty great they're
letting you participate,

97
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,480
even though you're not
technically sisters.

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,650
Social's always had a
pretty loose definition

99
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,310
of what consti-ma-tutes
a sister.

100
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,020
Long as you share a bond
that represents the spirit

101
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,770
of the Social, you're in.

102
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,200
So...what do you say?

103
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,080
You coming?

104
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,250
Why not? I got
nothin' better to do.

105
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,870
Let me wash up and I'll
meet you in a little bit.

106
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,250
Oh, such a shame we
don't live closer

107
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,110
to all your second cousins.

108
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,420
You could maybe do the Social
with one of them instead.

109
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,250
What is it, Big Mac?
Y'all got an idea?

110
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,510
Eyup.

111
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,880
What? What is it?

112
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,710
Today's our big day!

113
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,880
We have so got this!

114
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm gonna go sign us in.

115
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,570
I guess I'm just
a little jealous

116
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,250
you two get to
compete and I don't.

117
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,570
But at least I get to be
here and cheer you on.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,010
I thought Apple Bloom was
going to be here, too.

119
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,400
Guess she changed her mind.

120
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,420
Hey! There you are.

121
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,020
You ready to cheer on me and
Rainbow Dash to victory?

122
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,880
Uh, not exactly.

123
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,570
Seems I'm gonna get to
participate after all.

124
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,770
Applejack is back from
Manehattan already?

125
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,800
That must mean
Rarity is back, too!

126
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,650
No. Our sisters are still gone.

127
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,340
But it, uh, turns out my long
lost cousin Orchard Blossom

128
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,000
was able to make it last minute.

129
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,170
Your cousin whowhatnow?

130
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,140
Well, I
do declare it's hotter today

131
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,250
than the business end of
a corn cob pipe.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,140
Oh my, I am so delighted to
meet your little friends,

133
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,970
Apple Bloom.

134
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,020
Would these be your dear and
beloved Cutie Mark Crusaders?

135
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,450
Sweetie Belle
and Scootaloo,

136
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,170
Cousin Orchard Blossom.

137
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,620
It is my extraordinary pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

138
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,880
That's Big Mac in a dress.

139
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,820
"Big Mac?" Why as charmed
as I am that you find me

140
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,480
in the slightest resemblance to
such a fine and noble product

141
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,770
of the Apple clan, I'm
astonished in equal measure.

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,880
However, I shall take this
startling observation

143
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,770
under advisement, given that
it's from such an astute

144
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,000
and perceptive filly as
yourself, Sweetie Belle.

145
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,170
That's awful nice of you to
say, Cousin Orchard Blossom.

146
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,200
I've been told before
I'm pretty observant.

147
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,450
I haven't the slightest doubt.

148
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,140
Pardon me,

149
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,660
my dearest cousin Applejack is
regrettably unable to be here

150
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,050
as planned, so I, her
Cousin Orchard Blossom,

151
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,820
will accompany Apple
Bloom in her stead.

152
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I trust that's acceptable
to all concerned?

153
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,340
Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh?

154
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,840
I know Applejack has
a lot of relatives,

155
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,710
but I feel like she
would have mentioned you.

156
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,280
Why, you must be Rainbow Dash!

157
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,220
You're Scootaloo's... how
are y'all related again?

158
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,910
Why don't I just let
you finish signing in?

159
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,160
But don't think me and Scootaloo
are gonna take it easy on you

160
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,370
just 'cause you're a stallion.

161
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,740
Now where were we?

162
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,570
Um, excuse me, I have
to... go to the bathroom.

163
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,080
You mean "powder your
muzzle," don't you, dear?

164
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,310
Such a more feminine-like
reference to nature's call,

165
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,310
don't you agree?

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Have they called your
brother's bluff yet?

167
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,630
No, but they're about to.
I can't bear to watch.

168
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,060
Yoo hoo, Apple Bloom!

169
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,900
They've approved us
as a pair!

170
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,020
Hurry along now, precious.

171
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,910
I can't believe they bought it.

172
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,040
It's sweet he wants to help you
out like this. Weird. But sweet.

173
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,380
Bravo. Bravo! Weren't
those two sisters great?

174
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,800
Now where are our
next competitors?

175
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,690
Here we are!

176
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,300
This one please.

177
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,850
Excellent choice... ma'am.

178
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,570
You sure you know all the words?

179
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,910
cause it took Applejack a pretty
long time to get it down.

180
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,400
Did it now?

181
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,780
<i> âª We all love our brothers âª</i>

182
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,290
<i>âª and our fathers and mothers âª</i>

183
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,690
<i> âª We honour them like</i>
<i> every family should âª</i>

184
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,930
<i> âª But there's something</i>
<i> that's quite unique âª</i>

185
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,830
<i> âª When my sister's</i>
<i> there with me âª</i>

186
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,400
<i> âª And we share that special</i>
<i> bond of sisterhood âª</i>

187
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,810
<i> âª Sisterhood...</i>
<i> [Sisterhooooood] âª</i>

188
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,680
<i>âª Is a special kind of friend âª</i>

189
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,780
âª Sisterhood...
[Sisterhooooood] âª

190
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,820
<i> âª Is a bond that never ends âª</i>

191
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,850
<i> âª It's not always perfect âª</i>

192
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,060
<i> âª You might fight or</i>
<i> be misunderstood âª</i>

193
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,680
<i> âª But together</i>
<i> you'll always have âª</i>

194
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,760
<i> âª Sisterhood âª</i>

195
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,460
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

196
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,960
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

197
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,430
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

198
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,030
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

199
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,470
<i> âª Sisterhood...... âª</i>

200
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,550
<i>âª Sisterhooooooood.... âª</i>

201
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,890
Heh heh! Are you OK,
Cousin Orchard Blossom?

202
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,050
You sounded like you
were catching a cold

203
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,150
or something else

204
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,390
that would make your voice
sound totally different

205
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,050
right at the end
of the song.

206
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,500
Just a frog in
my throat, dear.

207
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,340
Probably just need to
get a sip of water.

208
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
If you'll excuse us,

209
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,500
we've another event in
which to participate.

210
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,600
Oh, my, that certainly
didn't go as I had planned.

211
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,850
But don't you worry.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,400
We'll get you a blue
ribbon, yet, Apple Bloom.

213
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,000
You sure about that?

214
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,950
As sure as my name is
Cousin Orchard Blossom.

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,060
But that isn't your name.

216
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,990
C-O-U-S-I-N-S!

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,530
Which two sisters, er,
cousins, are the best? We are!

218
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,400
Apple Bloom and Applejack,
I mean Orchard Jack,

219
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,750
Blossom forever. Yay!

220
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,000
Yay.

221
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,350
Oh, I don't know
why I didn't choose

222
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,480
to wear something more casual.

223
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,050
Why I knew that juggling routine
like the back of my hoof.

224
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,200
But never you mind, there is
still the race to be run.

225
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,200
I really appreciate
all the effort Big Ma--

226
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,300
Cousin Orchard Blossom,
but maybe we just skip

227
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,000
the whole obstacle course
thing and call it a day.

228
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,500
Why, Apple Bloom, I
wouldn't hear of it.

229
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,500
Your Cousin Orchard
Blossom may be many things,

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,600
but she is not a quitter.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm sure she's not. But,
it's like Applejack said,

232
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,800
there'll be more Sisterhooves
Socials down the line.

233
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,380
I'm sure she'll help me get a
blue ribbon next time around.

234
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,480
But you wanted to win at
this Sisterhooves Social.

235
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,700
And no matter what, I am
going to get you that win.

236
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,620
Why I simply have to.

237
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,030
All right, Scootaloo,

238
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,930
remember the parts where
teamwork really comes into play.

239
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,640
How could I forget? We've
been training all week.

240
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,150
OK, hot stuff. What's our
move on the grape squish?

241
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,880
The alley oop.

242
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,600
Apple Toss?

243
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,300
Flip flop.

244
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,800
Egg carry?

245
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
Flutter bomb.

246
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,950
Yeah!

247
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,150
Oh, dear.

248
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,700
Competisisters,
take your positions.

249
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,500
And ready. And set. Go!

250
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,900
Nice jump, Scoot!

251
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,100
Woohoo!

252
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,000
Yikes! You almost squished ME!

253
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,650
Pick up those
hooves, Apple Bloom!

254
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,480
Why you're barely
moving at a mosey!

255
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,050
Come on, junebug;

256
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,700
it's like you've never
carried an egg before.

257
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,800
I'm goin' as fast as I can!

258
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,400
Hey!

259
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,410
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

260
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,090
Woo-hoo!

261
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,450
I mean, victory is
ours, sweet Apple Bloom!

262
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,430
Uh-oh.

263
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,350
Uh-oh, indeed.

264
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,700
I should have known
you'd eventually get busted

265
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,240
for being a stallion.

266
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,610
Oh, no. We've
known all along.

267
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,610
The Sisterhooves Social has
always had a loose policy

268
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,150
when it comes to what
counts as a "sister".

269
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,420
But we do have a strict policy
when it comes to sportsponyship.

270
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,000
In your "sister's" desperation
to win, he used brute strength

271
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,300
to physically take
out the competitors.

272
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,630
That kind of behavior is not
just unbecoming of a lady,

273
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,050
but, quite frankly, of anypony.

274
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,050
And for that, you two
are hereby disqualified.

275
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,650
Looks like we win, squirt.

276
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,150
Woo-hoo!

277
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,350
I told you I should have just
waited until the next social

278
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,550
to win with Applejack.

279
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
You know, I'm not
mad, right?

280
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,050
Eyup.

281
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,870
I mean, let's face it,

282
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,500
you dressing up as my
Cousin Orchard Blossom

283
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,780
was a pretty crazy idea
in the first place.

284
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,600
Eyup.

285
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,900
And it's not like you got me
disqualified from the Social

286
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,150
forever or anything.

287
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,100
I can participate next time with
Applejack. Everything's fine.

288
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,600
Eyup.

289
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,100
I just don't understand
why you went so crazy there

290
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,330
at the end of the race.

291
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean, I know you like
to win and all, but...

292
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,900
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

293
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,850
Nope.

294
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,240
All right. Well, it's
getting late. You coming?

295
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,100
Nope.

296
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,280
OK. See you
later, I guess.

297
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,720
Apple Bloom?

298
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,700
Yeah?

299
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,890
When you were little, you
used to look up to me.

300
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,750
Thought I was the best
thing since zap-apple jam.

301
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,360
Things are different now.

302
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,500
Applejack's the hero
of the Apple family.

303
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,800
Always rushin' off
to save Equestria.

304
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,100
And I'm just here on
the farm. Doin' chores.

305
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,650
Helpin' out the way I can.

306
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,900
Nothin' special. Nobody's hero.
I guess I just thought...

307
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,850
Aw, never mind. Here I am
about to start blabberin' on

308
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,650
about my feelings. You don't
want to hear all this.

309
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,950
Yes, I do.

310
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,400
I guess I just thought if I
could fill in for Applejack

311
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,550
at the Social and get
you a blue ribbon,

312
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,450
well, I could be somepony
you looked up to again.

313
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,400
Be your hero again. Even
if it was for just a day.

314
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,700
It was foolish.
And I'm ashamed.

315
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,570
Please. I just want
to be alone right now.

316
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,210
Yeah well, too
bad, you big goof.

317
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,410
'Cause I'm not
going anywhere.

318
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,750
And I know that you're always
gonna be here when I need you.

319
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,350
Heck, you'll do a whole
obstacle course in high heels

320
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,650
if you think it'll help
me get somethin' I want.

321
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
You're my big brother.

322
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,650
You've always been a hero to me,
Big Mac, and you always will be.

323
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm real sorry I haven't
been lettin' you know

324
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
that's how I feel.

325
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,950
Guess both of us have
been holdin' back

326
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,350
when it comes to
expressin' ourselves, huh?

327
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,600
Eyup.

328
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,480
Big Mac! Apple Bloom!

329
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Your sister's home! She says
she's got quite a story to tell

330
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,380
about her trip to Manehattan.

331
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,900
Be there in a bit.

332
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,150
I'm spending some quality
time with my big brother!

333
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,530
Hey, Big Mac.

334
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,830
Eyup.

335
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,850
How do you think
Cousin Orchard Blossom

336
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,150
would describe this sunset?

337
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,050
Why, dear, I do declare this
is the most beautiful sunset

338
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,340
my eyes have ever looked upon.

339
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,200
Though sittin' here
on these tree roots

340
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,010
is a trifle uncomfortable
for my hindquarters.
