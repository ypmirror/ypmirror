1
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:07,773
Quill.

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,454
Check.

3
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:11,475
Parchment.

4
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:12,209
Check.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,035
Extra ink.

6
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:13,557
Check.

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:14,968
Extra-extra ink.

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:15,894
Check.

9
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:17,850
Is that everything on the checklist?

10
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,186
-Yep!
-Great.

11
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,521
Now that we've completed the checklist
of things we need to create a checklist...

12
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,984
...we can make my checklist of the things
I have to get done by the end of the day.

13
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:27,274
Ready?

14
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:28,462
Ready!

15
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:32,835
Item 1: Create checklist of the things
I have to accomplish by the end of the day.

16
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:19,956
How are we doing, Spike?

17
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:21,343
Let's see...

18
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:23,136
We've already dropped off
your cape at the cleaner's...

19
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:25,133
...returned the blackboard
you borrowed from Cheerilee...

20
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:27,574
...ordered new parchment and quills
from the stationery shop...

21
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:31,064
Hmm... Seems like we just placed
an order for those a few days ago.

22
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:35,158
Can imagine why we go
through so many of them.

23
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,213
Sounds like we're ahead
of schedule. What's next?

24
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,215
Cupcakes!

25
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:46,512
Uh, I only ordered twelve.

26
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:47,944
Oh, I know, dear.

27
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:51,552
But I had an extra, so I though
I'd make it a baker's dozen.

28
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:55,366
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.

29
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,884
It's just some of the icing
from the extra cupcake...

30
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,778
...is getting all over
the one next to it. See?

31
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,172
Oh! Sure.

32
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,533
It's just that I'm planning on
sharing these at a picnic later...

33
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:10,090
...and I don't want anypony to feel like
somepony else is getting more icing.

34
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:13,798
Oh... no, of course not.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,418
Not to worry.

36
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:17,649
I'll just move some of this one to...

37
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:20,980
Hmm... I think I may have
scooped too much.

38
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,252
Oops! Now those two have more.

39
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,189
Let's just try this again.

40
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:29,747
Hmm... No, that won't do.

41
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:33,062
Let me just... hmm...
put some here, then...

42
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:37,408
No, that's not right. A little more
on this one, a little bit... wait...

43
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:42,079
I'll just... Ooh, a little bit
here... here... and...

44
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:43,295
Perfect!

45
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:46,791
Hmm, oh yes. Much better.

46
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,583
Okay! Time to tackle
the next item on our...

47
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:50,705
Oops!

48
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:54,582
Looks like we're gonna have to add
"Give a baby dragon a bath" to our list.

49
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:02,029
Very efficient! And a little bit gross.

50
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:04,855
Looks like that's everything.

51
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,769
Almost everything.

52
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,289
"Triple-check checklist to make sure
we didn't miss anything..."

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,701
"...when the double-checked
the checklist".

54
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,409
Uh, check.

55
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:19,738
I've been holding that quill so long
I've got a claw cramp.

56
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:24,234
Good thing we don't have anything
to report to Princess Celestia this week.

57
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:26,264
I don't think I can write another word.

58
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:29,354
We haven't sent a letter
to Princess Celestia this week?!

59
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:30,966
Why? Is that bad?

60
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:33,309
Bad?! BAD?! Of course it's bad!

61
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,912
I'm supposed to send Princess
Celestia a letter every week...

62
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:38,020
...telling her about a lesson
I've learned about friendship!

63
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:40,402
Not every other week.
Not every ten days.

64
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,736
Every! Single! Week!

65
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,607
Where's my calendar?!
Where's my calendar?!

66
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:49,002
Where it always is?

67
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:51,882
When did we send the last one?

68
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,124
Last Tuesday?

69
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:56,457
And today is...

70
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:57,964
Tuesday?

71
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,924
Nonononononono...

72
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:04,911
If I don't send her a letter
by sundown, I'll be...

73
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,784
TARDY!!!

74
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:09,867
What's that now?

75
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,892
Tar-dy, Spike. Late! I'll be late!

76
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:16,706
Oh, how could I've let this happen?
I'm usually so organized.

77
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:18,694
I've never been late for an assignment.

78
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:21,556
Oh, please! You're the most
studious student ever.

79
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:24,994
I'm sure the princess will forgive you
if you miss one little deadline.

80
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:27,099
I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike.

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,161
This is the ruler of all of Equestria
we're talking about.

82
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:32,620
The pony who holds
my fate in her hooves.

83
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,189
What if she doesn't forgive me?

84
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,931
Yeah, I don't think she...

85
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:38,313
What if instead she starts thinking...

86
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,969
...I'm not taking my studies
on friendship seriously?

87
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,609
Why would she...

88
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,236
What if she makes me come back to
Canterlot and puts me back in school...

89
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:47,889
...and makes me *prove* I've been
taking them seriously by giving me a task?

90
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,804
What if I don't pass?!

91
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,698
-But why wouldn't you pass...
-She's my teacher!

92
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,776
Do you know what teachers do
to students who don't pass?

93
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,009
THEY SEND THEM BACK A GRADE!

94
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,649
But she won't just send me back a grade.

95
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,389
She'll send me back to...

96
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,968
...magic kindergarten.

97
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,098
Twilight.

98
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,151
Twilight!

99
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:18,629
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

100
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,576
You're not gonna be sent back
to magic kindergarten.

101
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,594
You're right. I have no reason to worry.

102
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,890
Because I'm going to solve
a friend's problem...

103
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:30,491
...and get that letter to Princess
Celestia before sundown!

104
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:32,703
So...

105
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:35,061
Got any problems, troubles, conundrums
or any other sort of issues...

106
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:38,667
...major or minor, that I as a good
friend could help you solve?

107
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,462
I got nothin'.

108
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:50,694
Then it looks like I'm gonna have to
find somepony who does.

109
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:54,184
This won't end well.

110
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:00,137
You've got this, Twilight.

111
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:03,598
You still have plenty of time to
get that letter to Princess Celestia.

112
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,272
Has to be somepony around here
who needs the help of a good friend.

113
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:09,958
Rarity!

114
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,511
Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!

115
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,117
Why me?

116
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:22,099
WHY, WHY, WHY?!

117
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,575
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

118
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:28,582
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

119
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:32,587
What's happened?! Are you all right?

120
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:36,579
I've lost my diamond
encrusted purple ribbon!

121
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,262
I have searched HIGH!
And I have searched low.

122
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:40,974
LOW AND HIGH!
High and low.

123
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,523
But I can't find it anywhere!

124
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,573
ANYWHERE!

125
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:51,425
How can I possibly finish
my latest creation if I can't find it?

126
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:55,252
Never fear, Rarity. As your friend
I'll do my best to help you fi...

127
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:56,634
Oh, there it is.

128
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:59,509
Isn't it always just
the last place you look.

129
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,429
So you just lost your ribbon...

130
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,229
...but now you've found it.

131
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,212
Yeah.

132
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:11,697
And nothing else is bothering you?

133
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,326
Nothing that I as a good friend
could help you with?

134
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,178
There is one thing.

135
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,571
YES?!

136
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,880
I think I've left my measuring tape
under the fabric over there.

137
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,552
Could you get that for me?

138
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:29,379
Measuring tape. Sure.

139
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,264
Twilight. Is there something bother...

140
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,419
Twilight.

141
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:41,529
No need to panic.
Rarity is just one pony.

142
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,909
I'm sure one of my other
friends will need me.

143
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,720
What in the world...

144
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,173
Rainbow must be angry with Applejack!

145
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:10,635
She must hate her guts. Oh, wonderful!

146
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,411
Rainbow Dash! Stop!

147
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,980
Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset
with Applejack, but don't worry.

148
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,187
Whatever it is that has
come between you two...

149
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:25,985
...I'm sure that I as a good friend
can help you resolve your problems.

150
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:29,518
Uh, what are you talking about?

151
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,418
Oh, Rainbow Dash.

152
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,561
You don't have to hide
your feelings from me.

153
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:36,399
I can tell you two must
have had a terrible fight.

154
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:41,250
Now, why don't you tell me all
about your issues with Applejack?

155
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:43,445
I don't have any issues with Applejack.

156
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:46,931
You don't? Then why are you
destroying her property?

157
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:48,464
Because she asked me to.

158
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:49,832
Right, Applejack?

159
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,026
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:54,553
I wanted to put up a new barn, but
this one's gotta come down first.

161
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,494
Now get back to it, RD.

162
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:58,664
You got it, boss!

163
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,784
I'd take cover if I were you.

164
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:29,222
I can't believe I've
wasted all that time.

165
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:31,057
I should have just come here first.

166
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:33,849
Fluttershy always has some fear
she's trying to get over.

167
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,964
As a good friend
I'll be able to help her.

168
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,292
Fluttershy?!

169
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,512
How can this be happening?!

170
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:03,042
Of all the days she had to stop being such
a scaredy-pony she had to pick today?!

171
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,322
What am I going to do?

172
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,534
You really should have
come to me sooner.

173
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:12,035
You were carrying so much
tension in that shoulder.

174
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:19,855
It's fine. It'll all be fine.
Today isn't over yet.

175
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,404
But it will be over soon!

176
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:27,701
It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville,
my advanced studies...

177
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:31,042
No, no. You're a good student.
You can do this.

178
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,319
Oh! But what if I can't?

179
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,439
You can! You just
have to keep it together.

180
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,192
Keep! It! Together!

181
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:40,492
Are you talking to... yourself?

182
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:42,749
Twilight?

183
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,116
SNAP OUT OF IT!

184
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:54,664
Huh?

185
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,374
Are you okay?

186
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:01,416
Twilight, I'm really worried.

187
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,703
I mean this letter thing
is really getting to you.

188
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,546
Here.

189
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,848
You've been so anxious all day that
you've completely forgot about the picnic.

190
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:10,132
Why don't you just relax
and go hang out with...

191
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,225
The picnic!

192
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:14,155
I should go see my friends!

193
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:16,474
I'm glad you've come to your senses.

194
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:28,184
Please tell me I did not forget the plates.

195
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,406
I did! I totally forgot them!

196
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:33,499
Of all the worst things
that could happen, this is...

197
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,858
The! Worst! Possible! Thing!

198
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:41,618
Why, why, why!

199
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,692
What?

200
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:47,347
You didn't expect me to
lay on the grass, did you?

201
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:57,323
You all right, hun?

202
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:57,993
NO!

203
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:59,707
I am not all right.

204
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,902
It's just terrible.

205
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:05,378
Yes?

206
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,959
Simply awful.

207
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,452
Yes?

208
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:10,228
It's the most terrific trouble
I've ever been in...

209
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,184
...and I really, really,
really need your help!

210
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:14,832
YES?

211
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,882
My letter to Princess Celestia
is almost overdue.

212
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:20,852
And I haven't learned
anything about friendship!

213
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:26,054
Oh, thank goodness. I thought
something really awful had happened.

214
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:30,576
Something awful HAS happened!

215
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:34,770
If I don't turn in the letter
on time, I'll be tardy!

216
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,030
TAAARDY!

217
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:42,700
No offense, sugar cube...

218
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,247
...but it looks like somepony's gettin'
themselves all worked up over nothin'.

219
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,354
This is not nothing.
This is everything!

220
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:53,040
I need you guys to help me find somepony
with a problem I can fix before sundown.

221
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,680
MY WHOLE LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!

222
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:59,237
Oh, Twilight. You're such a crackup.

223
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:01,829
Come on, now.

224
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:04,122
Have a seat and stop
sweatin' small stuff.

225
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,263
Wow. I've never seen
Twilight so upset before.

226
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:14,107
Ugh, what a drama queen.

227
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:17,331
Relatively speaking.

228
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:22,795
Clock is ticking, Twilight.

229
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,216
Clock... is... ticking!

230
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:28,081
Keep it together.

231
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,395
If I can't find a friendship problem...

232
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:34,283
...I'll *make* a friendship problem!

233
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:54,754
Hai, gurls!

234
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:57,982
Oh. Hi, Twilight. How's it goi..

235
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:00,264
Guh-reat! Just great!

236
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,662
You three look like
you're doing great too!

237
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:04,358
Looks like three good
friends who obviously...

238
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:07,483
...don't need the help
of another good friend!

239
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,129
This is Smarty Pants.

240
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,954
She was mine when I was your age.

241
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:15,358
And now I want to give her to you!

242
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,640
Uh... She's... great!

243
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,197
Yeah... Great.

244
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,403
I really like her... mane?

245
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:29,922
She even comes with
her own notebook and quill.

246
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:33,216
For when you want to pretend
she's doing her homework.

247
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:37,018
That's, um... great.

248
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,707
Yeah... Great.

249
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:44,518
I really like her... mane?

250
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,037
I just hope the fact that
there are three of you...

251
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:49,798
...and only one of her
doesn't become a problem.

252
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,215
I'd hate to cause a rift
between such good friends!

253
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,126
So who wants to play with her first?

254
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:59,057
Uh... You should play
with her first, Sweetie Belle.

255
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:01,414
You know, cause you
like her mane so much.

256
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:03,138
Nononononono.

257
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:06,449
I think Scootaloo should
get to play with her first.

258
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,606
I'd love to, but, um...
You take her, Apple Bloom.

259
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:13,166
Applejack says it's important to share.

260
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:16,715
I got to think of something.
Thinkthinkthink, Twilight, think!

261
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,530
That's it!

262
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:21,692
Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants.

263
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:24,322
And you're going to like her
more than anything.

264
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:34,603
I want it.

265
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:36,536
I need it.

266
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,798
I really like her mane!

267
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:44,268
The "want it, need it" spell.
Works every time.

268
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:46,736
Okay, okay. Let's break it up.

269
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,275
I think you can all see that
there is an important lesson...

270
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:50,743
...to be learned here about...

271
00:15:52,273 --> 00:15:54,825
Come on, girls. We're all friends here, right?

272
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:56,564
Don't you think you have to share?

273
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:58,640
No way!

274
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:07,620
Big McIntosh! Thank goodness!

275
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:10,561
You gotta help me get that
doll away from those girls.

276
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:12,477
Eeyup.

277
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,250
Thank you so much. Now if
you could just give her to me...

278
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:25,136
Nnnope.

279
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:27,516
Oh no!

280
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,508
What's all the commotion about?

281
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:35,100
They're fighting over that doll!

282
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:38,031
That incredible, amazing doll!

283
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,773
Can't get a clear shot...

284
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:48,744
Give me!

285
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:54,457
Nnnope.

286
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,840
Oh, what have I done?!

287
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:05,754
Y'all hear that?

288
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:12,304
What in the name of all things
oats 'n apples is goin' on here?

289
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:22,447
-DON'T LOOK AT IT!
-Don't look at what?

290
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:23,935
My Smarty Pants doll.

291
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:27,025
I enchanted her and now
everypony is fighting over her.

292
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,909
Why would you enchant your doll?

293
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,289
Oh, I had to do something!

294
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,491
I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia.

295
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:36,851
I thought if I couldn't find
a problem, I'd make a problem.

296
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:38,782
The day is almost over!

297
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,585
Not almost.

298
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:48,753
Twilight Sparkle!

299
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:53,522
Whoa, Nelly.

300
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,686
Meet me in the library.

301
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,899
Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit...

302
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:35,434
...I'll be in magic kindergarten
back in Canterlot.

303
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:40,071
-Magic kindergarten?
-Canterlot?

304
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:43,411
We're never gonna see Twilight again!

305
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:45,802
What are we gonna do, y'all?

306
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:48,551
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

307
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:52,810
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

308
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,418
What? I really mean it this time.

309
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:05,051
But... But... I'm supposed to send you
a letter about friendship every week.

310
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,589
I missed the deadline.

311
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,275
I'm a bad student. I'm tardy!

312
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,972
You are a wonderful student, Twilight.

313
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,781
I don't have to get a letter
every week to know that.

314
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:17,197
Really?

315
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:20,534
WAIT!

316
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,858
You can't punish her!

317
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,255
It wasn't her fault!

318
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:24,466
I'm listening.

319
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:27,206
Please, your highness.
We all saw that Twilight was upset.

320
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,362
But we thought that the thing
she was worrying about...

321
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:31,235
...wasn't worth worrying about.

322
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,129
So when she ran out all worked up...

323
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,373
...not a single one of us
tried to stop her.

324
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,923
As Twilight's good friends,
we should have taken...

325
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:40,596
...her feelings seriously
and been there for her.

326
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,409
Please don't take her away from us...

327
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,217
...just because we were
too insensitive to help her.

328
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,010
Looks like you all learned
a pretty valuable lesson today.

329
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,256
Very well. I'll forget Twilight's
punishment on one condition.

330
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:03,005
From this day forth
I would like you all...

331
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:06,163
...to report to me your findings
on the magic of friendship.

332
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,214
When and only when you happen to discover them.

333
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,220
Princess Celestia! Wait!

334
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,242
How did you know I was in trouble?

335
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,864
Your friend Spike made me aware...

336
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:21,243
...that you were letting
your fears get the best of you.

337
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:24,311
I commend him for taking
your feelings seriously.

338
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:28,189
Now, if you will all excuse me,
I must return to Canterlot.

339
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:30,635
I'm expecting some mail.

340
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,211
Y'all heard the princess.
Spike, take a letter.

341
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:47,256
"Dear Princess Celestia.
We're writin' to you..."

342
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:50,178
"...because today we all learned
a little somethin' about friendship."

343
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:53,374
"We learned that you should take
your friends' worries seriously."

344
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,414
"Even if you don't think that
she has anything to worry about."

345
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:59,658
"And that you shouldn't let
your worries turn a small problem..."

346
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,919
"...into an enormously huge
entire-town-in-total-chaos..."

347
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,639
"...Princess-has-to-come-
-and-save-the-day problem."

348
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,476
"Signed, your loyal subjects."

349
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,839
"PS. Obviously Spike did not
have to learn a lesson..."

350
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,234
"...because he is the best, most
awesome friend a pony could ask for."

351
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:19,623
"Unlike everypony else,
he took things seriously. And..."

352
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,466
Uh... Yeah.

353
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:25,050
I'll just, um...

354
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:36,601
