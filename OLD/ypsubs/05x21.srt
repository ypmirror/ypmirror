1
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:11,150
Fuzzy Legs? Do you think you
could secure those windows?

2
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:15,955
And you'll alert me
if anything scary

3
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:17,155
comes close to
the cottage?

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,250
Oh, who am I kidding?

5
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:22,220
When something scary comes
close to the cottage.

6
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,822
Please tell me my
hiding place is ready.

7
00:00:28,177 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, look, you've filled
it with everything I need

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,111
to survive this awful night.

9
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:36,444
Thank you. Thank you all!

10
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,155
Now I don't have to
step a hoof outside

11
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:41,088
until this whole
thing is over.

12
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,711
Oh, no! You don't
have any carrots?

13
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,088
Do we have any other fresh
veggies you may enjoy?

14
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:52,800
Or maybe some hay?

15
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,400
But that means I'll
need to go out...

16
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,755
...ON NIGHTMARE NIGHT?

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:27,022

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,133
Fluttershy?

23
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,800
What are you doing
out and about?

24
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:20,177
It's Nightmare Night, remember?

25
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,000
How could I forget?

26
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,244
Oh, I don't suppose
I could borrow

27
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,888
a few pieces of
hay from you.

28
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,511
I forgot to stock
up on food for Angel

29
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,644
and you do seem to
have quite a lot.

30
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:34,644
We need it for the Apple
Family Haunted Maze.

31
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,520
The scariest maze
that there ever was.

32
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:41,333
Who knows what
lurks inside?

33
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,890
Oh, I'm sure I don't.

34
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,844
Is that a mummified pony
that just leaped out at you?

35
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,900
I don't know, is it?

36
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:52,370
And what's that crunching
sound beneath your hooves?

37
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:56,711
Maybe it's the bones of ponies
that didn't make it out alive!

38
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:58,410
B-b-b-bones?

39
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:02,777
Are those peeled grapes or
a thousand slimy eyeballs

40
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:04,800
starin' at you from
beyond the grave?

41
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:07,210
Please tell me
they're grapes.

42
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,232
Oh, I'll never
tell.

43
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,177
I wonder what got
stuck in her craw?

44
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,288
Twilight?

45
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:43,488
You think it's scary now.
Just wait until it's done.

46
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,590
That's OK. I'll take
your word for it.

47
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:53,977
Hey, wait a minute!
It's Nightmare Night

48
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:56,444
and you're here and not
holed up in your cottage!

49
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:58,488
Does this mean what
I think it means?

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,177
That I foolishly forgot to
stock up on food for Angel

51
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:02,755
and had to go out
to get him something

52
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,666
but got spooked in
town so I came here

53
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,311
hoping Twilight had some
lettuce I could give him?

54
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,072
Oh. I thought
maybe you'd decided

55
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,000
to come out with us tonight.

56
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:14,280
Goodness, no! I couldn't be
out tonight. I just couldn't.

57
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,928
Technically speaking, you
already are out right now.

58
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,496
Oh. I guess that is true.

59
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:23,728
So what if you stayed out a
little longer with your friends?

60
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:25,472
I know they'd be super excited.

61
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:26,992
You think so?

62
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:29,408
You would make them SO
happy if you joined in.

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,784
They wouldn't
believe their eyes.

64
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:33,280
Come on, Fluttershy,
what do you say?

65
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:42,464
And then it
got very, very quiet

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,288
and suddenly they
realized

67
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,600
the BALLOONS HAD
NEVER BEEN INFLATED!

68
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:57,376
Did I ever tell you about the
night the mannequin came to life

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,792
and haunted all the costumes?

70
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:00,864
What happened?

71
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:02,688
I just told you, darling.

72
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,976
A mannequin came to life and
haunted all the costumes.

73
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:07,264
Hi, everypony.

74
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:11,488
Fluttershy? What are you
doing here? Is everything okay?

75
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:15,168
Everything is fine. In
fact, it's more than fine.

76
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:19,232
I've decided to join you in your
Nightmare Night festivities.

77
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:24,080
Seriously? You?
Out? Tonight?

78
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:28,176
Every Nightmare Night I
shut myself in my cottage

79
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:30,016
and refuse to come
out until morning.

80
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:32,064
But it's just like when
I was afraid to sing

81
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,200
in front of anypony.

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,920
If I hadn't given it a try,

83
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,872
I never would've found
out how much I enjoy it.

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,670
And we'd have missed out
on how great you sound.

85
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:43,248
Fluttershy with us
on Nightmare Night?

86
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:45,680
Why that's positively
the most wonderful news

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,340
I've heard in ages!

88
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,776
You can get dressed up
in a costume with us

89
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,184
and play Nightmare
Night games with us

90
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,832
and eat candy apples with us!

91
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:54,928
Don't forget the best part.

92
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,008
Goin' through my
family's corn maze.

93
00:05:58,048 --> 00:05:59,750
Oh, right. The maze.

94
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:02,448
Only if you're up for it.

95
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:07,088
I am! I am ready to
take on Nightmare Night!

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,760
AAAHHH!

97
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:14,970
Just practicing.

98
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:34,272
Mummy? No. Headless Pony?
No. Vampire Fruit Bat.

99
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,336
Ugh, definitely no.

100
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,752
You see, Fluttershy, the
beauty of Nightmare Night

101
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:43,424
is that you don't have to
dress up as something scary.

102
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:47,730
Ooh. Yes.

103
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,904
This one will look
gorgeous on you.

104
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,368
Period costumes are
all the rage this year.

105
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:55,110
What? No good?

106
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,056
What if we encounter
something terrifying

107
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:58,272
and need to get
away quickly?

108
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:02,096
All those layers could slow me
down, or worse, make me trip!

109
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:04,620
I never
considered that.

110
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:05,856
Never Fear!

111
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:12,448
Oooh, now this is a real
stunner! I call it "Masquerade!"

112
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,784
Just a simple black
dress underneath

113
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:17,660
but with this ornately
decorated mask!

114
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:18,976
A mask?

115
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:21,216
No?

116
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:24,400
They can just be so
difficult to see out of.

117
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,784
Yes, but this one has eyeholes.

118
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,032
What about being able to
see what's to the left

119
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,136
or right of me?

120
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,672
I suppose your vision
would be somewhat obscured.

121
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,072
It's your first Nightmare
Night out and about

122
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,750
and we do want you
to be comfortable.

123
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,850
What if I just
wear the dress?

124
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:45,296
Oh. Sure, dear.
That's fine.

125
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,760
It's so plain,
it's frightening.

126
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:53,904
Oh, my, look at all of you!
My costumes fit you to a T!

127
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,280
Hoo-ee we're gonna
have the best time!

128
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,540
Hey, Fluttershy,
where's your costume?

129
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:03,792
I'm wearing it.

130
00:08:06,464 --> 00:08:09,008
I get it! You're a robber
escaping into the night!

131
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,616
You're a NINJA escaping
into the night!

132
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,720
YOU'RE BLACK LICORICE
escaping into the night!

133
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,912
Close. I'm going to a masquerade
ball. Without the mask.

134
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:24,672
Oh, that's great!
Isn't it great?

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,656
Oh, yeah.
Great costume.
So creative!

136
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:36,896
I figured I'd save the really
scary games for next year

137
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:38,210
when Fluttershy's
more used to it.

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,728
Round and round and round you
go where you stop nopony knows!

139
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:47,696
OK, GO!

140
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,912
Good luck beating
THAT, Fluttershy!

141
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:59,584
Well, um. It's just
that if I'm blindfolded

142
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,408
and somepony were to
leap out in front of me,

143
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,936
I'd never have the
chance to defend myself.

144
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,504
That's fine, darling.

145
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,112
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

146
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,808
We're just glad
you're here.

147
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,344
We don't have to
finish that game;

148
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,280
I have another one I KNOW you'll
love! Bobbing for apples!

149
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:22,032
Fluttershy, what's wrong?

150
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,672
It's just that, um,
what happens if,

151
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:26,190
when my head is deep
down in the water,

152
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,176
some kind of scary
monster appears?

153
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:30,784
How would I even hear to
know I was under attack?

154
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,296
Time for candy!

155
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,070
It is?

156
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:37,616
I made candy bags!

157
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:40,096
Each bag has been made
with each of YOU in mind,

158
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:42,672
complete with each of
your favorite candies!

159
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,024
Awesome!

160
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:50,576
Here. Take it. Take it!
What are you waiting for?

161
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,432
Well, it's just...

162
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,232
what if when I'm eating one
of these chewy taffies,

163
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:58,336
my mouth becomes glued shut and
I can't scream for help?

164
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,112
Oh, goodness. We've only
just started to celebrate

165
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:09,270
Nightmare Night together

166
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:12,032
and I'm already taking all
the fun out of it, aren't I?

167
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,610
You're not taking
out ALL the fun.

168
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,664
Just like, 90 per--

169
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:19,610
--some of it.

170
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:21,344
I really want to do this.

171
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:25,440
But there's just so many things
that terrify me about tonight,

172
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,384
I couldn't possibly predict
what might upset me.

173
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:35,230
Unless... YOU were the
one doing the scaring!

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,776
HER scaring US?

175
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,560
Oh, you're being serious.

176
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,810
The thing you hate
is being scared,

177
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:51,136
but if YOU'RE the one
doing the scaring then...

178
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,368
....then I can help
you all have fun,

179
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:57,020
and I can still be a
part of Nightmare Night!

180
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,216
So you like that idea?

181
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:00,690
I think I do!

182
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:02,448
And I don't want to
get ahead of myself,

183
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
but I think I have the PERFECT
idea for how I'm going to do it!

184
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,720
Really? This is so exciting!

185
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:12,176
Meet me at my
cottage in an hour.

186
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:15,120
I'm excited to see
everypony soon!

187
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:32,190
<i>Welcome</i>
<i> to Fluttershy's tea party!</i>

188
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:34,528
Did she just
say tea party?

189
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:38,256
It sounds like it's
a scary tea party?

190
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:41,936
<i>Have a seat.</i>

191
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:49,200
<i> Don't be scared of</i>
<i> what awaits you!</i>

192
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:52,800
<i> Go on. Pass the sugar.</i>

193
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,976
<i>Oh, no! There is none!</i>

194
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:01,180
<i>You're a terrible host!</i>

195
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,180
<i> Rarity, put your coat on!</i>

196
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,176
Why would I do that?

197
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:12,000
<i>You need to cover up because no</i>
<i>one has complimented your dress!</i>

198
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:17,200
<i>Pinkie Pie, look to your left</i>
<i>and ask your best friend</i>

199
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,730
<i>to pass the cucumber sandwiches!</i>

200
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:24,128
Huh? I can't!
There's nopony there!

201
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:29,140
<i> That's right. Because she</i>
<i> didn't care to show up!</i>

202
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,352
What?

203
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,310
<i> A friend who didn't</i>
<i> come through!</i>

204
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:35,408
<i>That must scare you to the core!</i>

205
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,904
<i> Quick, everypony,</i>
<i> look behind you!</i>

206
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:40,576
Uh, what are those?

207
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:45,360
<i> They're unplanned guests!</i>
<i> Your worst nightmare!</i>

208
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:47,680
<i> You don't have</i>
<i> enough food for them!</i>

209
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:53,130
<i> Oh, no! There's a tiny</i>
<i> kitten that needs a home!</i>

210
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:55,680
<i> But you are</i>
<i> over-scheduled right now.</i>

211
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:57,792
<i> You don't have time to help!</i>

212
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:02,960
<i> I said, you don't</i>
<i> have time to help!</i>

213
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:07,808
<i>This should appear to scare you!</i>

214
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:14,448
Why don't you look terrified?
You showed up to a party

215
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,656
and everypony was extremely
disappointed in you.

216
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,328
Can you imagine
anything more upsetting?

217
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,000
It was a really
good try, darling

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,504
but the scares at
Nightmare Night

219
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,680
are of an entirely
different nature.

220
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,100
It was really
creative, though.

221
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,456
I never would have
thought of... all this.

222
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:37,916
Oh, I'm just not cut out for
this. Just go on without me.

223
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:40,368
Oh, no, we
couldn't possibly.

224
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:44,320
You have to. This is the night
you look forward to all year.

225
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,864
We could...stay here?

226
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,400
It's OK. I really want
you all to have fun.

227
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,120
This is how I spend
every Nightmare Night!

228
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:56,592
Please go, I'll be fine.

229
00:13:57,872 --> 00:14:00,000
It's funny; I actually
thought she had an idea

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
for something really
scary for a second there!

231
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,416
She definitely
tried her hardest!

232
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:09,110
I did try my hardest.

233
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:14,720
Or maybe not.

234
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,824
I suppose I could have gone
with something a bit scarier.

235
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,480
You're right. I've
been taking baby steps.

236
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:25,072
I think it's time
for grown up ones.

237
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:29,200
I don't suppose you have any
ideas how I could do that?

238
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,560
Everypony's lining up for the
corn maze, y'all. Let's go!

239
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,464
Oh, yeah! I can't believe
we're finally doing this!

240
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,280
It's a good thing
Fluttershy isn't here

241
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,112
because she would NEVER
be able to handle this!

242
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,256
AGH!

243
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:12,940
Boo...yup.

244
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:23,792
What. Is. That. Sound?

245
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:28,208
It looks like...bones!

246
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:33,776
Looks like a bunch of dried
sticks painted white to me.

247
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:37,008
Hey, TRY to keep up the
illusion, would ya?

248
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:54,784
Agh! What was that?

249
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:58,690
Don't you know?

250
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:01,808
Uh, course I do.
It was uh...

251
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,536
Fluttershy had a point with
the layers on the dress.

252
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,450
AGH!

253
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:34,640
What is this? Is it a
tunnel? Where does it lead?

254
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:42,528
Which way are we
supposed to go now?

255
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,568
I don't know! I don't
know what's going on!

256
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:50,096
What do you mean? Didn't
you help plan this?

257
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,248
Oh, there's
Granny Smith.

258
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,576
Not that I was EVER
scared. Cause I wasn't.

259
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:01,136
I'm a pretty good
actress when I wanna be.

260
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,020
Granny?

261
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,233
Applejack, didn't you
know about any of this?

262
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,496
All right, I gotts admit I
didn't know about any of this.

263
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,824
But maybe they're just tryin' to
make it interestin' for me too!

264
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,272
I'm sure Granny Smith or
Big Mac is behind this.

265
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:26,540
Are those
peeled grapes?

266
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,528
Or eyeballs starin' at you from
beyond the grave.

267
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:34,960
Eyup.

268
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,320
That's what WE were
supposed to do!

269
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,220
I don't know why
we're down here!

270
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,120
This is really
scarin' me now!

271
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,792
How did that get down here??

272
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,216
RUN!

273
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:10,672
I can't see!

274
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,720
I can barely move!

275
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,632
It's like glue!

276
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,280
AGH!

277
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,384
Oh, my!

278
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:10,176
I'm so, so sorry,
can you ever forgive me?

279
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:12,310
FLUTTERSHY?

280
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:14,688
It was you the
whole time?

281
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:16,672
I can't believe it!

282
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,296
That. Was.

283
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,552
THE BEST THING EVER!

284
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:25,392
It was way more terrifying
than the most terrifying thing

285
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:26,800
I could have thought of!

286
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,336
You out-nightmared the scariest
part of the corn maze!

287
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:32,500
How did you do all this?

288
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:35,312
After you left, I realized
that I wasn't ready

289
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:36,768
to give up on Nightmare Night.

290
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:39,600
So I asked Granny Smith if I
could try to make the maze

291
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,610
even scarier for
my friends.

292
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,016
You came up with
all of this?

293
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:45,680
I had some help.

294
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:52,384
Angel was the scary figure
that kept scurrying after you

295
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:53,320
in the maze.

296
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,360
Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall

297
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,472
that made it difficult
for you to see and move.

298
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,920
And of course Hairy was the
especially scary monster.

299
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:10,700
Wow. That was inspired.

300
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,344
You have to do
this EVERY YEAR!

301
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:20,432
We could celebrate Nightmare
Night together every year.

302
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:24,080
But the truth is I
really don't want to.

303
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:26,080
You DON'T?

304
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,616
But you've done it.

305
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:30,928
You've found a way we can all
have a fabulous time together.

306
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:34,930
Yes, but I've also
realized something.

307
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:37,216
You all may love
Nightmare Night

308
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,960
and I may be good at being a
part of it, but it's no fun

309
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,456
for me to see my friends
feel like they're in danger,

310
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:45,232
even if I know they're not.

311
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,280
I really don't like it. It's
just not my cup of tea.

312
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:51,824
Spooky tea?

313
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:55,200
No. Just regular tea.

314
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:58,112
We do lots of fun
things together.

315
00:20:58,544 --> 00:21:01,120
But I'm afraid this just isn't
going to be one of them.

316
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:05,630
Actually, I'm not afraid;
I'm perfectly fine with it.

317
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:07,568
Then we are too.

318
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,847
I don't know why I doubted
myself for a second.

319
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:27,792
Now THIS is what I call a
perfect Nightmare Night.
