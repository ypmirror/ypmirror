[spit]

350
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,510
This is wonderful!

351
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,960
I am so proud of you two.

352
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,360
Thanks, Princess.

353
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,400
Though I would just
like to point out

354
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,560
that I was the first
to admit I was wrong.

355
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,230
That may be, but I promised
not to fight first.

356
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,500
That counts for more.

357
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,040
Oh, yeah?

358
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,240
[urgent chirping & chittering]

359
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,360
Oh, all right. We don't
have to speak animal

360
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,040
to know what y'all
are sayin'. Truce?

361
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,380
Truce.

362
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:27,690
♪♪

363
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,120
Hoo-wee, ain't that
a pretty sight!

364
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
Sure is.

365
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,560
The McColts are going to
help us rebuild our homes --

366
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,240
good ones this time.

367
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,800
And the Hooffields are going
to help us grow some crops.

368
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,200
Not pumpkins!

369
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,310
Thanks for teaching us that
friendship is so much better

370
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,580
than winning a silly argument.

371
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,240
Yay! I told you
we'd figure it out.

372
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,040
We did. And we didn't need my
friendship portfolio to do it.

373
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,000
We just needed each other.

374
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,160
[poof]

375
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,400
So what do you think
will happen next?

376
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
We've all been called
by the map now.

377
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,080
I'm sure we'll find
out when we get home.

378
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,810
What if it summons all six
of us to another place?

379
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,320
Or another pony we
weren't expecting? [gasp]

380
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,600
What if it wants us to solve
other kinds of problems like

381
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
quantum physics or why the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree?
