1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,653
Phew! Thanks
for helping me

2
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,289
get them so fresh
and clean, Twilight.

3
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,325
No problem!
Happy to do it.

4
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,293
You probably can't wait to
get back to your castle

5
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,462
and take your
own bath, huh?

6
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,132
Aren't there more animals
that need cleaning?

7
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:35,467
I think you and I are
the only ones left.

8
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,170
And I can't wait to get
the mud out of my mane!

9
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:43,970
Oh no! Angel
got dirty!

10
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:46,981
I'd better stay longer to
help give him a bath, too.

11
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:04,090
Regular Subtitles by YayPonies!
We have muffins!
http://main.yayponies.eu

12
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:31,372
Thank you ever so
much for staying

13
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:32,745
to give Angel a bath, too...

14
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,397
But um, I think
he's dry.

15
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,987
Goodness! It's
gotten late.

16
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:44,564
You really didn't
have to stay all day.

17
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,623
Not that we don't
appreciate it.

18
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:47,873
Isn't that right?

19
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,564
I for one am exhausted.

20
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,511
Plus, I really
need to rest up

21
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:03,873
for that big pancake
breakfast tomorrow!

22
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,707
And I'm sure you have to
get the castle ready--

23
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:11,061
No! The castle's...fine.

24
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:15,103
But maybe I'd better see if
Pinkie Pie needs help

25
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:16,244
with the pancakes!

26
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:25,002
Um...Angel?

27
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,532
These are delicious,
Pinkie Pie!

28
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:46,101
Thanks! Twilight spent all night
helping me pick the flavor.

29
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:47,667
I kept thinking we'd
found the right one,

30
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,987
but she insisted I
make even more to try.

31
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:51,528
And more. And more.

32
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:52,568
And more. And more. And more!

33
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:53,970
It was like she
never wanted to--

34
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:54,724
--leave?

35
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:56,126
Exactly!

36
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,016
Eventually we ran out of
time so we just went with

37
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:01,823
Everyberry Anychip Surprise.

38
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:05,675
The surprise is I lost a
measuring spoon in the batter.

39
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:08,783
Somepony's gonna get a
very special pancake.

40
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:10,753
Up all night, huh?

41
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:12,673
Is that why she's so...

42
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,690
uh... out of it?

43
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:20,227
Um, I don't mean to
sound unappreciative,

44
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,433
but has anypony else noticed
that Twilight's been

45
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,421
a little too helpful lately?

46
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:26,892
Now that you mention it,
she was lendin' a hoof

47
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:28,273
at Sweet Apple
Acres the other day

48
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:30,223
and stuck around
till near midnight.

49
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,473
Dug up fifty tree-plantin' holes
when all I needed was ten.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,496
She spent an entire
afternoon rearranging

51
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:40,513
a single gem drawer
at the boutique.

52
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,791
An entire afternoon!

53
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,117
You think that's weird?

54
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,107
She raced me, like, a hundred
times the other day

55
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:48,433
and lost every time.

56
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:49,776
She just kept going!

57
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:50,800
Best out of ten.

58
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:51,785
Best out of twenty.

59
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:52,997
Best out of a hundred!

60
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,966
I mean, I know hanging
out with me is awesome

61
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,480
but it was like she'd
rather keep losing than--

62
00:03:58,576 --> 00:03:59,347
--leave?

63
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:00,298
Yeah.

64
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:01,814
Who does that?

65
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,981
Somepony who's avoiding
something, that's who.

66
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:11,545
Soon as she wakes up,
we're gonna find out what.

67
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:15,886
I WIN!

68
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:18,303
I'm pancake!

69
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:19,915
I mean, awake!

70
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,080
Uh, Twilight, is there
something you want to tell us?

71
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:27,578
You know how much we
appreciate all you do for us,

72
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,132
and we simply adore
having you around.

73
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:33,760
But we worry you might be...

74
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,667
avoiding something else?

75
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:38,467
Oh, has it been
that obvious?

76
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:42,210
I've been...

77
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:43,671
The thing is...

78
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,418
I know it's silly but I...

79
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,496
I've been avoiding...this place.

80
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:53,145
Why in Equestria
would you want to avoid

81
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:55,002
such a gorgeous castle?

82
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:56,837
Yeah, this place
has everything!

83
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:59,772
Big tall ceilings that
make you feel tiny.

84
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,644
Shiny new floors that
are cold to the touch.

85
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,490
BRR!

86
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,448
And it even has long
empty hallways...

87
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:10,070
...hallways... hallways.

88
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:12,547
OK, I get it.

89
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:14,307
The castle is amazing.

90
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:15,650
But it just...

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,858
It doesn't feel like home.

92
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,216
Is that all?

93
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:25,562
Why you simply need
to decorate, darling.

94
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,343
Make this space your own!

95
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,145
It's just so daunting.

96
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:30,509
Look how big it is.

97
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,408
I don't even know
where to start.

98
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:35,848
You can start by letting
us do it for you!

99
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:38,707
We will make this the
castle of your dreams

100
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:40,770
while you go the
Ponyville spa

101
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:43,326
for some much needed
rest and relaxation.

102
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,294
I'm saying this
with love, but...

103
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,749
have you looked in
a mirror lately?

104
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,593
I've never seen you look this...

105
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:53,254
Frazzled?

106
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:56,766
Yes, that is absolutely the
word I was going to use.

107
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:01,705
I guess I do need a little
help, and so does my castle.

108
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,595
And I just know
you'll do a great job

109
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,793
because nopony knows
me better than you!

110
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,341
We'll make this place feel
cozier than hot cider

111
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,313
on a rainy day.

112
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,334
There's gonna be cider?

113
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,587
Uh...I mean, let's decorate!

114
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:18,522
Oh no, did I miss the pancakes?

115
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:22,303
I sleep like a baby under
that cold, cavernous ceiling.

116
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,981
Spike, I'm so
glad you're here!

117
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:26,117
Really?

118
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,492
Yes. You're taking
Twilight to the spa.

119
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:30,922
Great! I've been meaning
to get my claws done.

120
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:36,138
Oh. You mean now.

121
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:45,570

We did a great job.

158
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:28,972
Together!

159
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,724
Heh heh.

160
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:33,790
Yeah, that sure is something.
We sure did.
Together

161
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:40,732
Fluttershy, I love that you
brought so many animals.

162
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,981
Are these your trophies?

163
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:46,147
I prefer to think of them
as everypony's trophies.

164
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:48,833
But with my name permanently
etched onto them.

165
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,675
My my, Applejack.

166
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:54,934
Bringing the outdoors
inside, it's...earthy.

167
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
What a lovely touch.

168
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,012
Are these quilts vintage?

169
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:01,595
Nope. Just old.

170
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:05,069
Unlike your sparkly window
doohickeys, which are...

171
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,044
why, they're just swell.

172
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,336
No one said anything about
my hidden confetti cannons!

173
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:12,509
Oh right. They're hidden.

174
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:18,766
Hey guys, how do my claws
look? SWEET CELESTIA!

175
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,143
Oh! Spike! Are you and
Twilight done already?

176
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,368
Don't worry, I ordered her the
super-deluxe mane blowout.

177
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:26,307
She'll be a while.

178
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:28,686
Man, this place looks terrible!

179
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,856
Thank goodness somepony
said something.

180
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:35,911
It's pretty bad, right?

181
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:38,850
This place looks like a
mishmash of knickknacks.

182
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:41,814
Hmmm, I suppose it is
a little cluttered.

183
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,612
What are you guys talking about?

184
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:45,440
I think it looks super fun!

185
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,052
Whee!

186
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:52,004
Oh no!

187
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,035
Please don't do that.

188
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,894
If we could all just take a
deep breath and calm down...

189
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:01,242
No! That bunting is
embroidered by hoof!

190
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:03,254
Don't you move one more paw!

191
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:06,265
EVERYPONY STOP!

192
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,917
OK, now it's a mess.

193
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:16,404
What are we gonna do?

194
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,587
I don't know, but Twilight's
blowout won't take that long!

195
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:21,477
If she was avoiding
the castle before,

196
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:23,368
she'll never set
hoof in here now!

197
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:24,829
Come on, guys!

198
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:26,223
We've gotta do something!

199
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,882
Twilight's counting on us!

200
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:31,806
Spike, you've got to get back
to that spa and stall her!

201
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,218
Whatever you do, don't
let her come home!

202
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:35,448
Like forever?

203
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:36,560
But we live here.

204
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:37,701
Uh...yes.

205
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:39,456
Well uh, maybe you
could manage until...

206
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:40,865
...sunsetish?

207
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:44,854
Anything for you, Rarity!

208
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:49,330
OK, we all agree the castle
is too cluttered, right?

209
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:52,787
So why doesn't everypony take
one of their own decorations out

210
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:54,206
and we'll see how it looks?

211
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,574
Uh huh!

212
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,417
Spike, you're back!

213
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:00,880
How do I look?

214
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,098
Great!

215
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,658
And more importantly,
how does the castle look?

216
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:08,122
Great!

217
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,046
I can't wait to go
home and see it!

218
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,913
Great!

219
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,016
I mean, NO!

220
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:15,814
I mean, uh, I'm not
quite ready to go yet.

221
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,498
Why don't we have a massage?

222
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,831
I was really hoping to
get uh, this thingy!

223
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,341
The extra strength hot
stone deep tissue massage?

224
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:25,482
Yep.

225
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:28,193
I think I'll just have
a traditional massage,

226
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:30,113
but you go for it.

227
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,661
Did somepony order massages?

228
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,120
YEAH!

229
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:37,397
Let's DO this, little dragon!

230
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,307
Oh, I hate it when
he does that.

231
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:44,130
Come with me, Princess.

232
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:48,223
Come on, Rarity.

233
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,082
Everypony has taken
somethin' out except you.

234
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:52,656
I know!

235
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,075
I simply can't decide.

236
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,840
How about this?

237
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,406
No! Not that!

238
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,543
Anything but that!

239
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,844
How about these?

240
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:01,840
But those brighten
up the whole room!

241
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:03,410
They're my favorite accent!

242
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,473
Then let's lose the curtains.

243
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,829
The room wouldn't
need brightening

244
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:08,522
if they weren't
making it so dark!

245
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:09,490
Not them!

246
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:10,951
They're my favorite, too!

247
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:14,021
They can't all be
your favorite!

248
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,004
OK, I'm taking
down the portrait.

249
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:17,928
We already know
what we look like.

250
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,471
The room still looks a little
bit cluttered, doesn't it?

251
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,522
Perhaps I'll take
down a poster or two.

252
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,534
Only to be helpful, of course!

253
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:31,920
OK, everypony calm down.

254
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,488
I'm sure we can find a way
to remove the clutter...

255
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:35,385
together!

256
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,180
You're absolutely
right, dear.

257
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,602
Hey! Those are my
warmin' quilts!

258
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:42,673
Together!

259
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:48,762
Fluttershy, tell your birds to
stop pecking at my balloons!

260
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:51,393
I guess they must not like being
scared out of their wits

261
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:53,983
by exploding confetti
cannons or something.

262
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:56,088
But we can't get
rid of the cannons!

263
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:57,751
I don't remember
where I hid 'em!

264
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,421
Allow me to help you!

265
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,006
Oh no, I'll help you!

266
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:03,717
NOT IF I HELP YOU FIRST!

267
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:08,404
Ah. Great
suggestion, Spike.

268
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,166
I feel totally relaxed.

269
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:14,509
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow!

270
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:15,730
You wanna hop on?

271
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,696
Maybe I can get us
to the castle faster.

272
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:23,616
OW!

273
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,124
I mean, how...

274
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,741
nice is this day?

275
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:29,326
I was hoping we could
take the scenic way back.

276
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:30,610
I don't know.

277
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:31,802
Come on.

278
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,244
Walking is good for
post-massage circulation.

279
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:35,132
Really?

280
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:36,985
I've never heard
that theory.

281
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,955
I really miss this place, Spike.

282
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:45,587
We had so many wonderful
memories here.

283
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,858
We did, didn't we?

284
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:51,612
Oh Spike, I'm so sorry.

285
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:55,284
Of course losing the Golden Oak
Library was hard for you too.

286
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:57,802
I've got an idea!

287
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:00,088
Why don't we have the
girls add some things

288
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:02,488
to make the castle feel more
like your home as well?

289
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:03,435
Really?

290
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:04,631
Hop on!

291
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:10,880
Ow!

292
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:12,176
What are you doing?

293
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:15,461
I, um, I just thought
of what I want.

294
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,223
Oh. OK. What is it?

295
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,393
It's a...

296
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,593
Well, I want a...

297
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,240
it's - I kinda need a...

298
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:23,684
A bed.

299
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:27,317
I thought you said you sleep
like a baby in the castle.

300
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,454
Pfft! Everypony knows babies
are terrible sleepers.

301
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:31,381
Let's go!

302
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,402
There! Now nothing is
cluttering the castle!

303
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:38,618
You're right.

304
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:41,991
There is literally NOTHING
cluttering this castle!

305
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:44,113
What do we do now?

306
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:47,014
I hate to be the bearer
of more bad news,

307
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:48,606
but it's almost sunset.

308
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:49,978
If we don't figure
this out soon,

309
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,202
it's going to look like we
didn't lift a hoof to help her.

310
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:54,176
Why is this so hard?

311
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:55,806
We're Twilight's best friends.

312
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,524
This should be easy for us!

313
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,328
She said it herself: if
anypony should be able

314
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:03,077
to make her feel comfortable
in her new home, it's us.

315
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:04,997
If we can't do it...

316
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,692
...then Twilight will be
stuck living in a castle

317
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,564
that just makes her
feel sad...

318
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:14,270
...sad...sad.

319
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:17,077
Wow, Fluttershy, I
didn't know you could be

320
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,400
loud enough to echo.

321
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,880
What do we do?
What do we do?

322
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,404
If Twilight comes home
now she'll be like

323
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:29,431
"What did you guys do?"

324
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:30,976
And we'll have to
be like "NOTHING!"

325
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:32,968
And then she'll be like
"I was counting on you!

326
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:34,227
Some friends you are!"

327
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:35,827
and we'll be like "AAAHHH!"

328
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,968
Calm down, Pinkie.

329
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,034
We just need to figure
out what we did wrong

330
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,460
so we can make it right.

331
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:46,235
Well, I didn't do
anything wrong.

332
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,623
I did exactly what I would
do if this were my home.

333
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,591
But it's not your home;
it's Twilight's home!

334
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,597
Where she keeps all her
Rainbow Dash trophies?

335
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:55,684
Touché.

336
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,625
Maybe we're all a little guilty

337
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,345
of making ourselves feel at
home instead of Twilight.

338
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,747
Come on, y'all, we just need
to think about Twilight!

339
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,528
What was it she
loved about living

340
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,048
in the Golden Oak Library?

341
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:08,795
Oh, everything!

342
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:10,564
The books, the
smell of books,

343
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:13,073
the joy she felt from
organizing books.

344
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,456
Remember that time I crashed
into all those books

345
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,597
attempting my Sonic Rainboom
after you guys just cleaned up?

346
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:21,886
That was good times.

347
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:23,427
Yeah, for YOU, maybe.

348
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:24,770
Oh and Applejack,

349
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:27,418
remember when we were stuck
having a sleepover there?

350
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:30,071
That turned out
to be so much fun!

351
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:33,650
Remember the time it got
blown up to smithereens?

352
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,124
Wait, no. That
was the worst!

353
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:40,277
We had a lot of good
memories there, though.

354
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,178
That's what made the
Golden Oak Library home.

355
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,823
That's it!

356
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:49,983
How's that one?

357
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:50,837
Too soft?

358
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:51,827
Too hard?

359
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,141
Too lumpy?

360
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,393
Ummm...

361
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:58,892
Just right! I'll take it!

362
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:00,922
Oh, thank goodness.

363
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,913
I thought you'd never
find one you liked.

364
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,191
Let's find a salespony
and get out of here.

365
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,090
Sounds good to me!

366
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,444
I mean, uh...

367
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:12,084
Do you hear that?

368
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,997
Too squeaky.

369
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:16,303
Better keep looking.

370
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:22,004
Maybe my plan won't
work after all.

371
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,993
Of course it will,
darling! I can see it!

372
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,766
You and Fluttershy stay here.

373
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,052
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie
Pie, you come with me!

374
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:32,593
We're going shopping!

375
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:33,957
We'll meet back at the castle!

376
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:41,482
<i> ♪ It's not the things</i>
<i> that you gather round. ♪</i>

377
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:45,216
<i> ♪ It's not how much you own. ♪</i>

378
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:50,677

381
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:02,547

382
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:10,181
<i> ♪ So we make, so we make, so</i>
<i> we make this castle a HOME! ♪</i>

383
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,240
Hello? We're home!

384
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,412
Welcome home!

385
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:24,665
Oh. I, uh, love what you've
done with the place!

386
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:26,858
You did such a good job of...

387
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,945
preserving the integrity
of the original design.

388
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:31,692
Oh, come on!

389
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:33,444
It looks exactly the same!

390
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:36,067
Do you know how hard it was to
keep her from coming back here?

391
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,027
I never want to see another
dust ruffle as long as I live!

392
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:40,235
Wait.

393
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,000
Keep me from coming back here?

394
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,418
It took a teensy bit
longer than we thought.

395
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:49,667
What really makes home feel like
home isn't what it looks like,

396
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:51,928
it's the memories you
make when you're there.

397
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:54,947
So we made something that
celebrates the memories

398
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:57,317
we've made with you since
you moved to Ponyville.

399
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:07,538
The ornaments on the chandelier
are reminders of all the fun

400
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,534
we've had together.

401
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:11,452
That one shows your party at
the Golden Oak Library

402
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,968
welcoming you to Ponyville.

403
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:16,463
The time we shared donuts after
the Grand Galloping Gala.

404
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:19,667
We were hoping that being able
to look at your beautiful

405
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,943
old memories would inspire
you to make new ones.

406
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,621
And the best part of it is
it's made from the roots

407
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,947
of the Golden Oak Library.

408
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:29,082
So you'll never forget
where you came from.

409
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:35,461
It's exactly what
the castle needed.

410
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,663
And I am ready to make
new memories here!

411
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:43,381
Then let's start right now
with a new memory cake!

412
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,002
Seven Layer What's-That-Flavor
Mystery Surprise!

413
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:49,221
These might be chocolate chips

414
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:52,037
or they might be super
spicy black beans.

415
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,924
Let's go to the dining room!

416
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:55,267
It's a little sparse

417
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,456
but at least there's a
table and chairs.

418
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,349
Whoa! What
happened in here?

419
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,808
Last I checked this
place was empty!

420
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:04,804
I couldn't help myself.

421
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,225
It was just begging
for the personal touch.

422
00:21:07,524 --> 00:21:10,206
Truth be told, I
couldn't either.

423
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:13,301
Your kitchen might have some
rustic farm decor, Twilight.

424
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:15,991
And there may or may not be
some Daring Do posters

425
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:17,031
up in your library.

426
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:19,418
And some stuffed
animals in your bedroom.

427
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,058
What was that?

428
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,507
One of Pinkie Pie's
confetti cannons.

429
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:28,886
What! It's not my fault
I hid them so well!

430
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,174
Ah, Pinkie!
