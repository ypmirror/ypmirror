1
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,590
What?!

2
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,860
That was barely
worth the effort, Adagio.

3
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,110
I'm tired of fast food.
I need a meal.

4
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,530
The energy in this world
isn't the same as in Equestria.

5
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,330
We can only gain
so much power here.

6
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,660
Ugh, I wish we'd never
been banished to this awful place.

7
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,750
Really?
I love it here.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,800
For realsies? Because I think
this place is the worst.

9
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,010
I think you're the worst,
Sonata.

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,470
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think you're--

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,260
I'll tell you one thing--

12
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,010
being stuck here
with you two

13
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,640
isn't making this world
any more bearable.

14
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,500
Did you feel that?

15
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,880
Do you know what that is?

16
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,250
Uh-uh.

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,960
It's Equestrian magic.

18
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,300
But this world doesn't
have Equestrian magic.

19
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,760
It does now.

20
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,010
And we're going to use it
to make everyone

21
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,180
in this pathetic
little world adore us.

22
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,660
<i>We used to fight
with each other</i>

23
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,870
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,000
<i>That was before
we discovered</i>

25
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,330
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

26
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,420
<i>Back when your
friendship was real</i>

27
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,460
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,670
<i>Yeah, you just say
what you feel</i>

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,130
<i>And the music</i>

30
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,010
<i>Yeah, the music</i>

31
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,510
<i>Gets us to the top</i>

32
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,690
<i>As we learn how the rainbow</i>

33
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,980
<i>Rainbow Rocks!</i>

34
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,870
<i>You can pick up the bass</i>

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,870
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,200
<i>And you can play the guitar</i>

37
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,580
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

38
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,790
<i>You can bang on the drums</i>

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,670
<i>Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa</i>

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,880
<i>Or you can sing like a star</i>

41
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,630
<i>And the music</i>

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,010
<i>Yeah, the music</i>

43
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,640
<i>Gets us to the top</i>

44
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,060
<i>As we learn
how the rainbow</i>

45
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,270
<i>Rainbow Rocks!</i>

46
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,570
<i>As we learn
how the rainbow</i>

47
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,990
<i>Rainbow Rocks!</i>

48
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,160
- Want some help?
- Uh, no, thanks. We're good.

49
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,490
Oh, okay.

50
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,120
Sunset Shimmer,
over here!

51
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,640
I had no idea
the whole school would be here.

52
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,940
Quite the eye-catching
advertisement if I do say so myself.

53
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,690
And it smells like cake.

54
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,610
It does?

55
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,980
I used frosting
instead of paste.

56
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,860
Uh, Fluttershy, you've got
a little something... uh...

57
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,240
- Did I get it?
- Not exactly.

58
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,040
Good afternoon,
students.

59
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,210
I just wanted
to tell you all

60
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,790
how pleased I am
that so many of you

61
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,090
are going to participate
in the first ever

62
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,760
Canterlot High School
musical showcase.

63
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,850
This is a wonderful
opportunity

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,560
to raise money for all
our after-school programs

65
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,060
here at CHS.

66
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,440
So keep working on
those signs and posters.

67
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,150
I think it's going to be

68
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,190
one of the most exciting
events we've had at CHS

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,070
since the Fall Formal.

70
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,080
I am never gonna
live that down.

71
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,540
You were pretty bad
at the Fall Formal.

72
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,090
A demon. I turned into
a raging she-demon.

73
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,970
And tried to turn everyone here
into teenage zombies

74
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,640
for your own
personal army.

75
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,060
Oh, darling, you have us.

76
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,430
And we've forgiven you
for your past-- ahem-- boo-boos.

77
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,980
To be honest, I'd say
the whole experience

78
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,480
brought everyone at Canterlot High
closer than ever before.

79
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,280
One, two, three.

80
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,400
<i>There</i> was a time
we were apart

81
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,450
<i>But that's behind us now</i>

82
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,990
<i>See how we've made
a brand-new start</i>

83
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,870
<i>And the future's
looking up</i>

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
<i>Oh, oh</i>

85
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,750
<i>And when you
walk these halls</i>

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,120
<i>You feel it everywhere</i>

87
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,080
<i>Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever</i>

88
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,460
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

89
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,210
<i>We are all together</i>

90
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,840
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

91
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,720
<i>Now it's better than ever</i>

92
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,430
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

93
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,140
<i>You can feel it</i>

94
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,270
<i>We are back and I'm so glad
that we're better</i>

95
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,270
<i>Better than ever</i>

96
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,440
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

97
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,770
<i>Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever</i>

98
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,860
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

99
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,160
<i>There was a time we couldn't see
past the differences</i>

100
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,580
<i>That separated you and me
and it left us on our own</i>

101
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,500
<i>But now you walk these halls</i>

102
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,540
<i>And friends are everywhere</i>

103
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,670
<i>Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever</i>

104
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,000
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

105
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,800
<i>We are all together</i>

106
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,420
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,010
<i>Now it's better than ever</i>

108
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,600
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

109
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,180
<i>Now that we are back on track</i>

110
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,150
<i>Yes, I'm so glad that we're better</i>

111
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,110
<i>Better than ever</i>

112
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,900
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

113
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,280
<i>Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever</i>

114
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,280
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

115
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,450
<i>Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever</i>

116
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,660
<i>Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh</i>

117
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,740
<i>Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever.</i>

118
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,880
I still can't believe
that happens when we play.

119
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,790
Ooh, I've got to look
into some new accessories.

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,170
Something that looks good
in a longer ponytail.

121
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,090
Ooh, maybe some
clip-on earrings

122
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,430
for when I get those
adorable pony ears.

123
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,930
I just wonder
why it happens.

124
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,760
Princess Twilight took
her crown back to Equestria.

125
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,350
Shouldn't that mean she took
all the magic back with her?

126
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,850
Who cares why it happens?

127
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,440
It makes my band
totally awesome.

128
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,440
Oh, your band?

129
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,070
Duh, it was my idea
to start the Rainbooms

130
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,740
so we could be
in the showcase.

131
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,570
Plus, I'm the lead singer
and guitarist.

132
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,910
Heard you outside.

133
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,790
You guys are sounding
really tight.

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,750
Uh, we're getting there.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,250
Rarity's still coming in a little late
on the second verse

136
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,380
and Applejack's bass solo
could use a little work.

137
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,800
They'll get it together
in time for the showcase.

138
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,050
Uh, I don't suppose

139
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,760
any of our friends
from out of town might come?

140
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,970
It being a special
charity event and all.

141
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,350
Sorry, Flash, I don't think
Twilight's gonna be back

142
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,350
at Canterlot
High any time soon.

143
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,730
Oh, yeah. Okay.

144
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,230
Just, you know,
thought I'd ask.

145
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,240
Uh, keep on rocking it.

146
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,490
Well, someone is quite
the smitten kitten.

147
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,450
Ooh, sorry.

148
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,450
I always forget you and Flash
used to be an item.

149
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,710
It's okay.

150
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,920
Flash is a great guy and all,

151
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,000
but I never really
liked him liked him.

152
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,540
I was just using him
to become more popular.

153
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
The old me
really was just awful, wasn't she?

154
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,090
Yup.

155
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,180
But the important thing
is that you've turned yourself around.

156
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,680
Thanks, Applejack.

157
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,600
But I'm not sure everyone else
at CHS feels the same way.

158
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,730
Sunset Shimmer,
please report to the main foyer.

159
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,320
Gotta run. I volunteered to show some
new students around the school.

160
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,650
Thought it would be good
for them to get to know the new me

161
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,280
before they heard
all the stuff about the old me.

162
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,030
We've still got a few minutes
before lunch starts,

163
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,700
what do you say we do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be"?

164
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,790
Um, Rainbow Dash,

165
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,130
I was wondering if we maybe
could play the song I wrote.

166
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,090
We'll get to it.

167
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,050
Oh, okay.

168
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,670
Hi. Are you the girls
I'm supposed to show around?

169
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,930
We are.

170
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,470
Canterlot High
is a great school.

171
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,810
You're really
gonna love it.

172
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,390
Oh, yes.

173
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,770
We really sense there's something
magical about this place.

174
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,240
That's the science lab.

175
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,070
Computer lab
is in there.

176
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,530
Ooh, we're having a big
musical showcase this weekend.

177
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,080
The whole school is
pretty much rallying around it.

178
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,750
A musical showcase?

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm sure since you're new,
Principal Celestia

180
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,630
will let you sign up
if you're interested.

181
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,920
We have been known to sing
from time to time.

182
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,090
Hello?
We sing, like, all the time.

183
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,510
It's how we get people
to do what we want.

184
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,470
What did I say?

185
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,350
What you meant to say

186
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,480
was that being in
a musical showcase

187
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,400
sounds like a great way
to meet other students.

188
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,940
Oh, yeah.

189
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,690
What she said,
I meant to say.

190
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,940
That's what I meant...
to say.

191
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,200
And what you would have said
if you weren't the worst.

192
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,740
You are.

193
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,490
You have to excuse them.
They're idiots.

194
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,790
Hmmph.

195
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,250
Those are pretty.

196
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,130
Where did you--

197
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,390
Sorry. These pendants
mean an awful lot to us.

198
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,180
We'd just hate for anything
to happen to them.

199
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,610
- So how was the tour?
- I don't know.

200
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,660
I mean, these girls,
they were--

201
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,620
there was something off
about them.

202
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,500
Like off like this?

203
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,000
Or off like this?

204
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,500
Or-- ooh, like--

205
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,290
Maybe we should
just let her tell us?

206
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,000
That's just it.
I can't put my finger on it.

207
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,510
They just acted sort of
strange around me.

208
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,050
Maybe someone already
talked to them.

209
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,760
Told them about what I did.

210
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,890
So much for making
a good first impression.

211
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,230
Uh-huh.

212
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,100
Ooh, that's
probably not it.

213
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,480
This is it, girls.

214
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,280
The moment we've
been waiting for.

215
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,860
Lunch?

216
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,530
The chance to get our
true Equestrian magic back.

217
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,990
Oh, right.

218
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,660
Our voices are
just strong enough

219
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,210
to make them want
something so badly,

220
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,620
they'll fight to get it.

221
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,710
So we're just gonna do
what we always do?

222
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,510
Stir up some trouble
and then feed off the negative energy?

223
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,510
Some plan, Adagio.

224
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,090
It won't be the same
as the times before.

225
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,430
There is Equestrian
magic here.

226
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,220
Their negative energy
will give us the power we need

227
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,520
to get this entire world
to do our bidding.

228
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,860
But we can get lunch after,
though, right?

229
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,520
It's Taco Tuesday.

230
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,150
- Just follow my lead.
- Or my lead.

231
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,360
My lead.

232
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,640
<i>We heard you want
to get together</i>

233
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,350
<i>We heard you want
to rock this school</i>

234
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,440
<i>We've got something
that is better</i>

235
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,740
<i>Something that changes
all the rules</i>

236
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,790
<i>Why pretend
we're all the same?</i>

237
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,790
<i>When some of us
shine brighter</i>

238
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,340
<i>Here's a chance
to find your flame</i>

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,380
<i>Are you a loser or a fighter?</i>

240
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,890
<i>Me and you,
you and me</i>

241
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,640
<i>Why don't we see
who is better?</i>

242
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,100
<i>We don't have to be
one and the same thing</i>

243
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,690
<i>Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?</i>

244
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,110
<i>Are you afraid of failing
the audition?</i>

245
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,240
<i>You're a star
and you should know it</i>

246
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,370
<i>Now you rise above the rest</i>

247
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,670
<i>It doesn't matter who you hurt</i>

248
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,340
<i>If you're just proving
you're the best</i>

249
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,890
<i>Battle,
you want to win it</i>

250
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,970
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

251
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,680
<i>Battle of the bands</i>

252
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,520
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

253
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,520
<i>We'll go all in it</i>

254
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,570
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

255
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,070
<i>Battle, battle</i>

256
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,860
<i>Battle of the bands...</i>

257
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,650
I can beat you.

258
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,990
<i>- Battle...
- Ha! You wish.</i>

259
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,410
<i>- Battle...
- I so want this.</i>

260
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
<i>- Battle...
- Not if I get it first.</i>

261
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,370
<i>Me and you,
you and me</i>

262
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,170
<i>Why don't we see
who is better?</i>

263
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,590
<i>We don't have to be
one and the same thing</i>

264
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,470
<i>Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?</i>

265
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,850
<i>I'm going out there,
winning the audition</i>

266
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,560
<i>Battle</i>

267
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,850
<i>We want to win it</i>

268
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,020
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

269
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,690
<i>Battle of the bands</i>

270
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,190
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

271
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,400
<i>We'll go all in it</i>

272
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,400
<i>Let's have a battle</i>

273
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,950
<i>Battle, battle</i>

274
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,660
<i>Battle of the bands.</i>

275
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,500
Oh, they're
that kind of off.

276
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,590
Those three are definitely
in possession

277
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,090
of some kind
of dark magic.

278
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,550
How else could you explain
what happened back there?

279
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,680
Don't worry, y'all. We let Principal
Celestia know all about this

280
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,020
and those girls will be kicked
to the curb in no time.

281
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,190
Last thing she needs
is another CHS event

282
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,770
almost ruined by some
power-crazed lunatic.

283
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,230
Uh, no offense.

284
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,440
None taken.

285
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,740
Dark magic?

286
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,450
I find that
very hard to believe.

287
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,330
Those girls came into
my office earlier

288
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,330
and were
absolutely delightful.

289
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,540
Perhaps Sunset Shimmer

290
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,130
is just eager to make someone
else out to be a bad element

291
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,460
so that her actions at the Fall Formal
will become old news.

292
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,590
I could see why
you might think that, but--

293
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,260
That's not what's happening.

294
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,140
We saw all of this go down
in the cafeteria, too.

295
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,560
Yes, but isn't your band

296
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,680
supposed to be part of
the musical showcase?

297
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,980
Yes.

298
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,850
Perhaps you're all
just worried

299
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,690
that the Dazzlings
will steal your spotlight.

300
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,690
The Dazzlings?

301
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,690
It's the name
of their musical group.

302
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,570
That's why they came by
my office earlier.

303
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,030
To sign up for the showcase.

304
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,450
Even sang a little song
to Vice Principal Luna and I.

305
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,200
- They did?
- Yes.

306
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,250
And we think having
a battle of the bands

307
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,040
instead is
a marvelous idea.

308
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,010
I can't believe they got
to Principal Celestia

309
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,010
and Vice Principal Luna, too.

310
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,600
They've gotten
to everybody.

311
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,930
- Not everybody.
- Pinkie Pie's right.

312
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,730
We were there when
the Dazzlings were singing

313
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,350
and we weren't affected.

314
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,270
It was like we were
protected somehow.

315
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,190
So let's take them down.

316
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,230
It's not like we haven't tangled
with dark magic before

317
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,860
and totally whupped
its sorry butt.

318
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,070
Uh, no offense.

319
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,530
None taken.

320
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,950
Again.

321
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,910
But that was when
Twilight was here.

322
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,250
There may be some kind
of magic inside us,

323
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,330
but it only comes out
when we play music.

324
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,670
I sure don't know
how to use it

325
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,510
to "whup anybody's butt."

326
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,010
if only we could get
a message to Twilight.

327
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,010
Maybe she could tell us
how to break the spell

328
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,800
the Dazzlings have cast
on our friends.

329
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,720
Well, that's not gonna happen.

330
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,140
The portal's closed.

331
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,190
And I get the feeling

332
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,940
they don't exactly have
cell phones where she's from.

333
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,730
I may have an idea

334
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,110
how we can get in touch
with Princess Twilight.

335
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,710
When I was Princess Celestia's
student back in Equestria,

336
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,670
she gave me this.

337
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,800
Even after I abandoned my studies,
I held on to it.

338
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,840
Deep down, I guess I knew
I was making a big mistake

339
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,550
and I still wanted a way
to reach out to her.

340
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,850
Maybe it still works.

341
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,970
That's a book, darling.

342
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,060
What do you mean
maybe still works?

343
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,480
It used to be that
if I wrote something here,

344
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,270
it would appear in the pages of a book
back in Princess Celestia's library.

345
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
I get a message to her,

346
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,030
then she can get a message
to Princess Twilight.

347
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,280
So what are you waiting for?
Get to writing.

348
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,210
Huh.

349
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,250
Been a long time since
I've written these words.

350
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,340
"Dear Princess Celestia."

351
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,370
Excuse me, Princess,

352
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,080
where do you want all these
books from Princess Celestia?

353
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,500
The library.
Third door on the left.

354
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,340
Even this one that's glowing
and vibrating?

355
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,100
What is it, Twilight?

356
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,150
It looks like a message
to Princess Celestia

357
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,860
from my friends
at Canterlot High.

358
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,530
How is that even possible?

359
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,860
I have no idea,

360
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,950
but it sounds like
they need my help.

361
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,200
The way Sunset Shimmer
described them,

362
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,410
I think these new girls
sound an awful lot like

363
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,960
the Sirens.

364
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,040
Not the Sirens!

365
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,380
I don't actually know
what that is.

366
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,930
The Sirens were three beautiful
but dangerous creatures

367
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,100
who had the power to charm
ponies with their music.

368
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,890
But to maintain this power,

369
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,180
they had to feed on the negativity
and distrust of others.

370
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,980
The more of this
negative energy they consumed,

371
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,310
the stronger
their voices became

372
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,030
and the farther they could
spread their dark magic.

373
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,740
I don't think I like
this story very much.

374
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,990
If the Sirens had their way,

375
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,620
they would have divided
and conquered all of Equestria.

376
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,160
But a certain Star Swirl the Bearded
wasn't having it.

377
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,170
Rumor has it he found a way
to banish them to another world.

378
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,380
One where he believed
their magic power would be lost.

379
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,590
That world must have been the one
where my Canterlot High friends live.

380
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,760
But Star Swirl must have
sent them there ages ago.

381
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,850
How come they're
just surfacing now?

382
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
I don't know,
but if my hunch is right

383
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,730
and it is the Sirens
who have come to Canterlot High,

384
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,600
this spell they've cast
is just the beginning.

385
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,820
My friends need me.
I have to get back to them.

386
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,860
I hate to burst your bubble,
Twilight,

387
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,360
but the connection between
their world and Equestria

388
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,610
will still be totally cut off
for a super long time.

389
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,280
Okay, first of all, if there was bubble
blowing going on,

390
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,990
why wasn't I told about it?

391
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,370
And secondly, if the connection
is totally cut off,

392
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,040
how was Sunset Shimmer
able to get a message to Twilight?

393
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,920
Pinkie, you're a genius.

394
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,800
Yeah, I get that a lot.

395
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,840
Now about those bubbles.

396
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,230
...and the interval between
the two points is defined

397
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,400
as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the separation

398
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,030
between the points along
three spatial dimensions.

399
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,200
- Say what now?
- Duh.

400
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,000
She's gonna take the magic
in here and put it in there.

401
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,670
That'll make the portal open up
so that whenever she wants to,

402
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,500
she can go
from here to there.

403
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,710
There to here.
Here-there.

404
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,260
- There to here. Here to there. There--
- We get the idea.

405
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,640
Now to see
if it actually works.

406
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,860
Ooh.

407
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,970
Ahh.

408
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,180
Don't suppose we could
join you this time around?

409
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,770
Better not.

410
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,730
It could make things
pretty confusing if Canterlot High

411
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,230
all of a sudden had
two of all of you.

412
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,900
But I still get to go, right?

413
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,070
There isn't another one of me
at Canterlot High.

414
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,700
And you never know when you might
need your trusty assistant.

415
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,780
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes!

416
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,620
We won't be gone long.

417
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,120
And don't forget
to dress well.

418
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,300
Ready, Spike?

419
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,800
Ready.

420
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm starting to think
she's not coming.

421
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,370
Twilight!

422
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,670
Ooh. I'm back.

423
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,970
Oh, Twilight.

424
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,970
I've got some bad news
about those new girls.

425
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,810
Oh, I do hate that you had
to return at a time of crisis.

426
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,270
We have so much
catching up to do.

427
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,030
For starters, a certain blue-haired
guitar player was just asking about you.

428
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,200
Flash Sentry
was asking about me?

429
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,910
Ahem.
Isn't that nice?

430
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,580
Perhaps you could give us just the
slightest bit of gossip from your world?

431
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,540
She's got
an official title now.

432
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,130
The Princess of Friendship.

433
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,840
Wow, that's
really impressive.

434
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,180
Guess you really were
Princess Celestia's prize pupil.

435
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,300
She's even got
her own castle.

436
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,850
A castle?!

437
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,600
You have your own castle?!

438
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,980
Uh, ahem.

439
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,850
Oh, lovely.

440
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,190
What's new here?

441
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,480
I mean, besides your school
becoming the target

442
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,070
of dangerous magical creatures
from Equestria.

443
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,860
Yeah,
so that isn't exactly

444
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,240
the only strange thing
that's happened since you left.

445
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,200
...and I'm so glad
that we're better...

446
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,620
Pretty sweet, huh?

447
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,160
It happens to all of us
when we play.

448
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,210
Hmm. My crown
was returned to Equestria,

449
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,380
but some of its magic must have
remained here at Canterlot High.

450
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,130
Now that we're
all back together,

451
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,090
we can use that magic
on the Sirens.

452
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,300
Just like when we were able to use it
on Sunset Shimmer

453
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,310
when she turned into
that horrifyingly awful winged monster.

454
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,680
No offense.

455
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,060
None taken.

456
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,850
I'm used to it.

457
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,060
They'll never even know
what hit 'em.

458
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,780
We've got nothing to worry about
now that Twilight's back.

459
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,780
Oh, I'm pretty sure I could
find something to worry about.

460
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,830
But it won't be the Sirens.

461
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,700
The sooner we do this,
the better.

462
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,960
Any idea where
the Dazzlings might be?

463
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,590
Ahh.

464
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,250
There's a big party tonight
for all the bands

465
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,800
who signed up
to be in the showcase.

466
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,800
That would include
the Dazzlings.

467
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,180
Looks like we've got
a party to crash.

468
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,160
I'm gonna get more punch.

469
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,040
Twilight?

470
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,290
Oh, bumped into--

471
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,000
always doing...

472
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,000
What are you doing here?

473
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,420
You came back for
the big competition, right?

474
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,340
Something like that.

475
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,970
Not that there's going to be
any real competition.

476
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,260
No one here wants this
as bad as my band does.

477
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,360
<i>Can you excuse me
for just a minute?</i>

478
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,340
Oh, no. No one's mingling.

479
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,300
It's like there's some kind
of underlying tension

480
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,640
that could bubble
to the surface at any minute.

481
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,180
It's the fruit punch,
isn't it?

482
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,310
I knew I used
too much grape juice.

483
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,180
It's not the fruit punch,
it's us.

484
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,650
But the punch is awful, too.

485
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,060
What do you know
about good fruit punch?

486
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,480
More than you.

487
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,690
- Do not.
- Do, too.

488
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,360
This is just
the kickoff party, girls.

489
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,490
Imagine what a tizzy
they'll be in

490
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,990
by the time the battle of
the bands starts.

491
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,040
There isn't going to be
a battle of the bands.

492
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,910
We're gonna make sure
of that.

493
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,750
All right, girls,
let's do this.

494
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,590
Friendship is magic.

495
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,810
Uh, weren't there rainbows
and lasers and stuff last time?

496
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,570
I don't understand.

497
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,110
We're all together again.

498
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,610
Why isn't this working?

499
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,580
You, uh, really
need to go ahead

500
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,790
and do that whole
"magic of friendship" thing now.

501
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,410
I'm trying, Spike.

502
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,580
I thought the six of us standing
together against the Sirens

503
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,920
would bring out the magic
we needed to defeat them.

504
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,920
That's what happened before.

505
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,590
Talk about throwing down
the gauntlet.

506
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,140
This group is obviously
serious about winning.

507
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,050
A little cocky,
though, aren't they?

508
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,430
Claiming there won't
really be a battle.

509
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,730
Seems they think they've already got
this thing all locked up.

510
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,190
Not if the great and powerful
Trixie has anything to do with it.

511
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,860
Whatever, Trixie.

512
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,610
We're the best band at CHS.

513
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,490
No. The Crusaders
are gonna win.

514
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,220
I think we may have found
what we're looking for.

515
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,600
Or rather,
it found us.

516
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,230
Magic.
Don't you see?

517
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,150
Everyone else has fallen
under our spell.

518
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,190
But not these girls.

519
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,070
These girls are special.

520
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,070
It doesn't make any sense.

521
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,870
I should have been able
to create the spark

522
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,330
that would help us
break their spell.

523
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
That's how it worked before.

524
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,330
But to defeat me, you drew magic
from the crown I was wearing.

525
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,840
The Sirens' magic
comes from their music...

526
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,970
so maybe you have to use
the same kind of magic to defeat them.

527
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,880
Or maybe not.

528
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,680
- No, I think you're onto something.
- Really?

529
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,810
It's when you play music
that you transform now, right?

530
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,520
Yup. Ears, tails,
the whole shebang.

531
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,360
So maybe the way to use that magic
to defeat the Sirens

532
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,440
is by playing a musical
counterspell.

533
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,440
- You mean like a song?
- Uh-huh.

534
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,450
And in order to free everyone
who's been exposed to the Sirens spell,

535
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,280
we'll need them all
to hear it.

536
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,030
Hmm.

537
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,160
The band competition.

538
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,870
That's the next time
we can be certain

539
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,250
everyone will be in the same place
at the same time.

540
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,710
Guess the Rainbooms are
the band to beat.

541
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,710
And I believe,
you, Twilight,

542
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,050
just became the Rainbooms'
newest member.

543
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,010
So what do you
want to play?

544
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,310
Triangle?
Sousaphone?

545
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,350
<i>Theremin?</i>

546
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,900
So magical.

547
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,740
I might take
a little too long

548
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,780
to learn how to play
something with these.

549
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,240
I'll just sing.

550
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,240
Like as in lead singer?

551
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,740
'Cause that's
usually my gig.

552
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,410
This being
my band and all.

553
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,160
It's our band.

554
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,080
And of course
as lead singer.

555
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,380
She's the one with the magical knowhow
to help us pull this thing off.

556
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,420
Okay, yeah, that's cool.

557
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,260
I'll just use this
as a chance

558
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,840
to hone my already insanely
good lead guitar skills.

559
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,800
It's only temporary.

560
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,010
And we don't have to win
the battle of the bands.

561
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,100
We just have to perform during
the first round of the competition.

562
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,810
So let's get to learning
that musical counterspell.

563
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,860
Well, that's just it.
I don't know any.

564
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,280
But I'm sure I could
figure out how to write one.

565
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,660
Totally. Twilight can write a spell
like it's nobody's business.

566
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,780
That's pretty much how she got to become
a princess in Equestria.

567
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,290
Technically,
I helped finish a spell.

568
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,500
And there was a little more
to it than that, Spike.

569
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,620
Yeah, whatever.

570
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,040
I've got this.

571
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,460
Come on.

572
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,250
Where are you going?

573
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,710
Well,
last time we were here,

574
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,630
Spike and I spent the night
in the library.

575
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,340
Are you crazy?

576
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,390
We're besties now.

577
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,350
Slumber party at my house.

578
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,520
Status update--
okey dokey, Loki.

579
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,830
Hey.
I was about to beat you.

580
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,160
I doubt it.

581
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,000
So, Twilight, how's that
counterspell coming?

582
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,090
Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great.

583
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,760
Thanks for letting me
use your notebook, Fluttershy.

584
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,180
I really like the song
you wrote for the Rainbooms.

585
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,840
Thanks.

586
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,640
Hopefully one day,
we'll get a chance to play it.

587
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,720
Hey!

588
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,100
Twilight, I think I speak
for all of us when I say

589
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,360
I don't know what we would've done
if you hadn't come back to help us.

590
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,690
Uh-huh.

591
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,190
Pizza's here.

592
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,210
Don't you want any pizza?

593
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,380
No, that's not gonna work.

594
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,090
Hey, Twilight.
You're up late.

595
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,930
Just looking over
the counterspell.

596
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,060
We only get one shot at this.
It has to be perfect.

597
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,680
We really are lucky
you're here.

598
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,940
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

599
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,360
Who could possibly need
this much whipped cream?

600
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,070
It must be nice
to have everyone

601
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,860
always looking to you
for answers to their problems

602
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,820
instead of waiting for you
to cause a problem.

603
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,200
Just because everyone
expects something from you

604
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,120
doesn't mean it's guaranteed
to happen.

605
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,620
But that doesn't stop them
from expecting it.

606
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,120
Which only make things harder

607
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,330
because the last thing
you want to do is...

608
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,000
Let everybody down.

609
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,840
Boulder was hungry.

610
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,350
I still can't get over the fact that
she's related to Pinkie Pie.

611
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,810
You and me both.

612
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,480
I better get some sleep.

613
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,110
Good luck with
the counterspell.

614
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,610
Not that you'll need it.

615
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,530
This must be nothing
compared to the stuff

616
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:54,120
you're expected to deal with
as a princess in Equestria.

617
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,750
Sunset Shimmer...

618
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,540
Never mind.
It's not important.

619
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,970
No, I have to be able
to do this.

620
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,880
I have to.

621
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,760
<i>Hey, hey, listen</i>

622
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,480
<i>We've got a message
for you</i>

623
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,690
<i>We're not all alike</i>

624
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,650
<i>But our friendship is true</i>

625
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,030
<i>Yeah, we're really different</i>

626
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,990
<i>But we still get along</i>

627
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,030
<i>So, hey, he)'</i>

628
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,370
<i>Listen to our song</i>

629
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,250
<i>You may think you're in control</i>

630
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,050
<i>But we're here
to prove you wrong</i>

631
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,590
<i>With the friendship
of our music</i>

632
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,260
<i>With the power of our song</i>

633
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,430
<i>Gonna stomp our feet,
clap our hands</i>

634
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,350
<i>With our magical friendship</i>

635
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,690
<i>Gonna stop your evil plan.</i>

636
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,160
Eh, that sounded
way better

637
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,910
than the last five times
you played it.

638
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,120
Eenope.

639
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,620
I think it's pretty obvious

640
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,710
what's going wrong
with this counterspell.

641
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,460
You're turning what should be the chorus
into a five-minute guitar solo?

642
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,050
I have to pick up
the slack somehow.

643
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,630
Are you guys even trying?

644
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,090
I'm trying.

645
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,140
It's fine.
I'll be fine.

646
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,890
One more time from the top.

647
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,140
Or perhaps we could take
a short break--

648
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,100
try on some of the wardrobe choices
I put together.

649
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,520
I'm particularly fond
of this one.

650
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,940
Of course we could always go
with something a bit more modern.

651
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,570
We're trying to
save our school here.

652
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,120
Enough with the costumes.

653
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,780
You can never have
enough costumes.

654
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,120
She just wants
to make things fun.

655
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,790
Isn't that what being
in a band is supposed to be?

656
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,630
You don't have time
for any of this.

657
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,300
You're supposed to check in at the
battle of the bands in 15 minutes.

658
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,470
Oh, no!

659
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,550
But-- but it's not ready.

660
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,260
If we play the counterspell
in the first round and it doesn't work,

661
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,800
the Sirens will know
what we're up to

662
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,680
and make sure we don't
get a chance to play it again.

663
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,690
Then we'll have to
buy ourselves some time

664
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,150
so you can keep
working on it.

665
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,270
And how do you propose
we do that?

666
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,070
We compete in the battle
of the bands for real.

667
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,570
I take over lead vocals again
and we stay alive until the finals.

668
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,320
We unleash
the counterspell then.

669
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,950
You'll have figured it out
by the finals, right?

670
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,740
Of course she will.

671
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,290
Twilight Sparkle's never met
a problem she couldn't solve.

672
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,170
- Right, Twilight?
- Right.

673
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,250
Then let's go win us
a battle of the bands.

674
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,680
Welcome to the first ever

675
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,100
Canterlot High School
battle of the bands.

676
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,020
I believe I speak
for everyone when I say

677
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,230
it is by far
the greatest thing

678
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,860
we have ever done
here at this school.

679
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,870
We are so glad
our three newest students

680
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,870
encouraged us
to turn this event

681
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,160
into something exciting.

682
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,830
But as this is now
a competition,

683
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
we can only choose
one winner.

684
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,710
Who is it going to be?

685
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,720
You feel that, girls?

686
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,270
Our true power
is being restored.

687
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,110
And that's before

688
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,610
we've tapped into
the strongest magic here.

689
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,740
But the Rainblossoms--
or whatever they're called--

690
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,700
aren't under our spell.

691
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,830
How exactly are we supposed
to get to their magic?

692
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,040
The Rainbooms
are just as capable

693
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,210
of falling apart
as anyone else.

694
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,880
They just need a little push
in the wrong direction.

695
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,210
I have a feeling
everyone here

696
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,260
is going to be lining up
to give them a shove.

697
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,730
Oh, yeah. Snips and Snails
in the house, yo.

698
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,520
<i>They call me M.C. Snips
and it ain't no lie</i>

699
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,860
<i>My favorite food
is like pumpkin pie</i>

700
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,400
<i>I 'm D.J. Snazzy Snails,
I like whales</i>

701
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,940
<i>When I go to the beach,
I always bring my pail</i>

702
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,700
<i>Everybody knows
my favorite color is orange</i>

703
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,830
<i>My rhymes are so fly,
they're better than, um...</i>

704
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,450
<i>Than an orange, yo</i>

705
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,620
<i>- Yeah, represent
- Yeah</i>

706
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,630
What do we--
what do we do now?

707
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,630
Get off the stage,
I'd like to leave right now.

708
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,260
Bam. That just happened.

709
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,390
- Yeah, we out.
- Snip and Snails outta here.

710
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,020
Please do not
drop the microphones.

711
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,520
- Yeah.
- Bam.

712
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:21,280
In your face, Rainbooms.

713
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,490
At least we know one group

714
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,950
who won't stand in the way
of us getting to the finals.

715
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,820
Let's get ready to rock.

716
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,450
Wait,
where's Rarity?

717
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,250
Ooh, here. I'm here.

718
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,420
We will be performing
in front of an audience.

719
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,430
I'm not going to wear
something fabulous? Hmm.

720
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,690
Remember, we have to be
good enough to make it through,

721
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,860
but not so good we let the Sirens
see the magic within us.

722
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,150
They could realize we plan
to use it against them.

723
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,320
Got it.
Be cool enough to win,

724
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,610
but not so cool
that we end up showing off

725
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,820
the whole ears and tails
and rainbows thing.

726
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:11,580
So about 20% less cool.

727
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,660
- <i>One, two.
- We just got the day</i>

728
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,670
<i>To get ready</i>

729
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,590
<i>And there's only
so much time to lose</i>

730
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,460
<i>Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party</i>

731
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,380
<i>So let's think of
something fun to do</i>

732
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:31,180
<i>We don't know
what's gonna happen</i>

733
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,640
<i>We just know
it's gonna feel right</i>

734
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,230
<i>All our friends are here</i>

735
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,150
<i>And it's time
to ignite the lights</i>

736
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,030
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

737
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,820
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail</i>

738
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:51,990
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

739
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,790
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail...</i>

740
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,290
<i>So what you didn't get it
right the first time?</i>

741
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,580
Boring.

742
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,590
<i>Laugh it off,
no one said it is a crime</i>

743
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,380
<i>Do your thing,
you know you're an original</i>

744
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,550
<i>Your ideas are so funny
that they're criminal</i>

745
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,300
<i>Ohh, ahh</i>

746
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,850
<i>We've just got the day
to get ready</i>

747
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,770
<i>And there's only
so much time to lose</i>

748
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,520
<i>Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party</i>

749
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,150
<i>So let's think of
something fun to do</i>

750
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,990
Awesome.

751
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,570
<i>We don't know</i>

752
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,490
<i>What's gonna happen</i>

753
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,870
<i>We just know
it's gonna feel right</i>

754
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,660
<i>All our friends are here</i>

755
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:39,420
<i>And it's time
to ignite the lights</i>

756
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,210
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

757
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,380
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail</i>

758
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,050
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

759
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,010
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail</i>

760
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,430
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

761
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,230
<i>Shake your tail, shake your tail</i>

762
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,400
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight</i>

763
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,570
<i>Shake your tail,
shake your tail</i>

764
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,820
<i>Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight.</i>

765
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,330
Ruined.

766
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,290
Absolutely ruined.

767
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,290
Rarity, were you trying
to make us lose out there?

768
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,340
What--
this was not my fault.

769
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,800
This was an act of sabotage.

770
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,220
Yeah, well, whoever did this
couldn't have done this

771
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,800
if you didn't insist
on dressing like-- like this.

772
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,430
We need to sound good.

773
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,180
Is there some reason
that concept seems to escape you?

774
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,310
And what was
with the confetti, Pinkie Pie?

775
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,560
How am I supposed to shred
if there's paper stuck in my frets?

776
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,320
- It was pretty distracting.
- Ah!

777
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,030
Says the girl who was running
from a light the whole time.

778
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,400
A light!

779
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,280
You still sounded
much better

780
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,780
than most
of the other bands.

781
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,580
I'm sure you'll make it
to the next round.

782
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,830
But it won't matter if you don't
have that counterspell ready.

783
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,710
You all find a place to practice
where the Sirens can't hear you,

784
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,210
I'll keep an eye on things
around here.

785
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,470
I don't think we should
use a classroom.

786
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,480
We really need to stop bumping
into each other like this.

787
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,310
Uh, you guys
hear something?

788
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,900
- Uh-uh.
- Uh, no.

789
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,610
I said we have to stop--

790
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,150
There it is again.
So annoying.

791
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,240
Why are you
acting like this?

792
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,030
I thought
we were friends.

793
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,330
Yeah, and then you decide
to come back here

794
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,370
just so you can beat me
in the battle of the bands.

795
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,210
I want this, Twilight,
and you're trying to take it from me.

796
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,250
Some friend.

797
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
That's not why--

798
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,170
Come on, Twilight.
We've got things to do.

799
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,010
You really think
you're gonna help them?

800
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,720
I bet you have no idea
what you're even doing.

801
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:59,930
Tears already?

802
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,060
This is only
the first round.

803
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,020
The next band to take the stage

804
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,400
will be Trixie
and the Illusions.

805
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:13,400
Better head back.
We're supposed to go on after Trixie.

806
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,370
You're never gonna
get away with this.

807
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,750
Why, because you didn't?

808
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,670
Oh, we know all about you,
Sunset Shimmer.

809
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,210
You've got quite
the reputation at Canterlot High.

810
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,880
I've changed.
I'm in a much better place now.

811
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,880
Waiting in the wings
while your friends have all the fun?

812
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,220
Oh, yes,
you girls are so tight.

813
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:42,560
And yet they didn't ask you
to be in the band?

814
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,230
Probably afraid no one
would want to see them play

815
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,400
if she was
in the group.

816
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,730
Too bad.

817
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,190
So sad.

818
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,860
If it's any consolation,

819
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,320
no one is going to
remember you at all

820
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,360
by the time
we're done.

821
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,250
Remember, girls,
we want to save the good stuff

822
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,000
for when our full power
has been restored.

823
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,760
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

824
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,920
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

825
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,300
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

826
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,470
<i>Now that you're
under our spell</i>

827
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,140
<i>Blindsided by the beat</i>

828
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,390
<i>Clapping your hands,
stomping your feet</i>

829
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,600
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

830
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,650
<i>Oh</i>

831
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,270
<i>Now you've fallen
under our spell</i>

832
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,610
<i>Oh</i>

833
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,280
<i>We've got the music,
makes you move it</i>

834
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,490
<i>Got the song
that makes you lose it</i>

835
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,950
<i>We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"</i>

836
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,080
<i>Put your hands up
to the sky</i>

837
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,370
<i>We've got the music,
makes you move it</i>

838
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,790
<i>Got the song
that makes you lose it</i>

839
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,130
<i>We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"</i>

840
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,300
<i>Put your hands up
to the sky</i>

841
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,300
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

842
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,670
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

843
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,840
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

844
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:03,140
<i>Now that you're
under our spell</i>

845
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,600
<i>Listen to the sound
of my voice</i>

846
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,430
<i>Oh</i>

847
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,350
<i>Soon you'll find
you don't have a choice</i>

848
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,100
<i>Oh</i>

849
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,980
<i>Captured in the web
of my song</i>

850
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:16,610
<i>Oh</i>

851
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,900
<i>Soon you'll all
be singing along</i>

852
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,410
<i>Oh</i>

853
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,240
<i>We've got the music,
makes you move it</i>

854
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,540
<i>Got the song
that makes you lose it</i>

855
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,910
<i>We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"</i>

856
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,170
<i>Put your hands up
to the sky</i>

857
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,630
<i>We've got the music,
makes you move it</i>

858
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,880
<i>Got the song
that makes you lose it</i>

859
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,090
<i>We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"</i>

860
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,470
<i>Put your hands up
to the sky</i>

861
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,300
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

862
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,680
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

863
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,850
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

864
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,310
<i>Now that you're
under our spell</i>

865
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,690
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

866
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,150
<i>You didn't know
that you fell</i>

867
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,190
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, whoa</i>

868
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,690
<i>Now that you're
under our spell.</i>

869
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,710
This is it, last round
and you're in the finals.

870
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,260
Unless you think the counterspell
is ready to be played now.

871
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,390
Don't worry, Twilight,
finals aren't until tonight.

872
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,800
We'll get in a little
more practice

873
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,430
before we're
supposed to hit the stage.

874
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,100
- We won't let you down.
- Yeah.

875
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,810
You won't let me down.

876
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,440
Um, I was just wondering,

877
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,770
we haven't played any
of my songs yet and--

878
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,150
It's the semifinals.

879
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,650
We've gotta do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be."

880
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,660
I don't know why I even asked.

881
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,570
<i>...got tricks
up my sleeve</i>

882
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:52,790
<i>See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.</i>

883
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:57,630
Oh! Fantastic.

884
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,180
You're never gonna top
that performance, "Raingoons."

885
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,760
You shouldn't
be allowed to

886
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,640
when you have such
a big advantage over the rest of us.

887
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,680
My superior guitar playing

888
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,980
and off-the-charts
awesome singing voice?

889
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,020
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

890
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,730
I mean her.

891
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,690
If you were really all that,
Rainbow Dash,

892
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,440
you wouldn't have needed
to bring in some magical ringer

893
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,900
to have half a chance.

894
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,860
Everyone's talking about it.

895
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,660
Ha! Please.

896
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,530
I could win this thing
as a solo act

897
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,330
and everybody knows it.

898
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,040
Sure, you could.

899
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,750
She's gone!

900
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,050
Oh, wait.
There she is.

901
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,930
Next up, the Rainbooms.

902
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,100
- Knock 'em dead, Rainbooms.
- I'll be here.

903
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,060
Just watching.

904
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:04,570
<i>- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
- Awesome as I wanna be</i>

905
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,780
<i>Hey, hey, he)',
hey, hey, hey</i>

906
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,410
<i>Awesome as I wanna be</i>

907
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,080
<i>First you see me
riding on a sonic boom</i>

908
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,750
<i>Got my guitar
shredding up my latest tune</i>

909
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,330
<i>There is nothing
you can do to beat me</i>

910
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,040
<i>I'm so good
that you can't defeat me</i>

911
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,920
<i>Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution</i>

912
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,760
<i>Watch out for me,
I'm awesome as I wanna be</i>

913
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,550
<i>Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution</i>

914
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,350
<i>Watch out for me,
I'm as awesome as I wanna be</i>

915
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,890
<i>Hey, hey, he)',
hey, hey, hey</i>

916
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,690
<i>Hey, hey, hey, he)',
hey, hey.</i>

917
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,840
Now that's the bad girl
we love to hate.

918
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,550
I knew she was still trouble.

919
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,550
The real Sunset Shimmer is back.

920
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,890
No, it isn't like that.

921
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,560
What was that?

922
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,180
You were showing them
your magic.

923
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,980
I didn't know
what else to do.

924
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,650
Close the curtains.
Unplug her amp.

925
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,520
Give us a chance to deal
with the situation.

926
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,740
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to help.

927
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,570
Yeah, well, you didn't.

928
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,660
None of this would've happened
if you weren't trying to show off.

929
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,070
As usual.

930
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,540
Good show, "Rainbrooms."

931
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,120
I especially like the part
where Sunset Shimmer,

932
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:41,000
in a fit of jealous rage,

933
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,460
knocked out Rainbow Dash
mid guitar solo.

934
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,920
It wasn't a fit
of jealous rage.

935
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,470
If you say so.

936
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,510
Ooh, looks like
they've already decided

937
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,310
who'll be moving on
to the finals.

938
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,640
I'm guessing it wasn't
too difficult a decision.

939
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,530
- Huh?
- What can we do?

940
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,110
There isn't gonna be another
opportunity for us to play.

941
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,870
And I had the most gorgeous
outfit for the finals.

942
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,950
Yup, 'cause that's
he real tragedy here, Rarity.

943
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,700
That you won't
get to play dress-up.

944
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
You know perfectly well
that is not what I meant.

945
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,960
You guys wanna
keep it down?

946
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,340
They're about to
announce who's moving on.

947
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,590
Who are you kidding?

948
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,800
You know it isn't
gonna be us.

949
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,260
The band that will be joining
the Dazzlings in tonight's finals...

950
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,390
the Rainbooms.

951
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,100
- What?!
- Huh?

952
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,430
Did they just say
"The Rainbooms"?

953
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,690
This isn't over.

954
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,690
Congratulations, girls.

955
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,690
You deserve it.

956
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,360
Seriously?
We didn't even finish our--

957
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,540
See you at tonight's
big show, Rainbooms.

958
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:03,000
We are really
looking forward to it.

959
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,580
Yeah, well,
not as much as we are.

960
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:10,460
This never should have been you,
Rainbooms.

961
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,690
This is a travesty.

962
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,690
A travesty!

963
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,270
It really is.

964
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,770
The Rainbooms don't deserve
to be in the finals.

965
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,860
Not when your band
was so much better in the semis.

966
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,200
And wanted it
so much more.

967
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,620
Alas, this is the way
it's going to be.

968
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,950
Dazzlings
versus Rainbooms.

969
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,450
Unless, of course, the Rainbooms
don't manage to make it to their set

970
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,710
were held up
for some reason.

971
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,830
Hmm?

972
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,680
Check one, two.
Testing. Testing.

973
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,350
Testing.

974
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,810
This doesn't
make any sense.

975
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,400
We were awful.

976
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,690
Doesn't anybody else
think it's strange

977
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,150
that we're the ones
that made it to the finals?

978
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,200
Very strange.

979
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,200
What are you doing here,
Trixie?

980
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,290
Pretty sure the losers are supposed
to be up there in the cheap seats.

981
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,710
The great and powerful Trixie

982
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,330
is the most talented girl
at Canterlot High.

983
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,210
It is I who deserve to be
in the finals.

984
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,880
And I will not be denied.

985
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,860
See you never.

986
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,610
Told you someone
would give them a shove.

987
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,030
She didn't shove them,
she pulled the lever.

988
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,910
Oh, go back to sleep,
Sonata.

989
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,420
<i>You better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve</i>

990
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:15,630
<i>And I captivate 'cause
I'm powerful and great</i>

991
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,760
<i>You'd better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve</i>

992
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:27,020
<i>See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great...</i>

993
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,610
Give it up, Rainbow Dash.

994
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,150
You've been trying at this for hours.
It's not gonna open.

995
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,570
Maybe it doesn't even matter
that we're trapped down here.

996
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,030
I don't think the counterspell
would've worked anyway.

997
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,910
'Course it would've worked,
Twilight.

998
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,910
Assuming a certain band member
didn't try to hog the spotlight

999
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,540
the whole time
we were trying to play it.

1000
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,750
Hey, if you want
to tell Twilight

1001
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,250
she's getting
a little too caught up

1002
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,960
trying to be the new leader of this
band,

1003
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,340
you don't have to be
all cryptic about it.

1004
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:03,340
She was talking about you,
Rainbow Dash.

1005
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:04,680
Me?!

1006
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,430
I'm just trying
to make sure my band

1007
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,390
rocks as hard
as it needs to.

1008
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,520
Our band!

1009
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,390
But why wasn't it working?

1010
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,900
I should know what to do.

1011
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,690
How can I not know
what to do?

1012
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,610
How could I
have failed like this?

1013
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,110
It might've been your idea
to start a band,

1014
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,860
but it's not just your band,
Rainbow Dash.

1015
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,990
I'm the one who writes
all the songs.

1016
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,410
I write songs.
You just never let us play any of them.

1017
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:31,290
I had the most perfect
outfits for us to wear.

1018
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,210
Again with the costumes.

1019
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,960
No one cares
what we're wearing.

1020
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,750
I care, Applejack.

1021
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,300
So sorry if I enjoy trying to make
a creative contribution to the band.

1022
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,930
Hey, anybody here
remember fun?!

1023
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,470
I'll give you a hint--

1024
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,890
it's the exact opposite
of being in the Rainbooms!

1025
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,890
I wish I never asked
any of you to be in my band.

1026
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:55,520
- I wish I never agreed to be in it!
- Me neither.

1027
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,490
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1028
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:14,500
<i>Better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve</i>

1029
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:20,710
<i>See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.</i>

1030
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,220
Try to top that.

1031
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,480
Oh, gosh,
I don't know if we can.

1032
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,360
Stop!
You have to stop!

1033
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:23,860
This is what
they've been after all along.

1034
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,610
They're feeding off
of the magic inside you.

1035
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,860
How can they
be using our magic?

1036
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,530
It's the magic
of friendship.

1037
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,290
Ever since you started
this band,

1038
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,410
you've been letting
little things get to you.

1039
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,580
I never said anything 'cause
I didn't feel like it was my place.

1040
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:43,250
Not when I was so new to this
whole friendship thing.

1041
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,550
I still have a lot to learn.

1042
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,590
But I do know that
if you don't work out

1043
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,090
even the smallest problems
right at the start,

1044
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,430
the magic of friendship
can be turned into something else.

1045
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,020
I can't believe
all this tension was happening

1046
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,270
right under my nose
and I didn't realize it.

1047
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,520
I'm supposed to be the one
with all the answers.

1048
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:05,440
And all I've done
since I got here is let you down.

1049
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,700
I don't think anyone
is supposed to have all the answers.

1050
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,280
But you can count
on your friends to help you find them.

1051
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,830
I think you already have.

1052
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,160
Come on, we need to
get out of here.

1053
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,380
Spike!

1054
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,470
Sorry I took so long.

1055
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,140
I had to find somebody who wasn't
under the Sirens' spell

1056
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:33,550
to help me get you out.

1057
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,430
Why isn't she
under their spell?

1058
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,980
Never takes off
her headphones.

1059
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,020
Come on, y'all.

1060
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,440
Time to prove we've still got the magic
of friendship inside us.

1061
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,440
And there's only
one way to do it.

1062
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,320
We're getting the band
back together?

1063
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:50,400
We're getting
our band back together.

1064
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:53,370
- Whee!
- Oh, which version of the counterspell

1065
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,740
are we going to play?

1066
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:57,040
I don't think it matters
what song we play

1067
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:00,410
as long as we play it
together as friends.

1068
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,790
I know just the song.

1069
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:05,380
Fluttershy's written
a really great one.

1070
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,590
We're about to
save the world here.

1071
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,760
Personally,
I think we should do it in style.

1072
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:14,800
- Rarity?
- I thought you'd never ask.

1073
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,610
<i>Welcome to the show</i>

1074
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:35,620
<i>We're here
to let you know</i>

1075
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:39,910
<i>Our time is now</i>

1076
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,120
<i>Your time is running out</i>

1077
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,210
How are we supposed
to play over them from up here?

1078
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,900
<i>Feel the wave of sound</i>

1079
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,520
<i>As it crashes down</i>

1080
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,780
<i>You can't turn away</i>

1081
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,610
<i>We'll make you wanna stay</i>

1082
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,570
<i>We will be adored</i>

1083
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,740
<i>Tell us that you want us</i>

1084
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:22,620
<i>We won't be ignored</i>

1085
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,870
<i>It's time for our reward</i>

1086
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,210
<i>Now you need us</i>

1087
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,880
<i>Come and meet us</i>

1088
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:34,880
<i>Nothing can stop us now</i>

1089
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:37,760
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

1090
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,180
<i>I've got the music in me</i>

1091
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:42,600
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

1092
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,020
<i>Don't need
to hear a crowd</i>

1093
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:49,980
<i>Cheering out my name</i>

1094
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:54,240
<i>I didn't come here
seeking infamy or fame</i>

1095
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,910
<i>The one and only thing</i>

1096
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,780
<i>That I am here to bring</i>

1097
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,780
<i>ls music,
is the music</i>

1098
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,250
<i>ls the music
in my soul</i>

1099
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,700
<i>Gonna break out</i>

1100
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,210
<i>Set myself free, yeah</i>

1101
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,090
<i>Let it all go, go</i>

1102
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,710
<i>Just let it be, yeah</i>

1103
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,340
<i>Find the music
in your heart</i>

1104
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,590
<i>Let the music
make you start</i>

1105
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,260
<i>To set yourself apart</i>

1106
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:26,270
So the Rainbooms want to turn this
into a real battle of the bands?

1107
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,140
Then let's battle.

1108
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,230
<i>What we have in store</i>

1109
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,940
<i>All we want and more</i>

1110
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:35,150
<i>We will break on through</i>

1111
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,490
<i>Now it's time
to finish you</i>

1112
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,820
<i>Oh, oh...</i>

1113
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,110
Sunset Shimmer,
we need you.

1114
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,460
<i>You're never gonna
bring me down</i>

1115
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,960
<i>You're never gonna
break this part of me</i>

1116
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:20,670
<i>My friends are here
to bring me around</i>

1117
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,340
<i>Not just singing
for popularity</i>

1118
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,470
<i>We're here
to let you know</i>

1119
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,140
<i>That we won't let it go</i>

1120
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:31,270
<i>Our music is a bomb
and it's about to blow</i>

1121
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,190
<i>And you can try to fight</i>

1122
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,980
<i>But we have got the light
of friendship on our side</i>

1123
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,030
<i>Got the music
in our hearts</i>

1124
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,610
<i>We're here to blow
this thing apart</i>

1125
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:48,620
<i>And together,
we will never</i>

1126
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,960
<i>Be afraid of the dark</i>

1127
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:55,580
<i>Here to sing our song
out loud</i>

1128
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:59,000
<i>Get you dancing
with the crowd</i>

1129
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:04,510
<i>As the music
of our friendship survives</i>

1130
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,300
<i>Survives</i>

1131
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:09,510
<i>Got the music
in our hearts</i>

1132
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,140
<i>We're here to blow
this thing apart</i>

1133
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:16,810
<i>And together,
we will never</i>

1134
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,360
<i>Be afraid of the dark</i>

1135
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:23,950
<i>Here to sing our song
out loud</i>

1136
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,320
<i>Get you dancing
with the crowd</i>

1137
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:32,620
<i>As the music
of our friendship survives</i>

1138
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:38,420
<i>Survives, survives</i>

1139
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,860
<i>We will be adored</i>

1140
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,860
<i>Tell us that you want us</i>

1141
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,280
<i>We won't be ignored</i>

1142
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:09,160
<i>It's time for our reward...</i>

1143
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,540
Guess that explains why these were
so special to them.

1144
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:20,880
Without those pendants and the magic
you brought here from Equestria,

1145
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,460
they're just three
harmless teenage girls.

1146
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:27,260
Rainbooms rule!
That was amazing.

1147
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,940
You may have vanquished
the Dazzlings,

1148
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:40,400
but you will never have the amazing
showstopping ability

1149
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,270
of the great
and powerful Trixie.

1150
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,200
She's gone!

1151
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,700
Oh, wait.
There she is.

1152
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:58,290
Trixie's okay.

1153
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:01,380
You know, Twilight is going back
to Equestria soon.

1154
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,040
The Rainbooms
could really use

1155
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:05,960
someone to help Fluttershy
on backup vocals.

1156
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:13,470
I also play guitar.

1157
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,020
We'll see.

1158
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,780
Sure wish
you could stay longer.

1159
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,620
Me, too, but I have
responsibilities

1160
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,700
in Equestria
that I have to get back to.

1161
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:38,870
Its citizens need me.

1162
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,210
But now I can go through the portal
whenever I need to.

1163
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:46,090
This isn't good-bye,
it's just good-bye till next time.

1164
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,010
- Ready?
- Ready.

1165
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,480
"Dear
Princess Twilight,

1166
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:07,150
missing you already
and hope you'll be back soon.

1167
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,650
Things are definitely looking up
for me here at Canterlot High,

1168
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:14,570
but I know I still have a lot
to learn about friendship.

1169
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,740
Hope you don't mind if I write to you
for advice when I need it.

1170
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,620
Your friend,
Sunset Shimmer."

1171
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:23,710
- You ready or what?
- Ready.

1172
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,130
One, two, three, four.

1173
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:39,180
<i>Once upon a time</i>

1174
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:43,520
<i>You came into my world
and made the stars align</i>

1175
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:48,150
<i>Now I can see the signs</i>

1176
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,240
<i>You pick me up
when I get down so I can shine</i>

1177
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:56,450
<i>Shine like rainbows</i>

1178
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:01,870
<i>Shine
like rainbows</i>

1179
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,540
<i>Friends,
you are in my life</i>

1180
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:10,630
<i>And you can count on me
to be there by your side</i>

1181
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,340
<i>And when the music
comes alive</i>

1182
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:18,720
<i>We sing our songs to
lift us up so we can shine</i>

1183
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:22,480
<i>And the sound
that we hear in our hearts</i>

1184
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:27,270
<i>Makes a crescendo</i>

1185
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,070
<i>And the light that ignites
in the dark</i>

1186
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,570
<i>It makes us all glow</i>

1187
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,910
<i>And shine like rainbows</i>

1188
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:45,420
<i>We shine like rainbows</i>

1189
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:49,290
<i>Together we stand</i>

1190
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:55,300
<i>As the rain
begins to fall</i>

1191
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:58,260
<i>And holding
our heads up high</i>

1192
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:02,390
<i>As the sun shines
through it all</i>

1193
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,480
<i>And the sound
that we hear in our hearts</i>

1194
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:11,270
<i>Makes a crescendo</i>

1195
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,610
<i>And the light
that ignites in the dark</i>

1196
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:19,820
<i>It makes us all glow</i>

1197
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:23,950
<i>And shine like rainbows</i>

1198
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:28,370
<i>We shine like rainbows</i>

1199
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:32,630
<i>Shine like rainbows</i>

1200
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,130
<i>We shine like rainbows</i>

1201
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,600
<i>Shine like rainbows.</i>

1202
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,370
No doubt about it, Spike.

1203
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,880
There's definitely something strange
going on at that school.
