00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,400
Who would want to record
a history that sad?

176
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,840
Gilda: It's not sad!

177
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,620
Do we look sad to you?

178
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,600
Pinkie, I think I know
why the map sent us here!

179
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,500
We need to find
the idol of Boreas

180
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,240
and bring glory and pride
back to Griffonstone!

181
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,980
Ha ha.

182
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,520
Here we go, typical
pony hero complex.

183
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,840
None of us care about
that dumb old idol.

184
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,820
Don't you get it?

185
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,320
We don't care about anything
and that's the way we like it.

186
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
I think Rainbow Dash is right.

187
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,260
The map sent us here to
fix some sort of problem.

188
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,320
The only problem
Griffonstone has is you!

189
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,140
Well, I don't care
what she says.

190
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,400
We're going to
find that treasure,

191
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,420
make Griffonstone cool again,
and get back to Ponyville.

192
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,940
C'mon!

193
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,040
Wait, Rainbow Dash, what
about Twilight's advice?

194
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,360
What, taking a
bunch of pictures?

195
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,940
She mentioned finding
answers at the library.

196
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,260
Knock yourself out.

197
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,740
But when you get bored
with Twilight's tour book,

198
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,960
I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss
finding the idol of Boreas.

199
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,700
I'm here to find your missing
idol and save Griffonstone!

200
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,940
Uh, I'll need some
rope, a grappling hook,

201
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,320
and a guide to take me
down to the Abysmal Abyss.

202
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,120
And I'll need some bits.

203
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,040
Hey, Gilda!

204
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,320
Word on the street is that
Griffonstone has an amazing

205
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,060
library chock-full of answers!

206
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,120
Word on what street?

207
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,860
OK, maybe not this street.

208
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,060
But on other streets, your
library is the talk of the town.

209
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,680
The library's right there

210
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,920
so why don't you go inside

211
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,160
AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,520
[gasp]

213
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,800
Maybe it's good that
Twilight didn't come.

214
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,280
It's sad what happened
to your town, King.

215
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,100
But Rainbow Dash can't be right.

216
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,180
This can't all be because
of a missing hunk of gold.

217
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,180
"You're right, Pinkie.

218
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,300
And you've got amazing hair."

219
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,780
Aw, King Grover,
you old charmer.

220
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,740
I know what Griffonstone needs!

221
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,300
Fewer ponies?

222
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,100
A song!

223
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,400
I've got a super
song about smiling

224
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,660
that's sure to make even the
most grumpy griffon grin!

225
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,940
[big inhale]

226
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,900
You can't sing here.

227
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,260
But how do you break into uplifting
musical numbers with no singing?

228
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,840
Yeah, that's Griffonstone's
biggest problem.

229
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,900
Lack of uplifting
musical numbers.

230
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,580
Well, if I can't sing,
how 'bout a party?

231
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,880
If there's one thing these griffons
need, it's some good cheer.

232
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,220
Where's your party store?

233
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,980
No party store?

234
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,600
Aw. How about cake?

235
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,220
Nothing cheers
folks up like cake!

236
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,120
Where's your bakery?

237
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,760
[groan]

238
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,100
NO SINGING?

239
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,460
NO PARTY STORE?

240
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,640
NO BAKERY?

241
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,320
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

242
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,540
You're welcome to
leave at any time.

243
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,040
[crash]

244
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Well, that just takes the cake.

245
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,460
Wait, no.

246
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,560
It can't take the cake
cause there is no cake!

247
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,660
Or muffins!

248
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Or Griffon Scones!

249
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,220
Oh, we got Griffon Scones.

250
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,500
That's my specialty.

251
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,780
I'll buy one!

252
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,160
[chomp]

253
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,620
Bits first.

254
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,780
[crackling]

255
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,580
Well?

256
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,320
[crackling]

257
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,240
What, you like it?

258
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,800
That's my Grampa
Gruff's secret recipe.

259
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:48,700
[snap]

260
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,060
Ow! I think I broke a tooth.

261
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,640
Well, whatever, no refunds.

262
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,480
I don't even care anyway.

263
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,020
I just want to sell
enough of these

264
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,040
so I can leave this lousy town.

265
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,680
I can help you with that!

266
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,080
[whistling wind]

267
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,820
Uh, you think you could
tighten the strap on my helmet?

268
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,720
Can you give me more bits?

269
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,240
Never mind.

270
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,120
I got it.

271
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,060
So how deep is this abyss?

272
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,940
How deep are your pockets?

273
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,220
Don't you griffons ever talk
about anything but bits?

274
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,080
Give me some bits
and I'll answer.

275
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,520
No wonder Gilda's
such a delight.

276
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,860
Grampa Gruff's recipe is good,

277
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,120
but it's missing one
important ingredient.

278
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,380
Don't tell me...friendship?

279
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,920
Uh, no.

280
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,300
Baking powder.

281
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,960
Lucky for you I never
leave home without it!

282
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,460
Now just pop those in the oven
and you'll have Griffon Scones

283
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,000
worth their weight in gold!

284
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,400
[sniff sniff]

285
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,880
[crash]

286
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,440
Greta: Oof!

287
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,520
Greta!

288
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,280
Pinkie: AH-HA!

289
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,760
I saw that, Gilda!

290
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,680
You may act like a
gruff, grumbling griffon,

291
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,660
but inside you're
gracious and great!

292
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,040
What are you talking about?

293
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,780
You just helped your friend
up when she got knocked down.

294
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,140
What, her?

295
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,180
Gilda: Greta's just some
griffon I know.

296
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,240
We don't have friends here.

297
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,320
[sigh]

298
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
I did have a friend once,

299
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,680
but you saw how that turned out.

300
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,080
Oh my gosh!

301
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,780
I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!

302
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,780
See ya.

303
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,220
[whistling wind]

304
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,540
You sure we can't just fly down?

305
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,160
Whoa!

306
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,880
Never mind.

307
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,660
Totally got my answer there.

308
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,620
Just gotta find that Golden
Idol and get out of this place!

309
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:48,960
[snap]

310
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,300
Aaaaah!

311
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,780
Aaaaah!

312
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,140
Oof!

313
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,520
Oh! Oww!

314
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,080
Ooh!

315
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,940
My hoof!

316
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,300
Help!

317
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,540
Throw me another rope!

318
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,820
You got bits?

319
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,840
Wait!

320
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,220
HELP!

321
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,580
[whistling wind]

322
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,540
AHHHHH!

323
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,800
Pinkie: There you are!

324
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,980
Forget about finding the idol.

325
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,700
I figured out how to solve
Griffonstone's real problem!

326
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,140
SCONES!

327
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,960
PINKIE PIE, YOU GET BACK HERE!

328
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,600
Yeah?

329
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,980
Can you throw down
a rope or something?

330
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,240
Lemme look.

331
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,820
One rope, comin' up!

332
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,060
We need help!

333
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,160
Don't go anywhere!

334
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,460
Where does she
think I'm gonna go?

335
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,200
[crack]

336
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,600
Unh!

337
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,500
I hope I don't go anywhere!

338
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,540
Pinkie Pie: Rainbow Dash is stuck
on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss

339
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,820
and I need your
help to save her!

340
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Not my problem.

341
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,560
Of course it's your problem!

342
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,700
She's your friend!

343
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
Used to be.

344
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,280
Can't you remember when she was?

345
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,660
Yeah.

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,840
Of course.

347
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,300
Doesn't that griffon know that
she's supposed to fly

348
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,660
at the Junior
Speedsters Flight Camp?

349
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,980
Maybe she just doesn't
want to make you look bad.

350
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,700
Hey there!

351
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,980
I'm Rainbow Dash.

352
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,460
And you are...?

353
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,680
Uh, G-Gilda?

354
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,560
You sure about that?

355
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,640
Stick with me, Gilda,

356
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,280
and those guys won't
give you any more guff!

357
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,680
Whoa! You're awesome!

358
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,440
[giggle]

359
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,620
You too, Rainbow Dash!

360
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,860
[whoosh]

361
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,640
Well, Gilda, let's show
these guys how it's done.

362
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,080
Junior Speedsters are our lives!

363
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,520
Sky bound soars
and daring dives!

364
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,820
Junior Speedsters
it's our quest,

365
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,460
to someday be the VERY BEST!

366
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,440
Fine.

367
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,380
I'll help her.

368
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,320
But that doesn't
make me her friend.

369
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,420
Duly noted.

370
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,280
Except it does.

371
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,420
[whistling wind]

372
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,360
Hang on, loser!

373
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,820
I'm coming!

374
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,760
What took you so long, doofus?

375
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,420
[scream]

376
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,700
RAINBOW DASH!

377
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,420
I'M COMIN' FOR YA!

378
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,640
AAAAAAHHHH!

379
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,720
Gotcha!

380
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,740
Hold on, you two!

381
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,220
[grunts]

382
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,060
Huh?

383
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,440
[gasp]

384
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,080
The idol of Boreas!

385
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,520
[grunts]

386
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,560
I'm slipping!

387
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,760
[grunts]

388
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,140
Both: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

389
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,180
[snap]

390
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,040
The idol!

391
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,540
You're more important to me
than some dumb chunk of gold!

392
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,000
[crumbling]

393
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,020
Hugging later!

394
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,660
Climbing NOW!

395
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,060
I'm really sorry about
how I treated you two.

396
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,460
Thanks, Gilda.

397
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,440
Apology accepted.

398
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,100
And I'm just sorry we
didn't get your idol back.

399
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,380
Now we'll never be able to
solve Griffonstone's problem.

400
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,720
That's what I was
trying to tell you!

401
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,840
The map didn't send us here to
find the lost idol of Boreas.

402
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,400
It sent us here to replace
it with something better!

403
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,460
Nothing's better than
gold to a griffon.

404
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,960
That's because you
don't have friendship.

405
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,500
If you can learn to care
about each other again,

406
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,780
Griffonstone could be a mightier
kingdom than it ever was before!

407
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,540
And you don't need some
golden idol to do that.

408
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
You just need each other.

409
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,260
Whoa, Pinkie.

410
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,740
That was...really sappy.

411
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,680
Eh, what can I say?

412
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,920
That's how I roll.

413
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,820
Go on, Gilda.

414
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,300
Go make a friend.

415
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,400
I don't know, Pinkie.

416
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,400
You really think these
griffons are up for this?

417
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,820
We aren't exactly in
Ponyville, you know.

418
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,420
Gilda: OK.

419
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,320
So she was really weirded out
until I gave her the scone.

420
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,680
Then she tried it and
said it tasted good!

421
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,080
That's the first nice thing
any griffon's ever said to me!

422
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,060
Whoa, Pinkie!

423
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,760
I guess that really was the
problem we needed to solve.

424
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,760
Baking powder makes baked
goods and friendships

425
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,100
fluffy and delicious!

426
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,260
Well, we better
be headin' home.

427
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,100
What? Y-y-you want me to spread
friendship here by myself?

428
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,420
How am I supposed to do that?

429
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,140
I haven't even made
one single friend yet!

430
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,380
No, you haven't.

431
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,420
You've made two.

432
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,500
Hugging!

433
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,340
Hugging now!

434
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,660
But you'll come back
and visit, right?

435
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,940
Just try and stop us!

436
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,340
See you later,
you old charmer.

437
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,960
Uh, Pinkie?

438
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,220
Who are you
talking to?

439
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,820
Nopony! Come on, let's go
home and see how Gummy did

440
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,900
with Granny Pie's
marjolaine recipe...
