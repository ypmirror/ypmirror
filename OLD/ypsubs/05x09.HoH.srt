Every last shred of evidence

180
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,040
of the organization's
existence was destroyed.

181
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,720
Celestia demanded
complete deniability.

182
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,160
What?

183
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,020
It was me who
captured the Bugbear.

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,880
I had to go deep cover
here in Ponyville

185
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,340
and assume the name Bon Bon.

186
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
I never thought it'd
be able to track me.

187
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,640
But now it has.

188
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,840
Are you saying our whole
friendship was based on a lie?

189
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm sorry, Lyra, I couldn't tell
you for your own protection.

190
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,020
But, but the lunches,
the, the long talks,

191
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,460
the benches we've sat on!

192
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,300
None of that was real?

193
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
It was all real.

194
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,400
You're my very best friend.

195
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,260
[distant growl]

196
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,820
I've got to go find a
crowd to blend into

197
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,060
before I put you in danger.

198
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,300
I'll see you at the wedding.

199
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,140
Fine. But we're going to
talk about this later!

200
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,600
I need my ring today,
no matter the cost!

201
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,060
As long as it doesn't
cost any extra.

202
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
7-10 split, man.
Harshest of the harsh.

203
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,320
But if you pick this up,
we win the whole shebang.

204
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,240
Doc! I finally figured
out how I can help!

205
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Your flameless fireworks
look just like flowers!

206
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,440
I'll use them for the wedding!

207
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,840
Great whickering
stallions. Wait!

208
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,360
Wait!

209
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,920
The flameless fireworks
are extremely volatile!

210
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,600
Without knowing
what the trigger is,

211
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,120
they could go off at any moment!

212
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,060
My word, is that a Bugbear?

213
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,880
Matilda: There are so many
things I'm forgetting!

214
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,800
I hope Cranky remembers
to tell the musicians.

215
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,960
Oh, oh! I'll never get
my mane done in time!

216
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,600
You must relax, my dear!
We can handle anything.

217
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,640
We once did a pony's
hair during the ceremony.

218
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,080
Oh, it's true!
It's true!

219
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,760
They really are the best!

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,160
Matilda, I've just got to say I
already feel like we're family.

221
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,520
You do?

222
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,800
Of course!

223
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm Stephen Magnet,
Cranky's best beast!

224
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,140
You're Stephen Magnet?

225
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,820
Well, what'd you
expect, a Bugbear?

226
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,920
I've known Cranky forever!

227
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,900
Surely he must have told
you about the time

228
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,680
he saved me from
Flashfreeze Lake.

229
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,780
You're Stephen Magnet?

230
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,060
Oh, I know, I KNOW!

231
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,020
Typical Cranky to leave
out minor details,

232
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,560
like the fact that I'm, you
know, a sea monster, right?

233
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,880
[laugh]

234
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh, I just love that old burro.

235
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,180
I'm sorry, Stephen, I guess
I assumed you were a pony.

236
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,700
And I had no idea you had
such adventures together.

237
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,680
Oh, honey! You don't
know the half of it.

238
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,300
But let me tell you something:

239
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,240
in all that we've been
through together,

240
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,240
the only thing he ever
cared about was finding you.

241
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,340
Really?

242
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,240
Well, that and a
baldness cure. [giggle]

243
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,000
He is the sweetest
thing, isn't he?

244
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,720
All the stress I've
put myself through.

245
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,500
All the stress I've
put him through!

246
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,720
The only thing that matters
is that we're together.

247
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,300
The wedding isn't the important
thing; the marriage is.

248

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,260
Oh, my goodness gracious!

If you believe that, I have
got a bridge to sell you!

251

All these ponies
travelling to Ponyville,

uncomfortable clothes,

253
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,400
sitting through a
long ceremony...

254
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,140

care about the marriage?

So, uh,you didn't happen to

about my secret identity
to anypony, did you?

No. I did not.

with a secret, you know.

You know those
expensive imported oats

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,320

gathered here today

in maretrimony.

331
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,780

I can only imagine

332
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,520

Cranky must be.

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,020

335
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,300
But I also see so many ponies
from all trots of life

336
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,040
brought together by love.

337
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,660
Cranky searched all across
this great land of ours

338
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,020
to find Matilda.

339
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000
And no matter what
obstacles kept them apart,

340
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,480
love would finally
bring them together,

341
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,300
just as it has brought
all of us together now.

342
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,740
It's remarkable to
me how a story

343
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,720
like Cranky's search for
Matilda could fill this room

344
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
with such a unique
collection of ponies.

345
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,940
It makes you realize
that everypony

346
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,300
is the star of their own story.

347
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,580
And it's not just the main
characters in our stories

348
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,020
that make life so rich.

349
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,860
It's everypony, those
who play big parts

350
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,260
and those who play small.

351
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,700
If it weren't for
everypony in this room

352
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,020
and many more who
couldn't be here today,

353
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,160
Cranky and Matilda's lives
wouldn't be as full

354
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,300
and vibrant as they are.

355
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,240
[loud sobbing]

356
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
And so, in front of all
these loved ones...

357
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,540
Cranky, do you take this donkey
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

358
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,440
You bet I do.

359
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,060
And do you, Matilda,
take this donkey

360
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,120
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

361
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,660
I do.

362
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:39,180
Then I'm proud to say, I now
pronounce you jack and jenny!

363
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,220
[cheers]

364
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,860
[popping explosions]

365
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
Of course! They need
love to ignite!

366
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,520
How could I have missed it?

367
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,080
You know something, girls?

368
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,120
We are so lucky to
live in this town.

369
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,180
I love you all.

370
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,540
Rainbow Dash: Ow! That's
where the Bugbear bit me.

371
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,480
Twilight Sparkle: Sorry.
