1
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:08,228
Once upon a time,
in a magical land of Equestria...

2
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:12,510
...there were two regal sisters
who ruled together...

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:14,935
...and created harmony for all the land.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,289
To do this, the eldest used her unicorn
powers to raise the sun at dawn...

5
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:23,593
...the younger brought out
the moon to begin the night.

6
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:28,766
Thus, the two sisters maintained balance
for their kingdom and their subjects:

7
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:31,128
All the different types of ponies.

8
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:34,868
But as time went on,
the younger sister became resentful.

9
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:39,069
The ponies relished and played in the day
her elder sister brought forth...

10
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:41,996
...but shunned and slept
through her beautiful night.

11
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:47,716
One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused
to lower the moon to make way for the dawn.

12
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,716
The elder sister tried to reason with her...

13
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,090
...but the bitterness in the young one's heart...

14
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:56,151
...had transformed her into a
wicked mare of darkness:

15
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:58,327
Nightmare Moon.

16
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:02,403
She vowed that she would shroud
the land in eternal night.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,156
Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed
the most powerful magic known to ponydom:

18
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:10,774
The Elements of Harmony!

19
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:15,573
Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony,
she defeated her younger sister...

20
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,922
...and banished her permanently in the moon.

21
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:23,790
The elder sister took on responsibility
for both sun and moon....

22
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:27,455
...and harmony has been maintained
in Equestria for generations since.

23
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,906
Hm... Elements of Harmony.

24
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:35,406
I know I've heard of those before.

25
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,215
But where?

26
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:45,318
<i>My Little Pony, My Little Pony...
Aaaaah...</i>

27
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,468
<i>My Little Pony</i>

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,744
<i>I used to wonder what friendship could be.</i>

29
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:51,451
<i>My Little Pony</i>

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,979
<i>Until you all shared its magic with me.</i>

31
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,086
<i>Big adventure
Tons of fun</i>

32
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:58,244
<i>A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong</i>

33
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:00,155
<i>Sharing kindness
It's an easy feat</i>

34
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:02,189
<i>And magic makes it all complete!</i>

35
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,389
<i>You have My Little Pony...</i>

36
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:11,484
<i>Do you know you are my very best friends?</i>

37
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,901
There you are, Twilight!

38
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:23,397
Moondancer is having a little get-together
in the west castle courtyard.

39
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,599
You wanna come?

40
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:29,079
Oh, sorry girls. I got a lot
of studying to catch up on.

41
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:34,850
Does that pony do anything except study?

42
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,330
I think she's more interested
in books than friends.

43
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:41,275
I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.

44
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,575
Spike! Spike!!!

45
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:57,950
Spike?

46
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,476
There you are.

47
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,884
Quick, find me that old copy of
"Predictions and prophecies".

48
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:05,921
What's that for?

49
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:10,354
Well, it was a gift for Moondancer, but...

50
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:14,181
Oh, Spike. You know we don't
have time for that sort of thing.

51
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:15,990
But we're on a break!

52
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:24,570
No... no, no, no no no!

53
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:26,774
SPIKE!!!

54
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,591
It's over here!

55
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:39,607
Elements... elements, e e e... Aha!

56
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:43,070
Elements of Harmony... See: Mare in the Moon?

57
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:46,599
Mare in the Moon?
But that's just an old ponies' tale.

58
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:48,936
Mare... mare... AHA!

59
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:52,336
"The Mare in the Moon - myth
from olden pony times..."

60
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:54,938
"...a powerful pony, who
wanted to rule Equestria..."

61
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,984
"...defeated by the Elements of Harmony
and imprisoned in the moon."

62
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,904
"Legend has it that on the longest
day of the thousandth year..."

63
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:05,333
"...the stars will aid in her escape and
she will bring about nighttime eternal."

64
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:07,819
Spike! Do you know what this means?

65
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,097
No.

66
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:14,437
Take a note, please. To the Princess.

67
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:15,868
Okie dokie.

68
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:21,026
"My dearest teacher. My continuing studies
of pony magic have led me to discover..."

69
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,879
-"...that we're on the precipice of disaster."
-Hold on!

70
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:26,086
Preci... preci...

71
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,088
-Threshold.
-Threee...

72
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:33,552
Uh... Brink?

73
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:38,797
That something really bad is about to happen!

74
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:44,473
"For you see, the mythical Mare in
the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon..."

75
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:48,349
"...and she's about to return to Equestria
and bring with her eternal night."

76
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:52,341
"Something must be done to make sure this
terrible prophecy does not come true."

77
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:57,717
"I await your quick response.
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

78
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:02,463
Twilight. Sparkle. Got it!

79
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:03,563
Great! Send it.

80
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:05,554
-Now?
-Of course!

81
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,079
I don't know, Twilight.

82
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,937
Princess Celestia is a little busy getting
ready for the Summer Sun Celebration.

83
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,796
And it's, like, the day after tomorrow.

84
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,326
That's just it, Spike.

85
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:19,383
The day after tomorrow is the thousandth
year of the Summer Sun Celebration.

86
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:22,033
It's imperative that
the Princess is told right away.

87
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:26,867
Impera... impera...

88
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,154
Important!

89
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,901
Okay, okay.

90
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:35,874
There! It's on its way.

91
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,676
But I wouldn't hold your breath.

92
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:39,996
Oh, I'm not worried, Spike.

93
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:41,896
The Princess trusts me completely.

94
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:45,336
In all the years she's been my mentor,
she's never once doubted me.

95
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,686
See? I knew she would wanna
take immediate action.

96
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:56,391
"My dearest, most faithful student, Twilight."

97
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:00,513
"You know that I value your diligence
and that I trust you completely."

98
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:04,688
"But you simply must stop
reading those dusty old books."

99
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,118
"My Dear Twilight. There is more to
a young pony's life than studying."

100
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,401
"So I'm sending you
to supervise the preparations..."

101
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:20,026
"...for the Summer Sun Celebration in
this year's location, Ponyville."

102
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:25,040
"And I have an even more essential
task for you to complete."

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,260
"Make some friends!"

104
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:30,370
Look on the bright side, Twilight.

105
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:34,272
The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library.
Doesn't that make you happy?

106
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:38,174
Yes! Yes it does. You know why?
Because I'm right.

107
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,497
I'll check on the preparations
as fast as I can...

108
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,452
...then get to the library and find
some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.

109
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:46,698
Then when will you make friends,
like the Princess said?

110
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:51,284
She said to check on preparations.
I am her student and I'll do my royal duty.

111
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:54,481
But the fate of Equestria does
not rest on me making friends.

112
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,693
Thank you, sirs.

113
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,046
Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have
interesting things to talk about?

114
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:06,750
Come on, Twilight. Just try.

115
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:10,009
Hello?

116
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,698
Well, that was interesting, all right.

117
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,675
Summer Sun Celebration:
Official Overseer's Checklist.

118
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:27,900
Number 1: Banquet preparations.
Sweet Apple Acres.

119
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:30,433
YEEHAW!

120
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:39,145
Let's get this over with.

121
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:42,694
Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle...

122
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,906
Well, howdy-do, miss Twilight?
A pleasure makin' your acquaintance.

123
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,200
I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres
sure do like makin' new friends.

124
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:54,254
Friends? Actually... I...

125
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,165
So, what can I do you for?

126
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:03,794
Well, I am in fact here to supervise
preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration.

127
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,659
And you're in charge of the food?

128
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,532
We sure as sugar are.
Would you care to sample some?

129
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,824
As long as it doesn't take too long.

130
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,057
Soup's on, everypony!

131
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,256
Now, why don't I introduce
y'all to the Apple family?

132
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:27,411
Thanks, but I really need to hurry.

133
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:31,489
This here's Apple Fritter,
Apple Bumpkin, Red Gala...

134
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,865
...Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel
Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apple,
Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp...

135
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:43,151
Big Macintosh, Apple Bloom
aaaand Granny Smith.

136
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:46,158
Up and at 'em Granny Smith. We got guests.

137
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:49,345
Wha...? Soup's on?

138
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,549
I'm up, here I come, I'm comin'...

139
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:54,808
Why, I'd say they're already part of the family.

140
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,834
Okay. Well, I can see the food situation
is handled, so we'll be on our way.

141
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:04,943
Aren't you gonna to stay for brunch?

142
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:10,372
Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do...

143
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:15,388
Fine.

144
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:25,146
Food's all taken care of. Next is weather.

145
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,625
Ugh... I ate too much pie.

146
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,856
There's supposed to be a pegasus pony
named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.

147
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:38,933
Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?

148
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:48,090
Uh... Excuse me?

149
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,671
Let me help you.

150
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:06,191
Oops. I guess I overdid it.
Um... uh, how about this?

151
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:10,666
My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry.

152
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,378
No no, don't thank me. You're quite welcome.

153
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:26,073
Let me guess, you're Rainbow Dash.

154
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,589
The one and only!

155
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,450
Why? You heard of me?

156
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:33,087
I heard you're supposed
to be keeping the sky clear.

157
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,683
I'm Twilight Sparkle and the Princess
sent me to check on the weather.

158
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,579
Yeah, yeah. That'll be a snap.

159
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,735
I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon
as I'm done practicing.

160
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,293
Practicing for what?

161
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,491
The Wonderbolts!

162
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:48,963
They're gonna perform at
the celebration tomorrow.

163
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,383
And I'm gonna show 'em my stuff.

164
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,676
-*The* Wonderbolts?
-Yup.

165
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,010
The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?

166
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:57,949
That's them!

167
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:59,364
Pfft... Please.

168
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:03,866
They'd never accept a pegasus who can't
even keep the sky clear for one measly day.

169
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:07,523
Hey. I could clear the sky in ten seconds flat.

170
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:09,168
Prove it.

171
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:19,044
Loop-de-loop around and WHAM!

172
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:24,045
What'd I say. Ten. Seconds. Flat.

173
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:26,603
I'd never leave Ponyville hanging.

174
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,398
You should see the look on your face.

175
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:36,104
You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle.
I can't wait to hang out some more.

176
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:40,745
Wow. She's amazing!

177
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,268
Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it.

178
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:55,234
Decorations. Beautiful...

179
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,757
Yes. The decor's coming along nicely.

180
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,086
This oughta be quick.
I'll be at the library in no time.

181
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:02,516
Beautiful indeed.

182
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,886
Not the decor. Her!

183
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,553
No, no, no... Oh my goodness no.

184
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,675
How are my spines? Are they straight?

185
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:16,047
Good afternoon.

186
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:19,049
Just a moment, please.
I'm in the zone as it were.

187
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:23,154
Oh yes! Sparkle always does
the trick, does it not?

188
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,134
Why, Rarity, you are a talent!

189
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,064
Now... um, how can I help youuuuaAARGH!

190
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:33,500
Oh my stars, darling! What ever
happened to your coiffure?

191
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,019
Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story.

192
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,932
I'm just here to check on the decorations
and then I'll be out of your hair.

193
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,813
Out of MY hair? What about YOUR hair?

194
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,853
Wait! Where are we going? HELP!

195
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:51,027
No, no, uh-uh.

196
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:57,108
Too green. Too yellow. Too puffy.
Not puffy enough. Too frilly. Too shiny.

197
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:01,946
Now go on, my dear.
You were telling me where you're from.

198
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:09,523
I've... urgh... been... sent...
from... Canterlot... to...

199
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:12,616
Canterlot?!

200
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:15,980
Oh, I am so envious. The glamor, the sophistication.

201
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:18,826
I've always dreamed of living there!

202
00:13:18,903 --> 00:13:21,987
I can't wait to hear all about it.

203
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,521
We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I.

204
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,899
Emerald?! What was I thinking?

205
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,946
Let me get you some rubies!

206
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:33,661
Quick! Before she decides
to dye my coat a new color.

207
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,681
Wasn't she wonderful?

208
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:41,604
Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?

209
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:45,273
Oh. Music. It's the last one.

210
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:59,080
Oh my. Um... Stop, please, everyone.

211
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:05,488
Excuse me, sir. I mean, no offense.
But your rhythm is just a teeny, tiny bit off.

212
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:11,213
Now follow me, please. A one.
A two. A one-two-three...

213
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:11,870
Hello!

214
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:16,661
Oh my. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten your birds.

215
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:20,216
I'm just here to check up on the music
and it's sounding beautiful.

216
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:27,610
I'm Twilight Sparkle.

217
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:30,981
What's your name?

218
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,753
Um... I'm Fluttershy...

219
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,548
I'm sorry, what was that?

220
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,701
My name is <mumble mumble>...

221
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,166
Didn't quite catch that.

222
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:54,720
Well, um, it looks like your birds are back,
so I guess everything's in order.

223
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:56,389
Keep up the good work!

224
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:00,326
Ooookay.

225
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:02,708
Well, that was easy.

226
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,684
A BABY DRAGON!

227
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:09,915
Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before.

228
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:12,443
He's so cute!

229
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:14,334
Well well well.

230
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:18,187
Oh my, he talks.
I didn't know dragons could talk.

231
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:21,339
That's just so incredibly wonderful. I...

232
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,792
I just don't even know what to say.

233
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:26,284
Well, in that case we better be going.

234
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:28,702
Wait, wait! What's his name?

235
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,040
I'm Spike.

236
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,301
Hi, Spike. I'm Fluttershy.

237
00:15:32,302 --> 00:15:36,407
Wow! A talking dragon!
And what do dragons talk about?

238
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:41,379
-Well, what do you wanna know?
-Absolutely everything!

239
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:47,807
Well, I started out as a cute
little purple-and-green egg...

240
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:51,623
...and that's the story of my whole entire life.

241
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,807
Well, up until today.
Do you wanna hear about today?

242
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:56,806
Oh yes, please!

243
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:00,962
I am so sorry! How did we get here so fast?

244
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,976
This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville.

245
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,568
-And my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
-No, I don't!

246
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,919
Awww, wook at that. He's so sweepy, he
can't even keep his wittle bawance.

247
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,540
Poor thing. You simply must get into bed!

248
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:19,437
Yes yes. We'll get right on that.
Well, goodnight!

249
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,545
Huh. Rude much?

250
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:26,459
Sorry, Spike. But I have to convince the
Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming...

251
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,685
...and we're running out of time!
I just need to be alone, so I can study...

252
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:32,395
...without a bunch of crazy ponies
trying to make friends all the time.

253
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:33,774
Now where's the light?

254
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:36,840
SURPRISE!

255
00:16:40,722 --> 00:16:42,213
Surprise!

256
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,092
Hi! I'm Pinkie Pie and I threw
this party just for you!

257
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:47,172
Were you surprised, were you, were you?
Huh huh huh?

258
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,793
Very surprised.
Libraries are supposed to be quiet.

259
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:53,851
That's silly! What kind of welcome
party would this be if it were quiet?

260
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,188
I mean, DUH! BORING!

261

00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:27,457
Are you alright, sugar cube?

269
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:32,970
Awww, she's so happy, she's crying!

270
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,406
Hot sauce.

271
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:42,782
What? It's good!

272
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:54,844
Hey, Twilight! Pinkie Pie started
Pin the Tail on the Pony. Wanna play?

273
00:17:54,931 --> 00:18:00,094
No! All the ponies in this town are CRAZY!
Do you know what time it is?

274
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:02,415
It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration.

275
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,755
Everypony has to stay up or they'll
miss the Princess raise the sun.

276
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:09,679
You really should lighten up Twilight.
It's a party!

277
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:15,869
Here I thought I'd have time to learn
more about the Elements of Harmony.

278
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:20,246
But, silly me, all this ridiculous
friendmaking has kept me from it!

279
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,842
"Legend has it that in the longest day
of the thousandth year..."

280
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:31,044
"...the stars will aid in her escape and
she will bring about everlasting night."

281
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:36,953
I hope the Princess was right.
I hope it really is just an old pony tale.

282
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,496
Come on, Twilight!
It's time to watch the sun rise!

283
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:49,383
Isn't this exciting?

284
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,951

But, I mean, really, who can top that?

287
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:05,542
Fillies and gentlecolts.

288
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,828
As mayor of Ponyville,
it is my great pleasure...

289
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:12,788
...to announce the beginning
of the Summer Sun Celebration!

290
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:20,438
In just a few moments our town will
witness the magic of the sunrise.

291
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:24,103
And celebrate this, the longest day of the year!

292
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:29,391
And now it is my great honor to
introduce to you the ruler of our land.

293
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,982
The very pony, who gives us the sun
and the moon each and every day.

294
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:37,728
The good, the wise, the bringer
of harmony to all of Equestria...

295
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:38,842
Ready?

296
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:41,362
...Princess Celestia!

297
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:47,976
This can't be good.

298
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:52,827
Remain calm, everypony.
There must be a reasonable explanation.

299
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,813
I love guessing games! Is she hiding?

300
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,505
She's gone!

301
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,949
She's good!

302
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:09,353
Oh no...

303
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,532
Nightmare Moon!

304
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,717
Oh, my beloved subjects!

305
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:23,079
It's been so long since I've seen your
precious little sun-loving faces.

306
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:25,334
What did you do with our Princess?!

307
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,106
Whoa there, Nelly...!

308
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:33,793
Why, am I not royal enough for you?
Don't you know who I am?

309
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:35,380
More guessing games!

310
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,722
Um... Pokey Smokes!
How about Queen Meanie?

311
00:20:38,723 --> 00:20:40,888
No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty...!

312
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:48,276
Does my crown no longer count now that
I have been imprisoned for a thousand years?

313
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,022
Did you not recall the legend?
Did you not see the signs?

314
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,585
I did! And I know who you are!

315
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,413
You're the Mare in the Moon.

316
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:57,828
Nightmare Moon.

317
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:03,211
Well well well. Somepony who remembers me.

318
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:05,258
Then you also know why I'm here.

319
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:07,547
You're here to... to...

320
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,168
Remember this day, little ponies,
for it was your last.

321
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,148
From this moment forth...

322
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,503
THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER!

323
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:34,087
