1
00:00:00,851 --> 00:00:03,534
Come on, Twilight. You can do it.

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:05,355
Okay. Here goes...

3
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,995
HA-HA! You did it!

4
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:14,529
Growing magic. That's number 25.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,280
Twenty five different types of tricks and counting.

6
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:20,335
And I think this is the best trick so far.

7
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:22,321
Hello, Rarity.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,788
What's that? Oh, it's the nothing.
Just my awesome mustache.

9
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:33,150
Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you
look, it's just for practice and it's gotta go.

10
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:34,524
Wait!

11
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:37,645
Rats.

12
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:19,491
Twenty five, Twilight! Twenty five
different kinds of tricks and counting.

13
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:24,497
I though unicorns are only supposed to have
a little magic that matches their special talents.

14
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,636
True. For ponies whose talents are
for things like cooking or singing or math.

15
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:31,840
But what if the unicorn's
special talent *is* magic?

16
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,982
Like you, Twilight. And you know a ton of magic.

17
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:39,012
Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are
lots of ponies right here in Ponyville...

18
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:40,862
...that know just as much magic as me.

19
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:41,900
Are you kidding?

20
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,843
I don't think there's another unicorn in all
of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.

21
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:49,135
Gangway! Coming through!

22
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:53,749
Snips... Snails... Wh-What's going on?

23
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:55,861
Why, haven't you heard?

24
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,379
There is a new unicorn in town!

25
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,636
Yeah! They say that she's got more magical
powers than any other unicorn ever.

26
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:04,967
Really?

27
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,085
Oh, no way. That honor goes to Twilight here.

28
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,619
Where is this unicorn?

29
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,572
Oh, she's in the town square. Come on!

30
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:14,973
Yeah! Come on!

31
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:20,531
Come on, come all!

32
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:23,464
Come and witness the amazing magic...

33
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:27,658
★☆★ ...of the Great and Powerful Trixie! ★☆★

34
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:35,774
Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie...

35
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,661
...performs the most
spectacular feats of magic...

36
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:41,660
★☆★ ...ever witnessed by pony eyes! ★☆★

37
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:47,047
My, my, my. What boasting.

38
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:49,881
Come on! Nopony's as magical as Twi...

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,001
Twi... Twi...

40
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:55,081
Oh... H-Hey, Rarity, I...

41
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:56,851
Mustache!

42
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,461
There's nothing wrong with
being talented, is there?

43
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:01,518
Nothin' at all.

44
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,841
'cept when someone goes around showin' it off
like a schoolfilly with fancy new ribbons.

45
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,828
Just because one has the ability
to perform lots of magic...

46
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,140
...does not make one better than the rest of us.

47
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,685
Especially when you got me around
being better than the rest of us.

48
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:20,182
I mean... Yeah! Uh, Magic Shmagic! Boo!

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,814
Well, well, well.

50
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:26,217
It seems we have some
NEIGH-sayers in the audience.

51
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:30,239
Who is so ignorant as
to challenge the magical ability...

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,900
★☆★ ...of the Great and Powerful Trixie?! ★☆★

53
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:38,633
Do they not know that they're in the presence
of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?!

54
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,681
Just who does she think she is?

55
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:43,984
Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is...

56
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,105
Spike! Shhh...

57
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:46,761
What? What's wrong?

58
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:49,248
You see the way they reacted to Trixie?

59
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,657
I don't want anyone thinking I'm the showoff.

60
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:58,721
So, "Great and Powerful Trixie".

61
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:01,158
What makes you think
you're so awesome anyway?

62
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:07,568
Why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie
have magic strong enough to vanquish...

63
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,400
★☆★ ...the dreaded Ursa Major. ★☆★

64
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:18,014
-What?
-No way...

65
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:22,973
When all hope was lost, the ponies
of Hooffington had no one to turn to.

66
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:28,327
But the Great and Powerful Trixie
stepped in and, with her awesome magic...

67
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:31,807
...vanquished the Ursa Major and
sent it back to its cave...

68
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:34,541
★☆★ ...deep within the Everfree Forest. ★☆★

69
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,443
Sooo sweet!

70
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,576
That settles it.

71
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:45,275
Trixie truly is the most talented, most
magical, most awesome unicorn in Ponyville.

72
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:48,659
No! In all of Equestria!

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,859
How do you know? You didn't see it!
And besides, Twi...

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,493
It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers.

75
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:02,231
Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville.

76
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:06,805
Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie?

77
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,078
Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians.

78
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,466
Anything you can do, I can do better.

79
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,620
Any takers? Anyone?

80
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,651
Or is Trixie destined...

81
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:21,577
★☆★ ...to be the greatest ★☆★
equine who has ever lived?

82
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,917
Please! She's unbearable!

83
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,265
You gotta show her. You just gotta!

84
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:34,945
There's no way I'm gonna use my magic
now, Spike. Especially since...

85
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,214
How about...

86
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,335
YOU!

87
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,239
Well, how about it? Hm?

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,029
Is there anything you can do...

89
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,945
...that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?

90
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:50,563
I... I...

91
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:52,775
Well, little hayseed?

92
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:55,826
That's it! I can't stand for no more of this.

93
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,294
You show her, AJ!

94
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,141
Can your magical powers do this?

95
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,589
Top that, missy.

96
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,019
Oh, ye of little talent.

97
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,867
Watch and be amazed of the magic of Trixie.

98
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,367
Once again the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.

99
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:47,663
There is no need to go strutting
around and showing off like that.

100
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:48,734
Oh?

101
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:50,764
That's my job!

102
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:18,385
The don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothing.

103
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:26,535
When Trixie is through, the only
thing they'll call you is "loser".

104
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:40,908
I think I'm gonna be sick.

105
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:44,321
Seems like anypony with
a dash of good sense...

106
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:47,651
...would think twice before
tussling with the Great Trixie.

107
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,844
What we need is another
unicorn to challenge her.

108
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:57,122
Someone with some magic of her own.

109
00:07:57,123 --> 00:08:01,064
Yeah! A unicorn to show
this unicorn who's boss.

110
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,837
A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.

111
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,025
Enough! Enough all of you.

112
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:10,210
I take your hint, but Rarity
is above such nonsense.

113
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:12,875
Rainbow Dash and Applejack
may behave like ruffians...

114
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,570
...but Rarity conducts herself
with beauty and grace.

115
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:17,736
Ooo, what's the matter?

116
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:21,800
Afraid you'll get a hair out of place
in that rats nest you call a mane?

117
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:24,625
Oh, it is ON!

118
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:28,150
You may think you're tough with
all your so-called power...

119
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:30,867
...but there is more to magic
than your brutish ways.

120
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:33,683
A unicorn need to be more than just muscle.

121
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:36,523
A unicorn needs to have style.

122
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:41,446
A unicorn is not a unicorn
without grace and beauty.

123
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:45,948
Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her.

124
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:49,582
She's strong, she's beautiful, she's...

125
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,165
QUICK! I NEED A MIRROR!
GET ME A MIRROR!

126
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,456
What did she to my hair?!
I know she did something terrible to my hair!

127
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:02,747
-Nothing!
-It's fine.
-It's gorgeous.

128
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:04,148
It's green.

129
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:05,827
What?

130
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:10,785
No! Green hair?! Not green hair!

131
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:14,042
Such an awful, awful color...!

132
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:16,834
Well, I never...!

133
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:19,398
Well, Twilight. I guess it's up to you.

134
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,948
Come on. Show her what you're made of.

135
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,710
What do you mean? I'm nothing special.

136
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,004
Yes, you are! You're better that her.

137
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:28,732
I'm not better than anyone.

138
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:32,736
You think you're better than
the Great and Powerful Trixie?

139
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:35,141
You think you have more magical talent?

140
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,850
Well, come on. Show Trixie what you've got.

141
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,814
Show us all.

142
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:43,536
Who, me? I'm just run of the mill citizen of Ponyville.

143
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,553
No powerful magic here.

144
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,946
I... I think I can hear my laundry calling.

145
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:49,067
Sorry, gotta go.

146
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,479
Twilight?

147
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:57,142
Once again the Great and Powerful
Trixie has proven herself...

148
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,796
...to be the most amazing
unicorn in all of Equestria.

149
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:04,159
Was there ever any doubt?

150
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:14,388
Here's your smoothie you asked for.
With extra hay, just how you like it.

151
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,873
Hmmm... Hay.

152
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:23,415
Yes?

153
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:27,313
Oh, tell us another story,
Great and Powerful Trixie.

154
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:31,930
Yeah, tell us about how you
vanquished the Ursa Major.

155
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:38,214
Trixie is far too exhausted from
performing feats beyond imagination.

156
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,185
Begone with you until morning.

157
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:45,289
Of course, Great and Powerful Trixie.

158
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,615
Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.

159
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:52,303
What are you two doing?

160
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:55,700
-Just bringing the G&PT a...
-The what?

161
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,980
The Great And Powerful Trixie.

162
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:58,894
Sheesh...

163
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:01,013
Just bringing her a smoothie.

164
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:03,406
How can you fall for her lameness?

165
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:04,708
She's just a showoff.

166
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:05,765
Unlike Twilight...

167
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:11,549
The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished
an Ursa Major. Can your Twilight claim that?

168
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:12,799
Oh really?

169
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,739
Were you guys actually there?

170
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,539
Well, uh... no. But...

171
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,897
But nothing! The proof is in the pudding!

172
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,626
I like pudding.

173
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:28,892
Look. Unless an Ursa Major comes waltzing up
the street for Trixie to vanquish...

174
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:32,388
...I am not gonna believe a word she says.
And neither should you!

175
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:36,220
And Ursa walking up the street, ay?

176
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:38,917
Snails! You thinking what I'm thinking?

177
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:43,677
Why is it they call it a flea market
when they don't really sell fleas?

178
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:45,194
Yeah, uh...

179
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,800
Oh, come on!

180
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,701
Twilight, would you put down
that book and just listen to me?

181
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:57,527
Didn't you see how they hated
Trixie's bragging, Spike?

182
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:01,425
If I go out there and show off my magic,
I run the risk of losing them as friends.

183
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:05,922
It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'd be
using your magic to stand up for your friends.

184
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,165
No, Spike. It's exactly the same.

185
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,529
Come on, Twilight. Any one of these tricks, even
the tiniest, would be enough to show off Trixie.

186
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,359
I don't wanna be seen as a bragger like Trixie.

187
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,524
But you're the best!

188
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,921
Please, Spike, I said no!

189
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,862
If that's what you wanna be, then fine.

190
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:50,126
Oooh... How we gonna find an Ursa Major when
I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?

191
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:51,545
Hold on.

192
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,204
Oh. That's better.

193
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,968
Hey, guys. Where are you going?

194
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,371
-Can't talk now...!
-Got a major problem.

195
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:25,590
Yeah... Ursa Major, to be exact.

196
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:35,965
TRIXIE!!!

197
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:37,377
Twilight!

198
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:44,978
Trixie! Come out! You gotta help!

199
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:49,732
Trixie thought she said the Great and
Powerful Trixie did not wanna be disturbed.

200
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:53,322
We... We have a... a tiny problem.

201
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:55,949
Actually, it's a big one.

202
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:59,806
What is so important that you cannot
wait until morning to disturb Trixie?

203
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,545
Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!

204
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:20,481
I've already told you, Spike.
I don't wanna show off Trixie.

205
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:22,619
No, you don't understand. It's...

206
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,074
Uh, is that what I think it is?

207
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:28,674
Majorly.

208
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:32,262
Great and Powerful Trixie,
you've got to vanquish the Ursa!

209
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,010
Yeah! Vanquish so we can watch.

210
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:38,100
It took a lotta trouble to get that thing here.

211
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:40,459
Wait! You brought this here?!

212
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:43,184
Are you out of your little pony minds?

213
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,428
But you're the Great and Powerful Trixie.

214
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:49,171
Yeah, remember? You defeated an Ursa Major.

215
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,538
Uh, okay.

216
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:55,510
Stand back.

217
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,535
Piece a cake.

218
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:09,008
Oh, come on, Trixie.

219
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,108
Stop goofing around and vanquish it, eh?

220
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,980
Well, that was a dud.

221
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:25,481
Yeah, pfft... Come on!

222
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:29,584
Where's all the cool explosions and smoking?
Stuff like earlier, you know.

223
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:53,675
What's going on?

224
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,160
We brought an Ursa to town.

225
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:57,936
You WHAT?!

226
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:01,439
Don't worry, the Great and
Powerful Trixie will vanquish it.

227
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:03,543
I can't.

228
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,200
WHAT?!

229
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,257
Oh, I can't, I never have...

230
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,997
No one can vanquish an Ursa Major. I just
made the whole story up to make me look better.

231
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:13,177
MADE IT UP?!

232
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:00,897
Nice use of number 16.

233
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,034
Call me, dontcha know?

234
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:24,845
That's new.

235
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,481
Unbelievable!

236
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,019
That was amazing!

237
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:10,294
Heavens to Betsy! We knew
you had ability but not that much.

238
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:13,533
I'm sorry. Please, please, don't hate me.

239
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,220
Hate you?!

240
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,522
Why, what ever do you mean, darling?

241
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:22,782
Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's
showing off with her magic tricks and I just thought...

242
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:26,054
Whoah, whoah, whoah.
Magic's got nothing to do with it.

243
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:29,505
-Trixie's just a loud mouth.
-Most unpleasant.

244
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,326
All hat, no cattle.

245
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:34,418
So... you don't mind my magic tricks?

246
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:38,895
Your magic is a part of who you are, sugar cube.
And we like who you are.

247
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:42,288
We're proud to have such a powerful,
talented unicorn as our friend.

248
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:46,585
And after whupping that Ursa's
hind quarters we're even prouder.

249
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:47,905
You are?

250
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:53,402
Wow, Twilight! How'd you know
what to do with that Ursa Major?

251
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:55,980
That's what I was doing when
you came looking for me.

252
00:18:55,981 --> 00:19:00,134
I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that
I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.

253
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,889
So it is possible to vanquish
an Ursa Major all by yourself?

254
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,389
That wasn't an Ursa Major.
It was a baby. An Ursa Minor.

255
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,030
THAT was just a BABY?!

256
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:13,121
And it wasn't rampaging. It was just
cranky because *someone* woke it up.

257
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:17,631
If that was an Ursa Minor...

258
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:20,654
...then what's an Ursa Major like?

259
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:29,093
You don't wanna know.

260
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:32,044
Huh! You may have vanquished an Ursa Minor...

261
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,497
...but you will never have the
amazing showstopping ability...

262
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:38,190
★☆★ ...of the Great and Powerful Trixie! ★☆★

263
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:42,670
Why, that little...

264
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:44,248
Just let her go.

265
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:47,055
Maybe some day she'll learn her lesson.

266
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,074
Now, about you two.

267
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:54,391
Oh, we're sorry that we woke up the Ursa Minor.

268
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:57,697
We just wanted to see some AWESOME magic.

269
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:02,486
Yeah! And the way you vanquished
that Ursa Minor was AWESOME!

270
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:08,619
We deserve whatever punishment you give us.

271
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,745
For starters, you can clean up this mess.

272
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:16,780
And... What do you think, Spike?
Should I give them number 25?

273
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,803
Oh, twenty five, yes.

274
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:21,985
And I think I deserve it too.

275
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,086
I think you're right.

276
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,029
Sweet!

277
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:37,035
"Dear Princess Celestia."

278
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:40,639
"I have learned a very valuable
lesson about friendship."

279
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,171
"I was so afraid of being thought of as
a showoff that I was hiding a part of who I am."

280
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:49,030
"My friends helped he realize that
it's okay to be proud of your talents."

281
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,914
"And there are times when it's
appropriate to show them off."

282
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,203
"Especially when you're
standing up for your friends."

283
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:58,921
So, you finally admit that you're the most
talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?

284
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,009
Well... yeah.

285
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,957
But it's nothing to brag about.

286
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:05,357
So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?

287
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,461
Eh... She didn't go for the mustache.

288
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:12,822
You know, Spike, that mustache has
nothing to do with who you really are.

289
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:15,722
Maybe you should just try being yourself?

290
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:16,777
Or...

291
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:20,942
Maybe the mustache wasn't enough?
Maybe if I had a mustache AND a beard...?

292
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:23,379
Ugh... Not this again.

293
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:27,015
Okay. Imagine me with a nice,
long Fu Manchu-type beard.

294
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:29,816
Or maybe a goatee? Oh, no. A soul patch...

295
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:33,948
