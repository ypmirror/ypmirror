1
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:08,306
Who could that be?
It's still dark!

2
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:14,360
C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider
season's about to start!

3
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:23,448
Oh, where are we?
What's the rush?

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,162
The rush? Don't you remember
what happened last year?

5
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:27,263
Or the year before that?

6
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:29,876
Or pretty much any cider season ever?!

7
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:31,577
Um, well...

8
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:33,544
Pinkie Pie!

9
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:37,676
She always ends up ahead of us in line,
and then they always run out of cider!

10
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:40,425
- I guess I...
- Well not this year!

11
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:42,757
This year, I'm gonna get there before sunrise...

12
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:46,663
...so I can drink all the cider I want,
and laugh when she doesn't get any!

13
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,364
It's the perfect plan.

14
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:51,970
I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while...

15
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:54,750
...drinking it drop by drop in front of her...

16
00:00:55,831 --> 00:01:00,095
Gee Rainbow Dash, it looks like a few
other ponies had the same idea.

17
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:06,456
Oh, gosh Pinkie, I love your new style.

18
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,959
Who are all these ponies?!

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,460
Isn't this great?

20
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,997
I couldn't sleep last night 'cause
I was so excited about cider season...

21
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:15,400
...and I had this brilliant idea
to come gather and camp out...

22
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:17,799
...so I told a few others about it and
they all thought it was a great idea too...

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,830
...and now it's just a big old cider party! Woohoo!

24
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:24,930
Oh gosh, that's a lot of ponies.

25
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,856
Hope they don't run out before you get any.

26
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:04,769

27
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,936
Isn't this exciting, Spike?

28
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:16,975
Opening day of cider season!

29
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:21,226
Yeah! That means it's only thirty
more days to sapphire season!

30
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:27,409
Attention, everypony! Cider
season is now officially open!

31
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:32,152
Sorry everypony!
That's it for today!

32
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:35,761
Surprise, surprise...

33
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:37,309
You ran out again!

34
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,242
Yeah, you always run out!

35
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:41,304
For the record, I don't mind...

36
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,939
Why can't you make enough cider for all of us?

37
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,540
Or at least for me!

38
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:54,598
Hold on everypony, we've done
our best to improve supply this year.

39
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,861
You always say that!

40
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,657
And it's always true.

41
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:02,734
But Apple family cider is made
with love and integrity...

42
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,813
...and only the highest quality apples in Equestria.

43
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:09,007
Sorry, but that recipe takes time.

44
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:16,362
If y'all just be patient, we'll
have plenty more tomorrow.

45
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:19,737
She's right, y'know!
You can't rush perfection!

46
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,462
And this year's batch was perfection!

47
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,063
Uh, Pinkie Pie...

48
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,812
I'll never forget the cider I just drank!

49
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:31,067
It was a moment in time that will never exist again...

50
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,821
What in Equestria is that?

51
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:08,605
Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine,
it's the same in every town

52
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:12,646
Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues,
and not a drop of cider to be found

53
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:16,696
Maybe they're not aware that there's
really no need for this teary despair

54
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:21,682
And the key that they need to solve the
sad cider shortage you and I will share

55
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,238
Well you've got opportunity

56
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,464
In this very community

57

We're the world famous Flim Flam brothers

Travelling salesponies nonpareil

60
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,663
Non-pa what?

61
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:41,418
Nonpareil, that's exactly the reason why, you see

62
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,873
Nopony else in this whole place will give you
such a chance to be where you need to be

63
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:48,117
And that's a new world, with tons of cider

64
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:50,234
Fresh squeezed and ready for drinking

65
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:54,136
More cider than you could drink
in all your days of thinking

66
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,437
I doubt that.

67
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,950
So take this opportunity

68
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,219
In this very community

69
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,380

Travelling salesponies nonpareil

00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:12,595
I suppose by now you're wondering,
about our peculiar mode of transport

73
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:16,456
I say, our mode of locomotion

74
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:20,713
And I suppose by now you're wondering,
where is this promised cider?

75
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,455
Any horse can make a claim
and any pony can do the same

76
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,889
But my brother and I have something
most unique and superb

77
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,832
Unseen at any time in this great new world

78
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,921
And that's opportunity

79
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:36,750
Folks, the one and only, the biggest and the best

80
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:38,085
The unbelievable

81
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:39,186
Unimpeachable

82
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:40,087
Indispensable

83
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,288
I can't believe-able

84
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:47,328
Flim Flam brothers' Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000

85
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:48,729
What d'you say, sister?

86
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,751
Oh, we got opportunity

87
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,978
In this very community

88
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,304
Please Flim, please Flam, help us out of this jam

89
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:58,722
With the Flim Flam brothers'
Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000

90
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:02,329
Young filly, I would be ever so honored if
you might see fit to let my brother and I...

91
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,628
...borrow some of your delicious, and might I add...

92
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,971
...spell-bindingly fragrant apples for
our little demonstration here?

93
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:09,172
Uh, sure, I guess.

94
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:11,550
Opportunity, in our community

95
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:12,651
- Ready Flim?
- Ready Flam.

96
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:13,952
Let's bing-bang zam!

97
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:17,827
And show these thirsty ponies
a world of delectable cider!

98
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:21,676
Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider...

99
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:23,578
Watch closely, my friends!

100
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,599
The fun begins!

101
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,174
Now, here's where the magic happens.

102
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:31,612
Right here in this heaving roiling cider
press boiling guts of the very machine...

103
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:33,772
...those apples plucked fresh are right now as we speak...

104
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:38,375
...being turned into grade-A top-notch five-star
blow-your-horses-off one-of-a-kind cider!

105
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:41,912
Feel free to take a sneak peek!

106
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:44,079
Now wait, you fellas, hold it!

107
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,060
You went and over-sold it!

108
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:49,343
I guarantee that what you have there won't compare

109
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:52,004
For the very most important ingredient

110
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,209
Can't be added or done expedient

111
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,602
And it's quality, friends, Apple Acre's quality and care!

112
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:02,028
Well Granny, I'm glad you brought that up,
my dear, I say I'm glad you brought that up

113
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,134
You see that we are very picky when
it comes to cider if you'll kindly try a cup

114
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:10,494
Yes, sir, yes ma'am this great machine,
it's just the very best

115
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,635
So whaddaya say then, Apples

116
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,784
Care to step into the modern world

117
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:20,088
And put the Super Speedy Cider
Squeezy 6000 to the test?

118
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,020
What do you think, folks?
Do you see what the Apples can't?

119
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:26,363
I see it clear as day!
I know she does! So does he!

120
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:29,120
C'mon Ponyville, you know
what I'm talking about!

121
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,041
We're saying you've got

122
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,442
Opportunity

123
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:34,745
In this very community

124
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:35,962
He's Flim, he's Flam

125
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:38,583
We're the world famous Flim Flam brothers

126
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:45,626
Traveling salesponies nonpareil

127
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:47,415
Yeah!

128
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,703
You got a deal!

129
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:53,947
Not so fast!

130
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:59,746
No way no how that machine matches up
with the care we put in our cider!

131
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:04,076
But if it really does work, we could
make everypony in town happy!

132
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:08,275
I just don't know, y'all. We've
always made cider the same way.

133
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:09,576
Eeyup.

134
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:13,533
We'll sweeten the deal.
You supply the apples...

135
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:17,568
We supply the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.

136
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,834
Then we split those sweet sweet profits...

137
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,809
Seventy five...
- Twenty five.

138
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,510
Deal!

139
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,835
Hold on, who gets the seventy five?

140
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,620
Why us, naturally.

141
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:30,833
And, we'll throw in the magic
to power the machine for free.

142
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,131
Cider sales keep our business
afloat through the winter.

143
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:37,796
We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.

144
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:40,318
So? What'll it be?

145
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,870
No deal.

146
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:46,010
Very well, if you refuse our
generous offer to be partners...

147
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,414
...then we'll just have to be competitors.

148
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:50,157
You wouldn't dare.

149
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:51,258
Oh no?

150
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,882
Don't you worry, everypony!
There'll be plenty of cider for all of you!

151
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:01,219
Once we drive Sweet Apple Acres out of business.

152
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,693
Still worried about Flim and Flam?

153
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:23,295
Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.

154
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:24,654
I'm not so sure.

155
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:27,974
They sounded mighty serious when they
threatened to run us out of business.

156
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,246
That's it! Last cup!

157
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:32,595
Oh for Pete's sake!

158
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:35,059
C'mon back tomorrow, everypony!

159
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,760
*Tomorrow?*

160
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:47,493
What seems to be the problem here?

161
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:50,611
Oh my oh my, out of cider again?

162
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:54,923
What have we here?
Who'd like a cup?

163
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:05,066
Don't worry, everypony, we've got the Super Speedy
Cider Squeezy 6000 to make more in an instant!

164
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:10,990
You can't sell that cider!

165
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,452
That's made from Apple family apples!

166
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:17,231
Is this some kind of cruel joke?

167
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:21,024
Don't worry, everypony, there are
plenty of apples in Equestria.

168
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:25,220
We'll find some others and make more
cider than all of Ponyville can drink!

169
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:29,304
We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine!

170
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:36,476
Now, it ain't about the speed,
young'un, it's about quality.

171
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,987
Who cares how good the cider is,
if I never get to drink any?

172
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:44,947
Oh, look at these poor, dissatisfied ponies.

173
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:47,950
Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country!

174
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,929
Our cider speaks for itself!

175
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,929
Let's put it to the test!

176
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,411
Anywhere, anytime!

177
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,483
Well, that's enough, now.

178
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:04,108
With our machine, we can make enough cider
in one hour to satisfy this entire town!

179
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,421
We'll do it in 45 minutes!

180
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,468
Easy, Apple Bloom, easy.

181
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:14,884
What's the matter, Granny Smith? Chicken?

182
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:17,388
What did you call me, sonny?

183
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:21,268
If you're so confident in your cider,
then what's the problem?

184
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:23,783
Tomorrow mornin', right here!

185
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,940
But I'm afraid we haven't any... apples.

186
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:30,353
You can use our south field...

187
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:33,836
...and it'd be worth it to teach you
all a thing or two about cider making!

188
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,743
Excellent, we have a bet.

189
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:41,447
Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour,
wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville.

190
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:50,385
And after we beat ya, I don't never want to
see you bimbahoozalers around here again!

191
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,644
Until... tomorrow.

192
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:59,869
Don't worry, Applejack,
I know you'll win tomorrow!

193
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,978
We'd better, 'cause if we don't,
we're gonna lose our farm!

194
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:20,660
Applejack? Are you sure
this is such a good idea?

195
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:24,446
Me and the family are...
a hundred percent confident...

196
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:26,932
...in our cider making capabilities.

197
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:30,750
And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken.

198
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:34,145
Attention everypony!

199
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,560
Well, good luck.

200
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:38,104
Thanks Twilight.

201
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:40,515
We'll need it.

202
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,716
The teams have one hour to produce
as much cider as they can.

203
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:47,119
After which, the barrels will be counted...

204
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,267
...and the winner will be named the
sole cider provider for all of Ponyville!

205
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,934
Are both teams ready?

206
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,286
Ready!

207
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,740
Ready!

208
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:06,272
Then let's...

209
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,303
...go!

210
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:26,753
Bad 'un. Good 'un!
Bad 'un...

211
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,843
Great job, y'all!
We've already filled an entire barrel!

212
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,505
I'll bet you those guys don't even have...

213
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,825
C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus!

214
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:09,666
We gotta forget those guys if we're
gonna have a chance of winnin'!

215
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:14,107
Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny,
we're fallin' behind!

216
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,465
Good 'un... bad 'un...

217
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,738
Rest when it's over, Big Macintosh!

218
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,852
Ride! Ride!

219
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,901
This is just dreadful.

220
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:34,286
Even at top speed, the Apples are only
making one barrel to the twins' three!

221
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:44,224
Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members
allowed to help in the competition?

222
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,821
Well, I'm not sure...

223
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:51,531
Flim, Flam, would you object to
honorary family members helping?

224
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,637
Are you kidding?

225
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:57,035
We don't care if the whole
kingdom of Canterlot helps.

226
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,117
It's a lost cause.

227
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:03,837
I guess it's okay.
Applejack? What do you think?

228
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:08,163
I think I'd love to have the
rest of my family helpin' out.

229
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,011
All right!

230
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:16,804
Okay everypony, we're not gonna let those
smooth talkers take our friend's farm.

231
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:18,005
Yeah!

232
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:21,337
Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees.

233
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:22,338
Got it.

234
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,064
Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail.

235
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,869
Yes sir, ma'am, sir!

236
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,126
Rarity, you've got a discerning eye.

237
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:31,458
Help Granny Smith at the quality control station.

238
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:32,459
Of course.

239
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Rainbow Dash, do you think you
can help Big Macintosh press?

240
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,661
In my sleep!

241
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,234
Alright everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!

242
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:41,635
All right!

243
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:49,361
Over there, Apple Bloom!
Don't miss them!

244
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,214
Right behind you, Pinkie Pie!

245
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,342
Good 'un, bad 'un, bad 'un, good 'un...

246
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:59,553
Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely...

247
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:11,235
Based on these figures, we're making
five barrels for every three of theirs!

248
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:15,665
Keep it up, everypony!
We're back in this!

249
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,738
Come on, brother, we've gotta pick up the pace!

250
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,912
Right, double the power!

251
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,306
We gotta try something else!

252
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:37,216
I've got it, brother of mine.

253
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,691
Well done, Flam!
We're at top productivity!

254
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:49,906
C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!

255
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:53,411
We don't have time for quality control,
if we wanna win this thing!

256
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:59,310
Get back, you!
One bad apple spoils the bunch!

257
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,961
Applejack, help me!

258
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:03,726
There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!

259
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,550
We'll just have to work harder!

260
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,991
C'mon, everypony!

261
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:10,105
All right then, double time!

262
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,668
Time's up!

263
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,354
I'm proud of you, Applejack.

264
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:46,655
Thanks.

265
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:51,461
Integrity like that, will always be... rewarded.

266
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,302
Flim and Flam win!

267
00:18:57,321 --> 00:19:00,145
We... lost?

268
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,976
Too bad, Apples.

269
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:08,567
Guess you'll just have to find a new line of work
that doesn't match your names quite so... perfectly.

270
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:12,521
Now should we tear down all these tacky
old buildings and put up new ones, brother?

271
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:14,711
I don't see why not, brother.

272
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:18,408
After all, this isn't Sweet Apple Acres anymore.

273
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:22,569
How about 'Flim Flam Fields'?

274
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,417
I ought to press you into jerk cider!

275
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:29,043
No, Rainbow Dash.
A deal's a deal.

276
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:34,065
Congratulations to y'all.

277
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:38,509
The cider business in Ponyville... is yours.

278
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,224
C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things.

279
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:48,289
Fear not, everypony. There's more
than enough cider to go around.

280
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,663
Go ahead, everypony.

281
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:57,581
Go on, y'all. It's okay.

282
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:05,219
Drink up, Ponyville!
Down the hatch!

283
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,985
I can't get the taste off my tongue!

284
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,787
Mine's got rocks in it.

285
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:16,847
I wouldn't pay one cent for this dreck!

286
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,938
You wouldn't pay even one cent?

287
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:20,939
No!

288
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:25,453
How about two cups for one cent?

289
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:26,454
No!

290
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,785
Two bits for a barrel?

291
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:30,986
No!

292
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,906
It looks like we've encountered a slight...

293
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:37,201
...problem here, in Ponyville.

294
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,013
Nopony wants our product. Next town?

295
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,114
Next town.

296
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:44,035
- Let's go, Flim!
- Let's go, Flam!

297
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,498
They're gone.

298
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,670
That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!

299
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:57,141
Plus we can have high quality Apple family cider!

300
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,165
Because of this silly competition...

301
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,071
...we've made enough of our
cider for the whole town!

302
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,205
"Dear Princess Celestia..."

303
00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:10,758
"...I wanted to share my thoughts with you. "

304
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:15,771
"I didn't learn anythin'!
I was right all along!"

305
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:20,482
"If you take your time to do things the
right way, your work will speak for itself."

306
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:24,799
"Sure, I could tell you I learned something about
how my friends are always there to help me..."

307
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,711
"...and I can count on them no matter what..."

308
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:30,349
"...but truth is, I knew that already too."
