falling apart like this.

342
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:01,240
I can't believe I was
arguing with you so much

343
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,740
that I tore the
wheel right off the raft.

myself at all.

your fault.

My stubborn streak got a
holda me somethin' fierce.

347
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,505
I shoulda let you take the
wheel long before that.

348
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,047
It was my fault the
map got all wet.

I was the pony..

350
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:21,691
Now now, Big Mac, you
gotta know we forgive you

351
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:24,214
for packin' the jalopy so
much that it collapsed.

352
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,347
You was just eager to please
Pinkie Pie like the rest of us.

353
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:31,717
Everypony, I think we have
to let Pinkie Pie know

354
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:34,085
that even if she does
discover that she's an Apple,

355
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:37,313
she does not have to feel
obliged to consider herself one.

356
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,525
Sure as apple sauce.

How can you say that?

00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:50,277
We started out as one big

361
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:52,284
Yeah! NOW look at you!

pretty good point.
