1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,396
Yeah!

2
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:17,082
Who?

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,102
Oh. It's you, Owloysius.
Come on! Try and keep up.

4
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:39,402
Winona? I mean...

5
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,830
Winona's head?

6
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:44,462
Um... Is this weird or is it just me?

7
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,446
Angel?! Gummy?!

8
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:54,684
Okay. This is officially beyond weird now
and moved right on down to freakytown.

9
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:07,401
Sincerest apologies, Rainbow,
if our pets were bothering you.

10
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:09,472
Say you're sorry, Opal.

11
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:11,928
She's sorry.

12
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,984
What are you all doing out here?

13
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:18,335
Why, we always round up our critters for
our regular pony pet playdate in this park.

14
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:19,774
Uh... You do?

15
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,737
Same time every week.

16
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:25,871
I thought you knew.
You didn't know? She didn't know?

17
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:29,827
Well, we initially planned on inviting
Rainbow, of course, except...

18
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:31,730
We were totally gonna
invite you, Rainbow.

19
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:33,476
Then Twilight remembered that
you don't even have a pet.

20
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:35,965
And Rarity remembered that you really
like taking naps in the afternoon.

21
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:38,407
So Applejack figured you wouldn't
missing out on anything anyway.

22
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,998
And Fluttershy and I nodded
our heads in agreement like this.

23
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:43,962
Oh... Please don't be mad at us.

24
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,145
Oh... I'm not mad.

25
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:49,538
You all are right. Not much point
of a pony pet playdate for me...

26
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,541
...if I'm a pony without a pet, right?

27
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,837
Exactly.

28
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,605
So, if'n you'll excuse us...

29
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:08,538
Hey! Now wait a minute.

30
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:12,476
Just because I don't have a pet now
doesn't mean I never want a pet.

31
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:16,474
Oh! Oh, really?
You really want a pet? Really?

32
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,900
Cause I've got so many
wonderful choices at my house.

33
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:20,959
Oh, and I know you'll just love them.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,440
And they'll love you! Oh!

35
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:25,046
And you'll be best friends
forever and ever!

36
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:36,295
<i>Now, Rainbow, my dear,
I cannot express my delight.</i>

37
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,931
<i>It's abundantly clear
That somewhere round here</i>

38
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,466
<i>Is the pet that will suit you just right.</i>

39
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:45,742
<i>I can't wait to get started,
but first let me set a few rules.</i>

40
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:48,146
<i>It's of utmost importance
the pet that I get</i>

41
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:50,380
<i>Is something that's awesome and cool.</i>

42
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:52,583
Awesome and cool. Got it!

43
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:56,995
<i>I have so many wonderful choices,
just wait, you will see.</i>

44
00:03:56,996 --> 00:04:01,094
<i>I need something real fast like a bullet
to keep up with me.</i>

45
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:06,493
<i>Sure! How 'bout a bunny?
They're cutesy and wootsy and quick as can be.</i>

46
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:09,094
"Cutesy"? "Wootsy"?
Have you even met me?

47
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:13,327
<i>Rainbow, have faith!
You see, I will bet you.</i>

48
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,826
<i>Somewhere round here
is the pet that will get you.</i>

49
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:17,663
Come on, the sky is the limit.

50
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:20,052
Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.

51
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:23,401
Really? Because I think this wittle puddy
tat has your name written all over it.

52
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:27,308
Yes, he does! Aw, look, he likes you.

53
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,712
Pass.

54
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:32,701
<i>I have so many wonderful choices
for you to decide.</i>

55
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:35,942
<i>There are otters and seals
with massive appeal...</i>

56
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,767
Otters and seals do not fly.

57
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,899
Maybe not, but I've seen
this particular seal...

58
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,562
...catch ten feet of air
when he breaches the water.

59
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,947
That's it. I'm outta here.

60
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:50,356
<i>Wait! There must be a pet here,
that will fit that ticket.</i>

61
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,937
<i>How 'bout a ladybug or a cute cricket?</i>

62
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,736
Bigger! And cooler!

63
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:56,894
Bigger. Cooler. Right.

64
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:59,515
<i>I've got just the thing in that tree. Dash...</i>

65
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:03,881
<i>Meet your new fabulous pet squirrelee!</i>

66
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:05,384
It's just a squirrel.

67
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:08,940
Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!

68
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,507
Yeah... So, like I was saying...

69
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:16,945
<i>Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it.</i>

70
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:20,304
<i>I need a pet to keep up with me.</i>

71
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:24,147
<i>Something awesome, something flying...</i>

72
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:27,580
<i>...with coolness that defies gravity!</i>

73
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,989
I'm sensing you want
an animal that can fly.

74
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,830
You think?

75
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:35,419
<i>I have plenty of wonderful
creatures who soar in the sky.</i>

76
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,878
<i>Like a sweet hummingbird
or a giant monarch butterfly.</i>

77
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,454
Better. But cooler.

78
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:44,830
<i>I see. How 'bout an owl?
Or a wasp, or a toucan?</i>

79
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,254
<i>There's so many wonderful
creatures the likes of that.</i>

80
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:53,581
<i>There are falcons and eagles.
They are both quite regal.</i>

81
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:56,509
<i>Or perhaps what you need
is a dark and mysterious bat?</i>

82
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,147
Now you're talking!

83
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,017
But instead of just one standout
now that's too many.

84
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:06,178
<i>So many choices
and such riches a plenty.</i>

85
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,797
Not a bad problem to have,
if you ask me.

86
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:12,107
<i>The bat would be awesome,
but the wasp I'm digging too.</i>

87
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:15,212
<i>You have something
in a yellow striped bat?</i>

88
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:15,985
No.

89
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:19,579
<i>I've got a hot pink flamingo
Just dying to meet you.</i>

90
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,666
<i>What to do? What to do?</i>

91
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,771
<i>A prize! That's it!
There's really just one way...</i>

92
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:30,071
<i>...to find out which animal's best.</i>

93
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:34,505
<i>Hold a contest of speed,
agility and guts...</i>

94
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:39,866
<i>...that will put each pet to the test!</i>

95
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,965
<i>Don't forget style,
that should be considered.</i>

96
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,813
<i>Then we'll know for sure
who's best of the litter.</i>

97
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:46,890
<i>-The one who's as awesome as cool...
-...just like me!</i>

98
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:50,969
<i>Can't settle for less, cause I'm the best,
so a contest we will see!</i>

99
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:57,247
<i>Who's the number one greatest,
perfectest pet in the world for me!</i>

100
00:06:57,248 --> 00:07:02,843
<i>May the race begin!</i>

101
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:05,216
And may the best pet win!

102
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:13,992
Shh...!

103
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,351
So, you all think you've got what
it takes to be my pet, do ya?

104
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,948
Well, we'll just see about that.

105
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,366
If any of you don't think
you can handle it...

106
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,299
...bow out now before you humiliate
yourself in front of your peers.

107
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,821
This competition isn't for the weak.

108
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:35,924
You'd better be prepared
to step up your game!

109
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,574
YOU CALL THAT FLAPPING?!

110
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,120
That's better.

111
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:42,680
There's only room on team
just for one of you...

112
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:46,259
...and my future pet needs to
be able to take it to the extreme.

113
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:48,619
Any questions?

114
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:53,073
I got one. Does she understand
what a pet really needs?

115
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:56,521
Yeah. Like care and attention.
Love and affection.

116
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:59,353
Ugh! And breath mints!

117
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,196
Now you just pay attention
and try your best and...

118
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,593
Seriously, Fluttershy. The turtle?

119
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,743
What did you bring that thing here for?

120
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:10,826
Technically he's a tortoise.

121
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:13,500
And he's always dreamed
of being somepony's pet.

122
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:16,031
He just wants a chance to compete.
He won't get in the way.

123
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:18,166
You won't even know he's here.

124
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,607
No.

125
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,959
Oh. Just let him try.

126
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,906
But there's no way
he can possibly keep up.

127
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,268
Look at 'im.

128
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:35,091
-It won't hurt to let him try.
-But...

129
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:37,543
Just let him try!

130
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,260
Uh. Fine.

131
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,652
But don't say I didn't warn you!

132
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,882
This isn't a game, you know.

133
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:48,945
All right. Now these games
will determine which one of you...

134
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,078
...has the most important qualities
I'm looking for in a pet.

135
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,275
Speed!

136
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,714
Agility!

137
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,551
Guts!

138
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:01,823
Style!

139
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,694
Coolness!

140
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:05,412
Awesomeness!

141
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,871
And radicalness!

142
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:09,700
Aren't those all the same thing?

143
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,457
You would think that, Twilight.

144
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,684
And that's why you would
never qualify to be my pet.

145
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,618
Speed!

146
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:20,222
On your marks...

147
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:23,184
Get set...

148
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:31,907
Sorta speedy.

149
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:32,802
Not speedy.

150
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,250
Pretty speedy.

151
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:35,961
Could be more speedy.

152
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:42,602
Yeah! That's speed!

153
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:50,979
That's just sad.

154
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,126
Agility!

155
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:56,009
Sorta agile.

156
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:58,718
Not agile.

157
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,290
Pretty agile.

158
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:02,912
Could be more agile.

159
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:11,747
Wanna know the opposite
of agility? That.

160
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:21,828
Yeah, baby! Now that's
what I call agility!

161
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,219
Don't leave me hangin'!

162
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,094
I'm gonna have to shave a point
off your score for that.

163
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:40,800
Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and
get Opal's favorite toy away from her?

164
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:02,091
Now that takes guts!

165
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,305
Style.

166
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,432
Any pet of mine's gotta look good.

167
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,623
'Cause you gotta make me look good.

168
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,644
Coolness.

169
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:27,330
Sorta cool.

170
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:29,151
Not cool.

171
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:31,170
Pretty cool.

172
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:33,321
Could be cooler.

173
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:36,154
Not what I had in mind.

174
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:40,767
I can't hear you!

175
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,225
Now that's a cool sound!

176
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,804
Sorta awesome.

177
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,871
Not awesome.

178
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,826
Could be more awesome.

179
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:04,662
Hohoho yeah! That is awesome!

180
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:09,028
Uh... You did that already.

181
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,034
That's pretty much all you can do, huh?

182
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,371
Whoa...

183
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:36,098
That was truly awesome!

184
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,316
But I'm afraid this is
the radicalness competition, so...

185
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,106
...I'm gonna have to
take some points off.

186
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:51,476
Listen, turtle...

187
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:53,341
-Tortoise!
-Whatever!

188
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:56,104
You had your fun, but I think
you and I both know...

189
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:58,249
...who made the cut and who didn't.

190
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:05,401
You didn't.

191
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,282
I mean... A for effort and everything...

192
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:13,971
You gave it your best shot.

193
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:16,697
Maybe I've got a gold star sticker
around here somewhere you can have.

194
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:20,656
But seriously, go home.
You're starting to creep me out.

195
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,489
So... Anyway...

196
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,580
You're all outstanding competitors.

197
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,934
But there can be only one of you,
who's number one.

198
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:38,582
So the final, tie-breaking
contest is going to be...

199
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,665
(Pause for dramatic effect)

200
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,035
A race against...

201
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,034
...ME!

202
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,057
...through Ghastly Gorge!

203
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,554
DUN DUN DUUUN!

204
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:51,703
Gesundheit.

205
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:57,583
Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary.

206
00:13:57,584 --> 00:13:58,664
It's fun!

207
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:01,788
I've flown though it
a million times myself...

208
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:04,769
...so obviously I'll be
at the front of the pack.

209
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,376
But whichever of you make it
across the finish line with me...

210
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:10,352
...will have proven
he can keep up with me...

211
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:15,309
...and will have earned the honor
(and glory) of getting to be my pet.

212
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,183
Ready?

213
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:18,257
...setgo!

214
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:26,153
Try to keep up!

215
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,963
Can't catch me!

216
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,689
♪♪♪♪♪

217
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,265
Come on, slowpokes!

218
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:06,887
You wanna win, doncha?

219
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:27,887
;-P

220
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,889
Oh! I forgot to tell you!

221
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,258
Watch out for the quarray eels.

222
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:44,386
They don't like you when
you get too close to their nests.

223
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:45,740
Like this.

224
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:50,849
:-O

225
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,766
Easy-peasy, one too greasy.

226
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,011
Right, guys?

227
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:19,809
AVALANCHE!

228
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:22,215
Hey!

229
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:36,133
Come on...

230
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:39,299
No! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me!

231
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,564
I'm the one who's supposed to win!

232
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,843
I don't wanna end up stuck here...

233
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:44,739
...forever.

234
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,678
Oh no. Nonono. Thi...
This can't be happening.

235
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,104
Forever is way too long
to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge.

236
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,046
I mean... it's like...

237
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,211
...forever!

238
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:58,994
SOMEPONY! ANYPONY! HELP ME!!!

239
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,695
Woohoo!

240
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:16,482
My prayers have been answered!

241
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:18,035
Oh, thankyouthankyouthank...

242
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:19,706
YOU?!

243
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,917
Oh no!

244
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:24,418
Now I'm not only gonna
be stuck here forever...

245
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,789
...I'm gonna be stuck here forever with
the most annoying turtle in the world!

246
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,411
I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!

247
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,235
Something's not right here.

248
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:04,799
Where's Rainbow Dash?

249
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,845
Great gallopin' galoshes!

250
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:08,640
There's been an avalanche in there!

251
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,326
Rainbow!

252
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:13,569
Wait! Look!

253
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,029
It's the turtle!

254
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,009
-Tortoise!
-Whatever.

255
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,714
And he's carrying something on his back.

256
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:21,842
It's Rainbow Dash!
It's her! It's Rainbow!

257
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:30,383
Maybe we'd better go meet them halfway.

258
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,865
Way to go, little guy.

259
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:46,514
Oh, thank goodness
you're not hurt, Rainbow.

260
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,379
Just my pride.

261
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,063
I certainly hope all of this
dreadful dust was worth it...

262
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,036
It sure was if'n it means
Rainbow gets to have...

263
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:58,685
...her own little critter, just like
the rest of us, from now on.

264
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:02,267
Uh... thanks.

265
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:05,069
What you did... I owe you one.

266
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:09,587
Rainbow! Your new pet is
over here waiting for you!

267
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:19,197
Oh. Right. Yeah. That.

268
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:20,821
What's the matter?

269
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:22,787
You got your perfect pet, right?

270
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,861
The best of the best,
like you wanted, remember?

271
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:28,095
It can fly and it's not a squirrel.

272
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,449
Should we sing about it again?

273
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,903
A falcon sure looks
good on you, Rainbow.

274
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:39,676
Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of.

275
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:43,463
A falcon sure does look cool.

276
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:46,985
He's absolutely everything
I wanted in a pet.

277
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:49,887
Yay?

278
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:54,817
But I said whoever crosses the finish
line *with me* gets to be my pet.

279
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,777
You did! You did say that!

280
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,303
She did say that! That was the rule!

281
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:03,003
And the only racer, who crossed
the finish line with me...

282
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:06,467
...was the one, who stopped
to save me when I needed help.

283
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,024
The tortoise!

284
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,075
But what about the...?

285
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:20,912
Would you look at that.

286
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:23,026
He even smiles slow.

287
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,847
Spike, take a letter.

288
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:31,529
"Dear Princess Celestia."

289
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,899
"I used to think that the most important
traits to look for in a pet..."

290
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,355
"...or any best friend, were all
physical, competitive abilities."

291
00:20:38,886 --> 00:20:42,383
"But now I can see how short-sighted
and shallow that was."

292
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:46,272
"Today I learned what the most
important quality really is."

293
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:50,238
"A certain kind of spirit.
A stick-to-it-iveness."

294
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:54,936
"A never-give-up, can-do attitude,
that's the mark of a real winner."

295
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,846
"And this tortoise has it."

296
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:58,018
Tenacity.

297
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:58,989
Gesundheit.

298
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,921
"You just can't stop that little guy."

299
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,358
He's like a... like a...

300
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,297
...tank!

301
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:08,003
But Rainbow. You didn't want
a pet that couldn't fly...

302
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:11,219
...because it would keep you grounded
and hold you back, remember?

303
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:25,987
Come on, Tank! We're gonna be late
for our very first pony pet playdate!

304
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:36,403
