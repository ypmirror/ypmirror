1
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:04,893
Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me.

2
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:08,878
That there's the biggest bumper crop
a' apples I've ever laid eyes on.

3
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:13,990
Yep. Too big for you to handle on your own.

4
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:17,393
Come on, big brother!
You need to rest up and get yourself better.

5
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:20,067
I haven't met an apple orchard yet,
that I can't handle.

6
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,089
Oops. Sorry.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,887
I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,623
Bitin' off more than you can chew
is just what I'm afraid of.

9
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:32,709
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin'
promises my legs can't keep?

10
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:33,572
Yep.

11
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:37,828
Why of all the... This is your
sister Applejack, remember?

12
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:41,212
The loyalest of friends and
the most dependable of ponies!

13
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:48,447
But still only one pony. And one pony plus
hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to...

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,524
Don't you use your fancy
mathematics to muddle the issue!

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,053
I said I can handle this harvest
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

16
00:00:55,599 --> 00:01:01,356
I'm gonna get every last apple out of those
trees this Applebuck Season all by myself!

17
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:48,366
Well, I better get kickin'. These apples
aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees.

18
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:51,278
Hey!

19
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,850
Oh no!

20
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,070
STAMPEDE!

21
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:20,892
Heeey...! Thiiis maaakes myyy
voooice sooound siiilly!

22
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,186
Pinkie Pie! Are you crazy?! Run!

23
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,182
Everypony calm down!
There is no need to panic!

24
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:30,526
But Mayor! What ever shall we do?

25
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,111
Look there!

26
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:36,118
YEEHAW!

27
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:39,762
Other side, Winona!

28
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,430
Put 'em up, girl!

29
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,915
This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen!

30
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,705
Come on, little doggie! Herd!

31
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,997
Winona! Put 'em up!

32
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,236
Gotcha!

33
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:14,347
Attagirl!

34
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:30,657
Now what was that all about?

35
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,791
Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack.

36
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:41,574
But Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes.

37
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:45,765
And it just gave us all
the willies, don't you know?

38
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:51,437
I completely understand. Just next time,
try and steer clear o' Ponyville.

39
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:55,657
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!

40
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:05,443
Ride 'em, cowpony!

41
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,956
Applejack was just... just...

42
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,569
Appletastic!

43
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:15,475
Exactly! We must do something to thank
Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.

44
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:16,805
I know!

45
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:18,918
A party!

46
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:24,208
-We all ready?
-Just one last thing.

47
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,257
Now we're ready.

48
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,628
-Is Applejack all set?
-Actually, I haven't seen her all week.

49
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:37,080
Not since the stampede.

50
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:40,945
But she'll be here for sure.
Applejack is never late!

51
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,046
Welcome, everypony!
Today we are here to honor...

52
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:59,543
...a pony we can always count on
to help in matters great and small.

53
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:05,343
-A pony, whose contributions to...
-Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there?!

54
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:07,047
What an athlete!

55
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,759
This week she's gonna help
me with my new flying trick!

56
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,470
And I know it's gonna be SO AWESOME!

57
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,429
Exactly! And...

58
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,969
This week, I get to run Sugarcube
Corner for the first time!

59
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:20,235
What does that have to do with Applejack?

60
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:25,571
Oh! Applejack, one of the best
bakers ever, is gonna help me!

61
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,884
Applejack makes everything great.
So free samples for everypony!

62
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:35,395
Okay, that's great. Now if I could just
make a point without being inter...

63
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:37,081
-Twilight...
-...rupted.

64
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:41,204
Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just
wanted to mention that Applejack...

65
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:44,268
...is also helping me this week
with the official bunny census...

66
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:47,530
...where we count up all the new baby
bunnies that were born this season.

67
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:51,071
She's gonna help gather them
using her wonderful herding skills.

68
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,021
Anyone else? Anyone?

69
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:57,357
No?

70
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:01,281
Well then, as I was trying to say...

71
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:05,501
ARGH! Never mind!

72
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,509
And so, with no further ado...

73
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:14,592
...it is my privilege to give the prized Pony of
Ponyville award to our beloved guest of honor...

74
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:18,932
...a pony of the utmost trustworthiness,
reliability and integrity...

75
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:23,659
...Ponyville's most capable and
dependable friend: Applejack!

76
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:29,003
...way to go, Applejack,
that was awesome! I mean...

77
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:38,626
Awkward.

78
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,215
I'm here! I'm here!

79
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,841
Sorry, I'm late. Whoah... I was just...

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,552
Did I hurt your tail...?

81
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:55,193
Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for
this here... award thingy.

82
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:59,528
It's so bright and shinin'.

83
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:03,492
I sure do look funny here.

84
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:15,942
Oookay. Well, thank you, Applejack, for
saving us from that scary stampede.

85
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:18,391
And always being there for everypony.

86
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:24,439
Yeah. I like helpin'
the ponyfolks and... and stuff...

87
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,378
Yeah! Thanks!

88
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,674
Was it just me or did Applejack seem a little...

89
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,848
-Tired?
-Dizzy?
-Messy?

90
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:50,023
Well, did you see her mane?

91
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,939
She seemed fine to me!

92
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:15,350
What on Earth is that pony doing?

93
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:17,185
Whoops.

94
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:18,572
Hey Applejack!

95
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:24,487
Applejack! Applejack!

96
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,320
APPLEJACK!

97
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,637
-Howdy Twilight?
-What is all this?

98
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:37,601
It's Applebuck Season.

99
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,738
Apple-what Season?

100
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:47,121
It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time.

101
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,249
We gather all the apples from
the trees, so we can sell 'em.

102
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:52,457
But why are you doing it all alone?

103
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,493
'Cos Big Macintosh hurt himself.

104
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:58,533
What about all those relatives I've met when
I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?

105
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:02,103
They were just here
for the Apple family reunion.

106
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:06,422
They actually live all over Equestria and
are busy harvestin' their own orchards.

107
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:08,574
So... I'm on my own.

108
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,719
...which means, I should really get back to work.

109
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:18,860
Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?

110
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:19,985
Fine.

111
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:24,259
-Could you step aside, Twilight?
-I just did.

112
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,969
Applejack. You don't look so good.

113
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:32,068
Yeah... don't any o' you three worry
none, I'm just fine and dandy.

114
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:37,177
Do you want some help?

115
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:40,494
Help? No way, no how.

116
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:42,805
But there's no way you can
do it all on your own.

117
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:46,147
-Is that a challenge?
-Um... No?

118
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,929
Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it!

119
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:53,775
Now if you'll excuuuse me...
I've got apples to buck.

120
00:09:58,689 --> 00:09:59,897
There you are!

121
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:02,893
I'm a might sorry, Rainbow.

122
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:07,049
I was busy applebuckin' and I guess I...
I closed my eyes for a second and...

123
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,139
...when I woke up, I was late.
Now, what's this new trick of yours?

124
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,996
-See this contraption?
-Uh.. Yeah?

125
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:18,568
Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then
you're gonna jump down from that platform...

126
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:23,556
...launching me into the air faster than I could
take off on my own. Once I'm in the air...

127
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:28,780
...I'm gonna do some AMAZING flips and spins
that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.

128
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:31,110
Isn't that a mite dangerous?

129
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,947
Not for a pony who can fly!

130
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,424
Well, alrighty then!

131
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:44,565
Oh my!

132
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:48,090
Ready? One... two... THREE!

133
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,348
Um... maybe I wasn't clear.
You're supposed to land *on* the other end.

134
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,012
Got it!

135
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:04,321
Applejack, what a hay is going on?

136
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:07,902
I mean, I though I was working
with Ponyville's best athlete!

137
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,348
You are!

138
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,421
I'm okay! Really! I have an idea!

139
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:14,713
Watch this!

140
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:18,984
Ta-da!

141
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:21,582
Oh... Maybe not.

142
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:25,111
Okay, one more try!
I'm sure to get it this time.

143
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,442
Here I go!

144
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:41,251
Wait, Applejaaaaack...!

145
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,632
You're welcome!

146
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:50,638
Can I help you?

147
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:55,444
I think somepony else needs your help.

148
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,539
-Applejack?
-Yep.

149
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,428
Applejack, can we talk?

150
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,876
Applejack, can we talk?

151
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:17,401
CAN BEES SQUAWK?! I DON'T THINK SO!

152
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,176
No! Can we talk?

153
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:22,417
TWENTY STALKS?! BEAN OR CELERY?!

154
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,045
No! I need to talk to you!

155
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:29,188
YOU NEED TO WALK TO THE ZOO?!
WELL, WHO'S STOPPIN' YOU?!

156
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:31,060
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!

157
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:35,579
OH! WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?!
WHAT'S YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?!

158
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,185
RAINBOW DASH DROPPED
IN TO SEE ME TODAY!

159
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:40,567
THAT'S QUITE NEIGHBORLY OF HER!

160
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,059
YES, EXCEPT THAT SHE
CRASHED ONTO MY BALCONY...

161
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,037
...AFTER YOU LAUNCHED
HER INTO THE AIR!

162
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,699
Oh, yeah. I wasn't feelin'
quite myself this morning.

163
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:52,655
Because you're working too
hard and you need help!

164
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,088
WHAT?! KELP?!

165
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:56,927
I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed!

166
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:59,165
HELP!!! YOU NEED HELP!!!

167
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:05,700
Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you...
to everypony, that I can do this on my own!

168
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:06,925
Ow!

169
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,995
Now if you'll excuuuse me, I've
gotta go help Pinkie Pie!

170
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:20,247
Now, Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking
the muffins and running the store this afternoon?

171
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:22,448
Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake!

172
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:26,932
Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help
me out. Why, she's the best baker ever!

173
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,344
Right, Applejack?

174
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:33,251
No, you're not the best baker ever?

175
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,167
What?! On, no!

176
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:41,080
I mean... Don't you fret. I can bake anything
from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.

177
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,379
All right. Well, see you later, girls!

178
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:48,775
Stop with the shakin'! It's time to get bakin'!

179
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:53,616
Alrighty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs.
Can you get me some chocolate chips?

180
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:56,159
W... What was that?

181
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,912
Chocolate chips!

182
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,725
Chips... Got it!

183
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:06,190
Tater chips. All salty and dry.
Okie dokie.

184
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:08,446
What next?

185
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,287
Baking soda!

186
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,071
Soda... Perfect! That'll get
the tater chips nice and wet.

187
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,244
Now what?

188
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:19,504
A cup of flour!

189
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,760
A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour.
A cup o' sour, comin' up.

190
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:30,534
-Anything else, Pinkie?
-One last thing. Wheat germ!

191
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:35,690
Wheat worms...? Oh! That must be
fancy talk for earthworms!

192
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:42,478
Now that's gonna be delicious!

193
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:44,807
If you say so...

194
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,497
Free Muffin Sample Spectacular!

195
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:58,174
Yeah! Muffin spectacles!
Get 'em while they're hot!

196
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,310
We came as soon as we heard!

197
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,977
Oh, thank you, Twilight.
We need all the help we can get.

198
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,737
Oh no! What happened?

199
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,207
It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.

200
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:20,532
No... Not baked goods... Baked bads...!

201
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,222
Applejack!

202
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:25,431
Want one?

203
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,484
Applejack? We need to talk.

204
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,835
Oh. It's you, Twilight.

205
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:51,642
I know what you're gonna say,
but the answer is still no.

206
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:54,574
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.

207
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:58,791
Hardy har... No, I don't!

208
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:03,024
-Here. Let me help.
-Help?! No thanks!

209
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,591
A little more... Little...

210
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:10,990
There.

211
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:16,504
I'll prove that this apple
can handle these apples.

212
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:21,021
Come on... apples... Fall off!

213
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:23,926
AJ... I think you're beating a dead...

214
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:25,628
...tree.

215
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:28,368
I knew that.

216
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,581
Actually, Applejack, I had something
else to talk to you about.

217
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,648
I just came back from
Ponyville urgent care and...

218
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:37,070
You know? I'm a little busy to
get lectured right now, Twilight.

219
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:38,603
But if you'd just let me help...

220
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,536
No no NO!

221
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:47,517
How many times do I gotta say it?
I don't need no help from nopony!

222
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:51,015
That pony is stubborn as a mule!

223
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:54,442
-No offense...
-None taken.

224
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,520
Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your
herding skills for the annual rabbit round up.

225
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:04,468
Why are we doing this?

226
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:07,482
Well, lots of new baby
bunnies have been born...

227
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:10,209
...so it's my job to get a count
of all the new families.

228
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,267
Fine. Can we just get on with it?

229
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:16,434
Certainly. But remember, these are
bunnies we're dealing with, not cows.

230
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,864
They are timid bunch and
need to be treated gently.

231
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:23,822
I do NOT need any direction on
corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?

232
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:30,689
Okay, little bunnies! I need you
all gather here in the middle.

233
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:34,953
That's right! Let's go, bunnies.
In the center. Hop to it!

234
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,337
Swell. Just swell.

235
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,458
Put 'em up, Winona!

236
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:50,345
Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them!

237
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:53,426
We know what we're doin'.
Get along, little bunnies!

238
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:00,886
Oh no.

239
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,528
STAMPEDE!

240
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:38,761
The horror...! The horror...!

241
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,315
That was awful!

242
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,192
A disaster! A horrible, horrible disaster!

243
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:46,012
I don't get it.

244
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,565
Our gardens! Destroyed!

245
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:50,322
Every last flower devoured.

246
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,131
By... By... THEM!!!

247
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:55,717
Oh my! Oh... Please stop, little bunnies!

248
00:18:56,165 --> 00:19:00,037
No no! Please, let's go home! Oh my goodness!

249
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:03,090
All right. Enough is enough.

250
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,200
Must... keep... buckin'.

251
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:12,600
Just... a few... more...
Must... finish harvestin'.

252
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,340
All right, Applejack. Your applebucking
hasn't just caused you problems.

253
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:19,614
It's over-propelled pegasus, practically
poisoned plenty of ponies...

254
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,937
...and terrorized bushels of
brand new bouncing baby bunnies.

255
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,977
I don't care what you say. You! Need! Help!

256
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:30,923
No, I don't. Look! I did it!

257
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:36,019
I harvested the entire Sweet
Apple Acres without your help.

258
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,705
How d'ya like them apples?

259
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,464
Um... How do *you* like *them* apples?

260
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:55,746
...plejack? Applejack!

261
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:58,499
Oh, good! You're okay.

262
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:02,256
Now, Applejack, I completely
respect the Apple family ways.

263
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,826
You're always there to help anypony in need.

264
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:09,689
So maybe you can put a little of your stubborn
pride aside and allow your friends to help you?

265
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,548
Okay, Twilight.

266
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:14,082
I am not taking "no" for an answer... what?

267
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:19,201
Yes, Twilight. Yes, please!
I could really use your help.

268
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:25,167
"Dear Princess Celestia."

269
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:28,539
"My friend Applejack is the best
friend a pony could ever have."

270
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:30,858
"And she's always there to help anypony."

271
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:34,680
"The only trouble is, when she needs
help, she finds it hard to accept it."

272
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:37,854
"So while friendship is about
giving of ourselves to friends..."

273
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,486
"...it's also about accepting
what our friends have to offer."

274
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,183
"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

275
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:45,053
How about y'all take a little break?

276
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:47,573
I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!

277
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:51,526
Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help.

278
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:54,920
-I was acting... a bit stubborn.
-A bit?

279
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:57,113
Okay. A might stubborn!

280
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,521
And I'm awful sorry.

281
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:03,183
Now, I know the town gave
me the Prized Pony award...

282
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,235
...but the real award is
havin' you five as my friends.

283
00:21:08,752 --> 00:21:12,570
Phew! That applebucking
sure made me hungry!

284
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,574
And I've got the perfect treat!

285
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:18,442
Eeeew... Spike, I threw them all away!
Where'd you get them?

286
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:19,501
From the trash!

287
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:25,380
Just a little nibble? Come on.

288
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:33,346
