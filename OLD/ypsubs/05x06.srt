1
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:11,364
Aren't you glad
y'all came with me

2
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:14,564
to see Applejack compete
in the Appleoosa Rodeo?

3
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:15,625
Totally!

4
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:17,898
This place is a
Cutie Mark gold mine!

5
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:19,372
There's barrel racing...

6
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:23,120
Roping contests...

7
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:25,044
Rodeo clownin'...

8
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:27,288
Steeplechase...

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,492
If we can get into
some of these events,

10
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:33,313
we could all three walk off
the train back in Ponyville

11
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:35,894
with brand spankin'
new Cutie Marks!

12
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:38,307
Wouldn't a barrel
look good here?

13
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:40,016
I want a lasso!

14
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,452
I don't know.

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,115
All these events look a
little, well, dangerous.

16
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:46,905
No risk, no reward.

17
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,532
<i> All right,</i>
<i> everypony listen up!</i>

18
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:52,842
We need a big presence
at this here rodeo,

19
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:54,913
so make yourself plenty seen!

20
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:59,288
I want that low-down varmint
to know we mean business!

21
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:01,410
I hope nothing
bad is going on.

22
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:04,985
A Cutie-Mark-a-palooza
and a low-down varmint?

23
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:08,673
This is shapin' up to be the
most exciting rodeo ever!

24
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,324
Yeah! Come on!

25
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,784
Regular subtitles by YayPonies
We have Muffins!
http://main.yayponies.eu

26
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,960
Woohoo!

27
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,046
Yeehaw!

28
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,233
That's my cousin!

29
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,597
Go Applejack go!

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,987
Phew! It's been a dog's age
since I got to compete.

31
00:02:18,113 --> 00:02:20,080
All the rodeos 'round
Ponyville have closed down

32
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:20,791
for some reason.

33
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:23,861
Well, I guess having injured
kinfolk in Appleoosa

34
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,671
sure paid off then, huh cuz?

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,458
Just doin' my best to fill
your horseshoes, Braeburn.

36
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,086
Keep tossin' like that
and I'll be out of a job!

37
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:32,631
Ow-ow.

38
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,075
Ooh. Sorry.

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,006
Say, where's my sister
and her friends?

40
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,806
Uh-oh, gee I, uh...

41
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,218
I guess I got so caught up
watching you that I--

42
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:44,189
You said you'd keep an
eye on those fillies!

43
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,901
How am I supposed to focus on
practicing if you're not gonna--

44
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:47,869
There they are!

45
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:49,978
Right where I
left 'em.

46
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:53,717
Aw, don't be mad.

47
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,058
Ouch.

48
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:57,562
My foreleg!

49
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,633
Hurts so much.

50
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:04,669
Y'all can't go running
off like that, y'hear?

51
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,498
Backstage at a rodeo
ain't no kinda playground.

52
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,789
Sorry, Applejack. We
won't wander off again.

53
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:14,008
But, uh, speakin' of the rodeo,

54
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,496
what would you say about
me and the Crusaders

55
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,686
maybe competin' in one teensy
weensy little event or three?

56
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:22,071
Look out!

57
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:32,917
What the hay just happened?

58
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:34,829
You fillies all right?

59
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:35,936
Uh-huh.

60
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,966
Sugar and Saltlicks!

61
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,058
Well, I'll be...

62
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:42,134
What is it, Sheriff?

63
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,162
Is it him?

64
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,713
Ain't no doubt.

65
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:52,248
It's Trouble Shoes.

66
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,400
Is it true? 
Is Trouble Shoes here?

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,113
You ain't gonna shut down
the rodeo, are ya?

68
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:16,728
All right now, I called for
a meetin', not a mob scene.

69
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:22,496
Now as many of you know, the
Equestria rodeo circuit

70
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:26,825
has been plagued by the dirty
dealings of a notorious outlaw.

71
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:30,513
He knocked barrels every which
way at the Hoof City Rodeo!

72
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:32,572
Nearly crushed my Aunt Bay Mare!

73
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:33,722
That's nothin'!

74
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:37,427
He sabotaged the steer
pen at Pinto Creek Rodeo,

75
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,688
settin' off such a stampede

76
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:42,008
they cancelled the
whole dadgum thing!

77
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,130
Now, Now.

78
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:46,778
It's true, we had an
incident this mornin'

79
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,993
at our own Appleoosa rodeo.

80
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,096
Hay bale stack came
down pretty near on top

81
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,621
of three little fillies.

82
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:56,981
I examined them
hoofprints myself, and...

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,928
It was Trouble Shoes, all right.

84
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:04,509
I reckon I oughta
cancel this rodeo

85
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:06,357
like all the others done...

86
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,722
But daghoofit, this
has gone far enough!

87
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,717
We'll double the patrols!

88
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:14,425
This rodeo will go on!

89
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:18,000
Appleoosa ain't
gonna be intimidated!

90
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:21,654
Glad that's settled.

91
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:26,762
So, uh, Applejack, about me and
my pals competin' in the rodeo.

92
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,235
Don't send us home! It's not fair!

93
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,353
Now quit your
belly-aching.

94
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:37,915
I can't have y'all around here
with some outlaw on the loose.

95
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:41,995
Aw, maybe I oughta call
it quits and go home too.

96
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:43,646
No, you can't!

97
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,658
This rodeo is important to
Appleoosa and with you in there,

98
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,600
we got a real shot at winnin'.

99
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:52,058
Come on, now, you head
on back to practice

100
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:53,869
and don't worry none
about these three.

101
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:55,717
I won't let 'em
outta my sight.

102
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:00,812
Ya hear?

103
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,578
Y'all ain't leavin' my sight.

104
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:21,637
I thought we weren't
going to wander off again.

105
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:23,633
This ain't wandering.

106
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:26,846
We know exactly where we're
headed: to find Trouble Shoes.

107
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:29,364
But isn't he a
dangerous criminal?

108
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:32,416
We only need to find him; we
don't need to capture him.

109
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,168
The sheriff can handle that.

110
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:37,688
And once he's in jail, we'll
be competing, and then it's...

111
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,229
...Cutie Mark city!

112
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,995
Worst idea ever.

113
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,473
It's another giant hoofprint!

114
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:02,707
Do either of you have
any idea where we are?

115
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:11,242
Uh, maybe we should head
back and try again later.

116
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:13,760
Come on, before
we lose the trail!

117
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,825
Come on, we've
gone far enough!

118
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,240
It's time to
go back!

119
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,850
The rain is only getting
worse, Apple Bloom.

120
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,328
Let's come
back tomorrow.

121
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:37,675
Maybe y'all are right.

122
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,616
So how do we get back?

123
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,648
You mean you
don't know?

124
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:49,903
Good job, y'all.

125
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,589
I know they need lots of
mud for the rodeo tomorrow,

126
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:55,368
but I wish they woulda warned
us about this rainstorm.

127
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,265
Braeburn?

128
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:00,223
Where are the girls?

129
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,589
Heh heh.

130
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:04,463
WHAT?

131
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,488
Fished. My. Wish.

132
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,829
Gol-dang nab it!

133
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,204
Sheriff Silverstar!
You gotta help!

134
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,383
My sister's gone!

135
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:23,612
And her friends, too!

136
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,298
I've searched and searched
but no sign of 'em anywhere.

137
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:28,218
It must've been
Trouble Shoes!

138
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:30,475
Now hold on there.

139
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,600
Trouble Shoes done a lot
of bad things in his day,

140
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,141
but nothin' like that.

141
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,237
You really want to
take that chance?

142
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:40,471
Come on, y'all!

143
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:41,600
Let's ride!

144
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,951
You sure about
this, Scootaloo?

145
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,181
I thought I was,
but now I'm not.

146
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:54,690
So I pretty much got us
completely and totally lost.

147
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:57,313
How could this
get any worse?

148
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,010
We gotta get out
of this rain.

149
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,524
There's no tellin' how
long this storm could last.

150
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:10,816
Look!

151
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,296
It looks abandoned.

152
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,890
Let's go see if we can find
some blankets or somethin'.

153
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:46,665
Ow!

154
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:49,153
Whoa!

155
00:09:58,568 --> 00:09:59,431
Hello?

156
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:01,667
You all right?

157
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,974
Surely.

158
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:05,591
We didn't mean no harm.

159
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,360
We just came in to
get out of the rain.

160
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:10,189
Had some hot cider
cooking in the kitchen.

161
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:11,797
Doubt it survived.

162
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:16,665
I ain't gonna rise
to greet y'all.

163
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,943
Awfully rude I reckon,
but as you can see

164
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:20,555
I'm the fresh casualty of an

165
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:23,195
unusually unfortunate
circumstance.

166
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,515
My lot in life, I s'pose.

167
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:26,597
Are you...

168
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,408
Trouble Shoes?

169
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:29,890
That's me.

170
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:32,277
Wh-what are you doing?

171
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,861
I'm gonna unwrap him.

172
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,301
You can't do that.

173
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,743
That's Trouble Shoes!

174
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,804
Aw, he don't seem so bad.

175
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,046
A'course guests would arrive

176
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:50,269
while I ain't got
no pie to offer.

177
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:54,143
Score s'more misfortune
points for ol' Trouble Shoes.

178
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,837
Whoa!

179
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:06,627
Typical.

180
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,829
Bad luck never rests.

181
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:10,745
You sure that's bad luck?

182
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:14,543
Seems like maybe you're
just a little, um...

183
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,503
klutzy?

184
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:17,435
Tell that to the flank!

185
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:19,208
Upside down horseshoe.

186
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:20,488
Bad luck.

187
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:23,924
Follows me wherever I go
like sour on old milk.

188
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,732
Y'all best vamoose a'fore
my bad luck rubs off

189
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:27,760
and sticks to y'all.

190
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:28,892
Get along.

191
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:30,016
Skedaddle.

192
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:33,044
Amskray!

193
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,473
Um...we don't really know
the way back to Appleoosa.

194
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,701
But a'course I do.

195
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:42,656
Wouldn't ya know
it, my lucky day.

196
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,877
It's actually kinda sweet of
him to help us out like this.

197
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:48,829
I know.

198
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,322
What do we do if he takes
us back to Appleoosa

199
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,901
and the Sheriff arrests him?

200
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,640
If I get a Cutie Mark for that,

201
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,715
I'll feel guilty
every time I see it.

202
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:01,978
Say there, Trouble Shoes, you
might not want to take us

203
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:03,966
all the way back to Appleoosa.

204
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:06,202
The Sheriff sorta has
it in his mind that

205
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:08,875
you're a no good outlaw lookin'
to shut down the rodeo.

206
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,254
My kinda luck he'd think that.

207
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:12,349
But...

208
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:13,507
is it true?

209
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:16,210
Y'all like stories?

210
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:17,208
Mm hm.

211
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,090
Just my luck.

212
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:21,162
I was hopin' you'd say no.

213
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,593
<i> When I was a colt,</i>

214
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:27,776
<i> I wanted to be a rodeo</i>
<i> star somethin' fierce,</i>

215
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:30,467
<i> but I just didn't seem</i>
<i> to have a knack for it.</i>

216
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:33,132
Whoa!

217
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:40,261
Oh!

218
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:43,806
<i>I practiced and practiced and...</i>

219
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:45,397
Whoa!

220
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,218
<i> ...and finally I</i>
<i> wrangled up the guts</i>

221
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:50,408
<i> to audition for</i>
<i> rodeo school.</i>

222
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:52,042
<i>Right in middle of that tryout,</i>

223
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,526
<i> I knew I was doin'</i>
<i> what I was meant to.</i>

224
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,349
<i> And wouldn't ya know it?</i>

225
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,144
<i> In a flash comes</i>
<i> this here Cutie Mark.</i>

226
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,356
<i> I can still remember</i>
<i> them judges laughin'.</i>

227
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,911
<i> I didn't even finish my</i>
<i> routine 'cause right then</i>

228
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:16,400
<i> I knew bad luck was my fate.</i>

229
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:20,720
<i> That fire for rodeo'in</i>
<i> never did leave me, though.</i>

230
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:22,597
<i> I couldn't keep away from 'em.</i>

231
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:27,452
<i> So I'd sneak down and have a</i>
<i> look and wouldn't ya know it,</i>

232
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:32,202
<i> bad luck would strike again.</i>

233
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,282
<i> Just my lot in life, I reckon.</i>

234
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,703
Poor Trouble Shoes.

235
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,576
I can't believe
those mean judges

236
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:42,122
would laugh at
him like that.

237
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:43,292
Don't ya see?

238
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:45,187
They weren't
laughing at him;

239
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,082
they were just
enjoyin' the show!

240
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:48,534
What are you saying?

241
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:49,275
Think about it.

242
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:53,103
If we saw a rodeo clown doin'
what he did back in that shack,

243
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,280
we'd think he was the greatest!

244
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:56,610
You're right!

245
00:13:56,842 --> 00:14:00,168
He could still be in rodeos,
just not the way he thought.

246
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,503
So he's been looking at his
Cutie Mark wrong the whole time!

247
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,313
It's not bad luck, it's--

248
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,126
Gotcha!

249
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,934
Just my luck.

250
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:15,178
Trouble Shoes, you're under
arrest for vandalizin'

251
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:17,128
the property and peace of mind

252
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:20,189
of the good, rodeo-lovin'
ponies of Equestria,

253
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:25,178
not to mention fillynappin'
and generalized mayhem.

254
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:25,949
Wait!

255
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,341
Braeburn, get these
fillies someplace safe.

256
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:29,600
Wait! No!

257
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:30,968
Listen, Applejack!

258
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:32,724
No!

259
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:40,711
<i> But Trouble Shoes isn't the menace</i>

260
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:42,210
everypony thinks!

261
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:44,147
Sakes alive,
what's with you?

262
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,629
Why in tarnation would you want
me to help get him out of jail

263
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:50,088
when he's the one who ran
off with y'all to begin with?

264
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:52,454
Now if y'all excuse me,

265
00:14:52,602 --> 00:14:55,915
I'm off to win the Appleoosa
Rodeo Hay Bale Monster Stack!

266
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:57,633
Um... Applejack?

267
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:07,023
Well, at least
I get me a view

268
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:10,008
of one small corner
of the rodeo.

269
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:13,006
Figures.

270
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:18,467
Aw, come on now, Trouble Shoes,
I'm runnin' out of mattresses!

271
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:36,505
Come on, Sheriff,

272
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,842
you're about to miss the
Hay Bale Monster Stack!

273
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:41,343
Jiminy! That startin' already?

274
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:49,111
Let's go, Trouble Shoes;
this here's a jailbreak!

275
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,711
Ain't no need.

276
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:54,391
Can hear the rodeo just
fine from this vantage.

277
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:56,875
But we've got a plan to
help you live your dream!

278
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:59,705
Listen, y'all, I'm
a known criminal.

279
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:02,370
How you proposin' on
gettin' me into a rodeo?

280
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,206
Woohoo!
You can do it!
Go Applejack!

281
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,637
Well? How do I look?

282
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:27,625
Come on, now,
stack them bales!

283
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,985
Woohoo!

284
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,233
Whoa!

285
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,063
That's my sister!

286
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:58,084
OK now Trouble
Shoes. You're on!

287
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:59,452
Say what?

288
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,671
I may be dressed like one,
but I ain't no rodeo clown.

289
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,061
You got your Cutie Mark
all wrong, Trouble Shoes.

290
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,981
You were born to entertain!

291
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:11,966
You got a gift for makin'
folks laugh, don't you?

292
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,741
But my Cutie Mark's an
upside down horseshoe.

293
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,724
And that means bad luck!

294
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:18,854
That all depends on
how you look at it.

295
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:21,600
You always wanted to be a
part of the rodeo, right?

296
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:24,164
Well, now's your chance.

297
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,431
Go on!

298
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:38,677
Whoa!

299
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:39,301
Oof!

300
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,585
There y'all are.

301
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:50,568
How 'bout your
big sis, huh?

302
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:54,206
Yeah, way to go.

303
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:59,524
Since when are y'all
so into rodeo clowns?

304
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,997
Just leave me be, Cutie Mark.

305
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:26,315
I aim to clear that there hoop.

306
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,035
Come on now!

307
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:58,454
That's the best rodeo
clown I ever seen!

308
00:18:58,585 --> 00:18:59,338
Ha ha ha!

309
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,244
Trouble Shoes!

310
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,524
What the hay?

311
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:21,410
He escaped from
jail!

312
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:23,924
Ruinin' another
rodeo!

313
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,254
Let's get 'im!

314
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:28,618
Wait, y'all!

315
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,374
He ain't what you think he is!

316
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,151
Stand aside, young 'uns.

317
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:34,635
This one's goin'
back to jail.

318
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,595
But he never wanted
to ruin any rodeos!

319
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,326
Those were just bad accidents.

320
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:41,515
Sweetie Belle, what're
you talkin' about?

321
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:44,315
Trouble Shoes has a gift
for making ponies laugh.

322
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:47,254
He's maybe the best
rodeo clown I ever seen.

323
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,328
That's true, he
is awful funny.

324
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,218
He thought his Cutie
Mark was tellin' him

325
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:53,869
to keep away from rodeos,

326
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:57,023
but deep inside he knew that's
where he was meant to be.

327
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:58,867
He just didn't
know how to do it.

328
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,134
What she says is true.

329
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:07,507
This here, entertainin'
y'all with my klutzin',

330
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:09,949
that's what I'm
s'posed to be doin'.

331
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,553
I know it now.

332
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,442
I didn't mean no harm, honest!

333
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:17,747
I just ain't never loved nothin'
like I love the rodeo.

334
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:22,901
So I kept on sneakin' back and
makin' a big ol' mess a' things.

335
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:27,018
Turns out I was just lookin'
at my Cutie Mark all wrong.

336
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:32,160
That may be so, Trouble Shoes,
but you still gotta face charges

337
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:33,966
for the problems you caused.

338
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:38,067
If I done wrong, I'll see to
it that I take my medicine

339
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,667
and square my accounts.

340
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,381
Truth be told, we could
understand all the trouble

341
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:44,720
with the rodeos.

342
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:48,126
But why'd ya have to run off
with these here littl'uns

343
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:49,094
last night?

344
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,865
Uh... yeah, about that...

345
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,905
You really want us to clean
up all this mess

346
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:02,277
Trouble Shoes made?

347
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:04,421
Maybe it'll teach you
not to go wanderin' off

348
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:05,844
after I say not to.

349
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:09,633
Ain't it bad enough that you
get to go back to Ponyville

350
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:12,341
with a shiny trophy and
all we're bringin' back

351
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:14,614
is these same old
blank flanks?

352
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,722
Y'all helped Trouble Shoes

353
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,581
really means.

354
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:21,764
Ain't that a nice feeling
you can take back with ya?

355
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,564
I guess we did make
things a little better.

356
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:26,640
Does feel kinda nice.

357
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:28,787
So, we can stop now?

358
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:30,345
Nope.
