was extinct.

I make it relatable.

00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:56,060
Because I know you.

Well, maybe you don't know
me as well as you think.

323
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:03,648
And I suppose it's just a
coincidence that Trenderhoof

324
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,841
seems so interested
in country life too?

325
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,384
I don't know what
you're gettin' at.

326
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,770
Well, then I guess I'll
just have to show you.

327
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,183
Be my guest.

328
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:15,920
Now, if y'all will excuse
me, I have a hootenanny

Now, to be a model in the
Simple Ways fashion show,

333
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:32,269
you might think simple
means less is more.

Well, that just ain't so.

335

If you want to be real
simple, more is more.

Now y'all go off and make
yourselves look just like that.

337
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:59,160
Who's our next model

Why, Rarity, what ever would
make you think I was joking?

Because you would never
wear an ensemble like that!

345
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,434
You like plowing fields
and hauling apples...

00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:41,211
And I can like
fashion just as much.

Well, maybe you do not know

Fine.

350
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:50,335
But I got a whole
Festival to plan,

351
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:53,892
so if you're gonna start
modelin', just get on with it.

352
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:59,781
Life is a festival, and you
should celebrate it

353
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:04,624
by looking just like me, because
I'm a trend-setting Fashionista!

You're a trend-setting
Fashionista?

355
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:12,798
Why that's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever--

356
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:16,099
I mean, good for you.

Not me.

362
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:35,793
My mane needs to be perfectly
coiffed at all times.

363
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:41,102
Well, my mane is full
of dust and split ends.

364
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,948
My hooves are so polished you
can see your reflection in them.

365
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:49,830
My hooves are cracked and dry
from working in the fields!

I said all those things.

I don't know what I was thinking
wearing this ridiculous outfit.

I kinda know how you feel.

382

But you were just trying to help
me see how silly I was being.

Oh. It's uh... one of yours.

391
00:19:56,616 --> 00:19:59,077
I'll need 3 gallons of boiling
water and one ounce of detergent

00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,633
Being the most interesting Pony
in Equestria is exhausting.

396
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:12,593

Well, that's real nice, but I
sure hope you weren't thinking

Look, you're a fine
pony, but uh, well, I'm...

403
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,729
I think what Applejack
is trying to say,

404
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:33,211
is that there's something
unappealing about a pony

405
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:36,259
who'd change themselves so much
just to impress somepony else.

406
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,915
If somepony doesn't like you for
who you are, it's their loss.

00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:44,191
Well, this is awkward.
