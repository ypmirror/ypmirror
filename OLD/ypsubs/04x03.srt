1
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:12,154
What's wrong, Twilight?

2
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:15,079
I've gone through every
book in Ponyville, Spike,

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,637
and there isn't a single mention
of the mysterious chest

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,176
that came from the
Tree of Harmony.

5
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:21,592
Nor anything about
keys to unlock it.

6
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:24,934
But something tells me that
opening it is pretty important.

7
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:28,070
I hope Princess
Celestia has some ideas.

8
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,394
If the Library in Canterlot
doesn't have anything,

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,859
I don't know where
else to look.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:32,704
Ahhhh!

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,365
My dearest Twilight, while it
would be perfectly lovely

12
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,084
to have you in
Canterlot once more,

13
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:42,803
I have another
option in mind

14
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,593
much closer to Ponyville...

15
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:47,071
<i>As you know,</i>
<i>the ancient Castle</i>

16
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:49,043
<i>that I once shared</i>
<i>with Princess Luna</i>

17
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:52,868
<i>lies mostly in ruins deep</i>
<i>in the Everfree Forest.</i>

18
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,851
<i>But if you look carefully,</i>
<i>you may find a book</i>

19
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,953
<i>that could prove helpful</i>
<i>to your research</i>

20
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:01,278
<i>hidden somewhere in what's</i>
<i>left of the Castle library.</i>

21
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:09,217
Wow! Look at all
these ancient books.

22
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:11,947
It's a veritable gold
mine of information.

23
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:14,825
I can't believe
it! Woo-hoo!

24
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,288
Whoa!

25
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:19,621
Gah!

26
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:25,069
Heh, heh. So, Twilight.
Uh, ready to head home?

27
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:26,679
Are you kidding?

28
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,702
This place is PERFECT!

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,150

30
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:20,204
I'm not gonna move.
You move.

31
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:24,249
Uh-uh. There's no way
I'm moving.

32
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:27,116
This is the most daring
dare any pony ever dared

33
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,671
dare another pony to dare.

34
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:29,633
Huh?

35
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:31,129
It's exciting!

36
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,400
What y'all doing?

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,176
Rainbow Dash and Applejack are
competing for the title

38
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:40,640
of Most Daring Pony.

39
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:42,513
This is the final test.

40
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,042
The Bee Stare.

41
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:46,033
Last pony to blink wins.

42
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,051
I'm gonna need my bees back.

43
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:54,060
But then we'll never find out
who the Most Daring Pony is.

44
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:55,748
Sorry about that.

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,903
Well, what do we do now?

46
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:05,270
Don't worry ladies, I've been
keeping excellent score all day.

47
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:08,995
Hmm. move the decimal,
carry the two, and ...

48
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:10,130
Congratulations!

49
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:11,367
You're tied!

50
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:12,271
Tied?

51
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:16,378
You can't be tied for
the Most Daring Pony.

52
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:17,246
I don't know.

53
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,866
Numbers don't lie.

54
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:24,536
I'd love to stay and
keep keeping score,

55
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:26,511
but I promised to help
test the new school bell.

56
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:29,356
I get to ring it
all week non-stop.

57
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:30,638
And I don't even
have to take turns

58
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,600
because no one
else volunteered!

59
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,806
OK. No problem.

60
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,476
We just have to come up
with another daring dare.

61
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:39,114
Right.

62
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:47,297
I think I might have an
idea of what we can do.

63
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:54,446
Um... Rarity, don't you think
it's a little late in the day

64
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,955
to be walking through
the forest?

65
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:58,920
It is Star Spider
season, after all.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,197
Though I'm sure you have
a very good reason...

67
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:05,845
Simply the most important reason
I've ever had in my entire life.

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,015
Oh. Well, then I'm
happy to help.

69
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:09,082
What is it?

70
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:12,398
I've heard rumors that the
Castle of the Two Sisters

71
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,520
is filled with the most gorgeous
of ancient tapestries

72
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,469
in all of Pony History.

73
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:20,400
It pains me to think of those
magnificent creations

74
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:24,370
rotting away in those old
ruins, totally unappreciated.

75
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,302
I see.

76
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:29,631
I require your help in
borrowing one or two

77
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:31,861
to bring back to the boutique
where I can restore them.

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,776
Maybe I'll even use the
patterns as the inspiration

79
00:04:34,794 --> 00:04:35,884
for a new line.

80
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,779
That does sound...

81
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:39,941
very important.

82
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:43,646
Yes, well, maybe not the
most important thing

83
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,082
in my entire life,

84
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:47,972
but retro-ancient
classical will be all the rage

85
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:50,142
next season, so it's
nothing to sneeze at.

86
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,611
Um, are you sure you
need those tapestries?

87
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:02,839
But, of course.

88
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:06,749
Although, I must admit,
these ruins are a fright.

89
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:09,650
Look at all the
dirt everywhere.

90
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,439
Ew.

91
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:13,639
Angel!

92
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,909
It's practically an
artistic treasure trove

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,600
of ancient good taste.

94
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:31,557
Angel, you really shouldn't
have run off like that.

95
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,949
Ancient ruins are filled with
all sorts of things

96
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,969
that can hurt you.

97
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:37,906
You could stub your toe
or trip on a loose stone.

98
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:39,722
You have to be careful.

99
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,135
I don't think I'll need
all these candles, Twilight.

100
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,878
I was really only
scared for a second.

101
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:50,470
Oh, these aren't
for you, Spike.

102
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,632
We're going to be studying
late into the night

103
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,548
and we're going to need
all the light we can get.

104
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,822
Oh. Great.

105
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:00,534
Well? Here we are!

106
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:03,317
Eh ? What's so daring
about this place?

107
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,562
This is where we got the
Elements of Harmony.

108
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:08,880
When I was just a filly,
Grannie Smith told me

109
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,261
of an ancient legend...

110
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:12,296
When Nightmare
Moon was banished,

111
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,007
not every last bit of her
dark magic went with her.

112
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,230
<i>Grannie used to say when</i>
<i>night falls on the Castle,</i>

113
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:23,434
that magic takes the form of...

114
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:26,737
THE PONY OF SHADOWS.

115
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,597
You mean like a ghost?

116
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,464
No pony knows.

117
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:33,391
Ugh!

118
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:37,424
This one is perfect!

119
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,502
Well, it certainly could
use some restoration.

120
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:42,665
Be a dear.

121
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,657
Fly up there and lift
it off that hook.

122
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,392
Maybe from below?

123
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,586
I don't see what's so
daring about an old legend.

124
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,149
Plus, I don't
believe in ghosts.

125
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:10,156
You might wanna re-think
your position on that.

126
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:23,545
You saw that, right?

127
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:24,881
RUN!

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,929
Ow, I think I hurt my wing.

129
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:34,437
Oh, my dear, I
am so sorry.

130
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:36,035
That tapestry is
far too heavy.

131
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,678
We'll just have to
find a smaller one.

132
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,052
Oh. Of course.

133
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:42,296
Where, pray tell, did
you disappear to?

134
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:43,775
What do you mean?

135
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:45,761
While you were struggling
under that fabric,

136
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,404
the entire wall
spun around.

137
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:49,715
You must have activated
a secret door.

138
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:51,447
Oh, I'm sorry.

139
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:55,032
I suppose these ruins
are chock-full of them.

140
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,996
Really?

141
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:56,874
Absolutely.

142
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,231
We must use the
utmost care as we...

143
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:08,343
OK. So maybe the
legend is true.

144
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,253
Well, that's why I
brought you here.

145
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,874
I guess only the most
daring pony of all

146
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,146
could stay in this
castle all night

147
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:15,434
without
being scared off.

148
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:18,735
Scared?

149
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:20,329
I'm not scared.

150
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,360
Well, me neither!

151
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,654
Then it's settled.

152
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:28,569
Whoever stays in the Castle the
longest is the Most Daring Pony.

153
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:30,573
Deal!

154
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:35,373
But it's gonna take a lot more
than some shadowy ghost pony

155
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,940
to get me to leave.

156
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,733
Me, too.

157
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:47,904
Find anything, Spike?

158
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,300
Uh... Nope.

159
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:51,287
Nothing yet.

160
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:53,541
Aaaaaah!

161
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:55,125
Angel?

162
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,852
What are you doing here?

163
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,971
The Journal of the
Two Sisters.

164
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:15,040
Maybe this is the book Princess
Celestia was talking about!

165
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,771
I sure hope you're not afraid
of the dark, Applejack.

166
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,837
I can't say that I am,
but even if I was,

167
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,254
I'd be at least fifty percent
less scared of it

168
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,090
than you, Rainbow Dash.

169
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:30,199
I don't know how all
that math works because

170
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,701
I'm not scared at all.

171
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,936
Me neither.

172
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:34,977
Huh?

173
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,610
What's the matter?

174
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:43,869
It's just a dark hallway full
of disembodied pony legs.

175
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,210
Yeah. Nothing
creepy about that.

176
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:54,046
<i>I'm starting to wonder</i>
<i>if maybe this castle</i>

177
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,740
<i>doesn't want my expertise.</i>

178
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:57,861
Oh, dear.

179
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,901
Angel?

180
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:00,620
Rarity, have you seen him?

181
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:03,787
I'm not sure he made the
trip down with us, dear.

182
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:04,969
Oh, goodness.

183
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,132
We have to find him.

184
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:08,437
An ancient castle is
no place for a bunny.

185
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:10,220
He could get hit
by falling debris

186
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:12,126
or the floor could
give out under him.

187
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:16,191
Oh! He could be trapped in a
dark place with no way out.

188
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:18,901
I can only imagine
how that might feel.

189
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:21,268
Hmmm.

190
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:29,322
Applejack, if you're scared,
you can just admit it.

191
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:31,480
You don't need to put
your hoof around me.

192
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:34,448
Uh... I'm over here.

193
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:46,031
Rarity, what is it?

194
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,426
I felt something.

195
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:49,319
ALIVE!

196
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,108
Angel!

197
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:01,404
Well, tapestries or no, I have
had just about enough

198
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,253
of secret passages,
mysterious presences

199
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,103
and unappreciative castles.

200
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:09,030
But we can't leave now.

201
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:12,173
Not with Angel lost somewhere
in this dangerous old Castle.

202
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:14,819
He could be trapped
under a crumbling statue

203
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,474
or stuck high in a tower
without food or water

204
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,872
or any friends at all!

205
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:25,410
Spike, you've got to hear this.

206
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,625
I love to duck behind
the paintings

207
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,055
and though the Hall of Hooves

208
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,774
still gives her a
bit of a fright,

209
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:33,600
the trap door slide
is Luna's favorite.

210
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:35,510
Hall of Hooves?

211
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:39,123
Soon the Organ to the
Outside will be finished.

212
00:11:39,153 --> 00:11:40,692
I can hardly wait.

213
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,754
What's the Organ
to the Outside?

214
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,810
I have no idea.

215
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:58,396
You hear that?

216
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:03,221
You mean the creepy sound
of a haunted pipe organ?

217
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:05,350
Uh... Maybe.

218
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,859
I don't know what
you're talking about.

219
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,216
Uh, Twilight?

220
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:15,836
Did you hear something?

221
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:16,901
Oh, Spike.

222
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:18,801
Quit being such
a scaredy dragon.

223
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:20,936
This castle is
thousands of years old

224
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,274
and half of it was destroyed
by Nightmare Moon.

225
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,192
Of course it makes
strange sounds;

226
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:27,080
it's practically
falling apart.

227
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:31,867
OK.

228
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:37,360
Angel? Angel?

229
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,094
I'm sure we'll find him.

230
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:41,350
Angel?

231
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,791
Did you find Angel?

232
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,031
Is he OK?

233
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:50,202
They are perfect!

234
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,385
No castle in its right mind
could possibly object

235
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,754
to my restoring such
exquisite works of art.

236
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:58,054
Oh, they're lovely, Rarity,

237
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,622
but I have to keep
looking for Angel.

238
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:03,687
I hope he doesn't think
I've given up on him.

239
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,746
I'm right behind you.

240
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,665
Won't be a moment...

241
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,365
Do you think there's a
single room in this Castle

242
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,849
that isn't filled with
terrifying things?

243
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:21,155
Whoa!

244
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,530
Heh heh.

245
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,038
It's just old pony armor.

246
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:25,964
What's the big deal?

247
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:27,002
Yeah.

248
00:13:27,342 --> 00:13:29,871
It's not like it's going
to come to life or anything.

249
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:30,868
Right?

250
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:37,998
Huh?

251
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,144
Whoa!

252
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,189
Now, you look here, Castle.

253
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,992
You are very old and
very scary,

254
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,756
but your wall art is
in an atrocious state

255
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,537
and there is nothing you
can do to keep me

256
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,559
from my sacred task
of restoration.

257
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,127
Uh, Applejack?

258
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:36,950
If you went back to
Ponyville, that means I win.

259
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:37,697
Right?

260
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:46,337
Rarity?

261
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:50,696
I know hiding isn't really
your sense of humor,

262
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,806
but please let this be a joke.

263
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,040
Rainbow?

264
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,640
Hello?

265
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:17,680
I guess if I don't find you,
I win by default. Right?

266
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:25,886
Oof!

267
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:31,566
Of all the castles
in Equestria,

268
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:34,050
this is by far the
most ungrateful.

269
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,213
Oof!

270
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,242
Angel!

271
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,277
Rarity?

272
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,213
Oh, I hope you two
are together.

273
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,139
Haunted statues, creepy armor...

274
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,210
Come on, Castle, is
that all you got?

275
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:23,959
I was only trying to restore
ancient art!

276
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:30,519
Angel?

277
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,373
ANGEL!

278
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:39,178
What it the world is that?

279
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,858
Oh, you know.

280
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:44,380
Probably just more strange
sounds of this old castle

281
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:45,240
falling apart.

282
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:48,113
No one likes sarcasm, Spike.

283
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,083
What got into them?

284
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:00,491
It's OK, Angel.

285
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,366
You're OK. YOU'RE OK!

286
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,043
Shadows everywhere!

287
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,191
Angel!

288
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,491
All right. Everypony STOP!

289
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:17,533
Twilight?

290
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:18,388
Must.

291
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:19,402
Save.

292
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:20,561
Angel.

293
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:22,620
Oh.

294
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,638
Fluttershy?

295
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,048
What are you doing here?

296
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:27,381
She's with me.

297
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:34,766
Thank you!

298
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:36,464
Have you all spent
the whole night

299
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:38,316
running around
scaring each other?

300
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:40,440
Well, that depends.

301
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,062
On what?

302
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,908
On whether or not you're
the Pony of Shadows?

303
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,388
What's the Pony of Shadows?

304
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,747
Oh, that's just an
old pony's tale.

305
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:55,578
Then who's playing that?

306
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,937
We're going to find out.

307
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,560
THE PONY OF SHADOWS!

308
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:45,707
Hey, you guys.

309
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:47,512
Did you know I can
totally play the organ?

310
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,034
Because I didn't.

311
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,694
PINKIE!

312
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:51,703
Check it out.

313
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,234
You're the Pony
of Shadows?

314
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,758
The Pony of what?

315
00:18:58,226 --> 00:18:59,900
See? What did I tell you?

316
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:02,517
I thought you had to ring
the school bell all week.

317
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:03,307
Oh, yeah.

318
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,287
I only had to ring
it for like, five minutes.

319
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:06,487
They said that was good enough.

320
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,212
I can't imagine why.

321
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,028
So, then I decided to throw a

322
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:14,796
Finished Ringing The
School Bell party,

323
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,076
but I didn't have
any bluebells

324
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,495
and you can't throw a Finished
Ringing The School Bell party

325
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:21,172
without bluebells so I went to
Everfree forest to pick some,

326
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,680
but it started to
get so chilly

327
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,452
I had to wrap myself up in
the tarp I was gonna use

328
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,239
to gather flowers

329
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:26,735
And then I saw
Fluttershy and Rarity,

330
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:27,953
but they went into the Castle

331
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,564
before I could invite
them to my party.

332
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:31,283
Luckily, I followed
them inside

333
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,946
so I could help you all
with your party.

334
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:34,985
What party is that?

335
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,467
Uh, The Everypony Come To
The Scary Old Castle

336
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,892
And Hide From Each Other While
I Play The Organ Party.

337
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:43,951
Duh!

338
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:54,089
I swear this is going right
back where I found it

339
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,881
just as soon as I've returned
it to its former glory.

340
00:19:57,838 --> 00:19:59,943
Now don't go running off again.

341
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,694
Ooh. I can't believe I
was so frightened.

342
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:05,410
I guess I let my imagination
get the best of me.

343
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:07,319
I think we all did.

344
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,808
I always let my imagination
run away from me.

345
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:12,347
Then it comes back with cake.

346
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:16,366
Well, it's good to know that
whenever your imagination

347
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:19,693
is getting away from you, a good
friend can help you rein it in.

348
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,707
And even though I didn't
find anything out

349
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:23,295
about the mysterious chest,

350
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,670
I'm glad I was here to
help all of you.

351
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:27,982
You certainly did
that, Twilight.

352
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:31,028
Yeah, why weren't you scared?

353
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,011
Reading Celestia's diary
made it hard to be afraid

354
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:36,862
because I knew what it was like
when she and Luna lived here.

355
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:38,405
Knowing something
about the past

356
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:40,999
made it easier to deal with my
problems in the present,

357
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:42,932
even the scary ones.

358
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:49,049
I just thought of a great idea!

359
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,741
Why don't we keep a journal?

360
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:52,885
Just like the Royal
Pony Sisters?

361
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:54,152
All of us?

362
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,336
Sure! That way we can
learn from each other.

363
00:20:57,615 --> 00:21:00,027
And maybe someday other
ponies will read it

364
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,346
and learn something too.

365
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:03,670
What a splendid idea!

366
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:06,035
I know what my
first entry will be.

367
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:10,759
Dear Diary, I'm glad Grannie
Smith's legend wasn't true.

368
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:12,288
Me too.

369
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,240
Me three, because
that means you two

370
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:18,653
are still tied for
Most Daring Pony!

371
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,229
Ha! Shadow ponies.

372
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:25,055
How ridiculous is that?
