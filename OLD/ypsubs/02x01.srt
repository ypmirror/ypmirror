1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,280
I want to start our field trip here,
in the world famous Canterlot Sculpture Garden.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,260
That one over there
represents friendship.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,320
All right, my little ponies!

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,440
This one represents victory.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,110
How cool would it be to have
*that* for a cutie mark!

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,660
Cool!

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,120
If you were actually
victoryful at somethin'.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,850
That's not a word!

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,900
What are you? A dictionary?

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,980
Girls!

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,620
Now this is a really interesting statue.

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,940
What do you notice about it?

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,720
It's got an eagle claw!

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,410
-And a lion paw!
-And a snake tail!

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,190
This creature is called a draconequus.

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,930
He is the head of a pony and a body
made up of all sorts of things.

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,030
What do you suppose that represents?

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,200
-Confusion!
-Evil!
-Chaos!

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,380
It's not chaos, you dodo!

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,890
Don't call me things
I don't know the meaning of!

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,780
And it is too chaos!

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,640
Is not!

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,230
You're both wrong!

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,440
Actually, in a way you're all right.

25
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,490
This statue represents discord...

26
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,410
...which means a lack of
harmony between ponies.

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,890
In fact, you three have
demonstrated discord so well...

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,350
...that you're each going to
write me an essay explaining it.

29
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,130
Now let's go. And I don't
want any more fighting.

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,490
-It's confusion!
-Evil!
-Chaos!

31
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,990
Come back here, you!

32
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,240
Gotcha!

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,710
Eeew! What is this?

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,430
Cotton candy?

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,040
Wait a second! It's not supposed
to rain until tomorrow!

36
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,570
You can't just...!

37
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,190
You did.

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,950
Hey! I didn't tell you to go anywhere!

39
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,090
Rainbow Dash! What's
going on with that rain?

40
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,330
I mean... chocolate milk?

41
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,290
I mean... chocolate milk rain?!

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,900
There's crazy weather
all over Equestria!

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,690
Cloudsdale's getting soaked
by a major cola storm right now.

44
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,420
But don't worry. I'm not leaving you,
till I get control of Ponyville.

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,590
Why would you wanna stop *this*?

46
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,300
I heard about your troubles, Applejack,
and I came to see if there's anything I could do.

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,330
Without getting wet. Or dirty.

48
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,210
Or out from under my umbrella.

49
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,180
Fluttershy! Do somethin'!

50
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,540
Now Angel, you really shouldn't...

51
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,900
No! It's not possible!

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,130
I must be seeing things!

53
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,970
Don't worry, everyone! I've learned
a new spell that'll fix everything.

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,440
My fail-safe spell...

55
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,950
...failed! What do we do?

56
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,160
Uh... Give up?

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,320
Spike. Twilight will come up with something.

58
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,420
Time for Plan B.

59
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,910
Rainbow! Can you corral all those
clouds in one corner of the sky?

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,750
Applejack! I need you to bring those
high strong storm clouds down to earth.

61
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,840
Hey! What happened?

62
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,100
Oh dear! I hope that none
of the animals see these...

63
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,020
...delicious chocolate-filled
cotton candy clouds.

64
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,280
I'd hate to have to share them.

65
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,360
You and me both, sister!

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,570
Hey!

67
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,120
And when y'all are done that, feel free
to have some popcorn for dessert.

68
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,810
You see, Spike? You
should never give up.

69
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,360
There's nothing we can't
overcome if we all work together.

70
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,990
Come on, girls! Princess Celestia wants
to see us all in Canterlot immediately!

71
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,690
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

72
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,130
Thank you, Twilight. Thank you all.

73
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,370
Is this about the weather?
And the animals' weird behavior?

74
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,510
What's happening out there? Why
isn't my magic working? Is there...?

75
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,320
Follow me.

76
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,370
I've called you here
for a matter of great importance.

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,630
It seems an old foe of mine...

78
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,910
...someone I thought I had
defeated long ago, has returned.

79
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,100
His name is Discord.

80
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,310
Discord is the mischievous
spirit of disharmony.

81
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,490
Before my sister and I
stood up to him...

82
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,650
...he ruled Equestria in an eternal state
of unrest and unhappiness.

83
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,960
Luna and I saw how miserable
life was for earth ponies...

84
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,020
...pegasi and unicorns alike.

85
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,490
So after discovering
the Elements of Harmony...

86
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,780
...we combined our powers
and rose up against him...

87
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,470
...turning him to stone.

88
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,300
Alright, Princess!

89
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,140
I thought the spell we cast would
keep him contained forever...

90
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,020
...but since Luna and I are
no longer connected to the Elements...

91
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,080
...the spell has been broken.

92
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,770
No longer connected?

93
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,750
This is Canterlot tower, where
the Elements are kept inside...

94
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,120
...since all of you recovered them.

95
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,660
I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony
once again and stop Discord...

96
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,220
...before he thrusts
all of Equestria into eternal chaos.

97
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,170
But why us? Why don't you...?

98
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,130
Hey, look! We're famous!

99
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,820
You six showed the full
potential of the Elements...

100
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,740
...by harnessing the magic of your
friendship to beat a mighty foe.

101
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,380
Although Luna and I
once wielded the Elements...

102
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,780
...it is you, who now control their power.

103
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,560
And it is you, who must defeat Discord!

104
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,590
Princess Celestia, you can count on...

105
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,810
Hold on a second!

106
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,460
Eternal chaos comes with
chocolate rain, you guys!

107
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,310
CHOCOLATE RAIN!

108
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,330
Don't listen to her, Princess.

109
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,090
We'd be honored to use
the Elements of Harmony again.

110
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,660
You can keep the Elements.
I'll take that case.

111
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,430
Have no fear, ponies.

112
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,960
I have total confidence that you
will be able to defeat Discord...

113
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,290
...with these.

114
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,730
Oh well. If anyone needs me...

115
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,920
...I'll be outside in the chocolate
puddles with a giant swizzle straw.

116
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,890
The Elements! They're gone!

117
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,150
That chamber is protected by
a powerful spell that only I can break.

118
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,160
This doesn't make sense...

119
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,610
"Make sense"? Oh, what fun
is there in making sense?

120
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,910
Discord! Show yourself!

121
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,930
Did you miss me, Celestia?

122
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,810
I've missed you.

123
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,370
It's quite lonely being encased in stone.
But you wouldn't know that, would you?

124
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,110
Because I don't turn ponies into stone!

125
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,720
Enough! What have you done
with the Elements of Harmony?

126
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,070
Well, I just borrowed them
for a teensy little while.

127
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,960
You'll never get away
with this, Discord!

128
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,040
Oh, I'd forgotten how grim
you can be, Celestia.

129
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,530
It's really quite boring.

130
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,900
Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,660
Oh! You must be Rainbow Dash...

132
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,150
...famed for her loyalty ‒ the Element
of Harmony you represent.

133
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,270
That's right! I'll always
be loyal to the Princess!

134
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,220
We'll see about that.

135
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,640
I can't believe we're wasting our time
talking to a tacky window.

136
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,470
The beautiful Rarity, representing
the Element of Generosity...

137
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,320
...if I'm not mistaken.

138
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,780
So you know who we are. Big deal.

139
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,810
Oh, I know much more than
that, honest Applejack.

140
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,040
You seem to know our strengths too.

141
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,110
Yes, Twilight Sparkle.

142
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,140
And yours is the most powerful
and elusive element ‒ magic.

143
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,540
Fluttershy's is kindness and Pinkie Pie's
is the personal favorite of mine...

144
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,030
...laughter!

145
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,520
Pinkie!

146
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,670
He's standing on your head!

147
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,390
Stop stalling, Discord!

148
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,670
What have you done with
the Elements of Harmony?

149
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,010
Oh! So boring, Celestia. Really.

150
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,820
Fine. I'll tell you, but
I'll only tell you my way.

151
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,170
To retrieve your missing elements,
just make sense of this change of events.

152
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,220
Twists and turns are my master plan...

153
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,780
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

154
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,310
Can we go home now?

155
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,980
What do you reckon he meant?

156
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,450
"Twists and turns" and then
the "back where we started".

157
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,880
Twists and turns...

158
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,840
Twists and turns...

159
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,750
Twists and turns! That's it!

160
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,820
I bet Discord hid the Elements
in the palace labyrinth!

161
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,010
Good luck, my little ponies.

162
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,820
The fate of Equestria is in your hooves.

163
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,160
Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down.

164
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,930
We... We have to go in there?

165
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,770
Nope! Dopey Discord
forgot about these babies!

166
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,190
I'll just do a quick flyover and
we'll have the Elements in no time.

167
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,610
My wings!

168
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,130
Your horn!

169
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,280
My horn!

170
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,090
You... You should see the looks
on your faces. Priceless!

171
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,970
Give us our wings and horns back!

172
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,670
You'll get them back in good time.

173
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,100
I simply took them to ensure
there's no cheating.

174
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,790
You see, this is the first
rule of our game:

175
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,280
No flying and no magic.

176
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
The first rule?

177
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,820
The second rule is: everypony has to play
or the game is over.

178
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,980
And I win.

179
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,910
Good luck, everypony!

180
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,190
Never fear, girls. We have each other.

181
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,500
Yeah! Like Twilight said.

182
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,140
There's nothing we can't overcome
if we all stick together.

183
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,990
All right, girls! Let's do this.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,260
Together!

185
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,920
Stay calm, girls!

186
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,330
Everypony head to the middle as fast as
you can and we'll regroup there.

187
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,760
-Moving out!
-See you in the center.

188
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,010
-Yeehaw!
-See you guys there!

189
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,090
What's that?! Who's there?! GIIIRLS!

190
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,980
What in tarnation?

191
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,870
Where am I?

192
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,050
Who are y'all?

193
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,040
The keepers of the grove of truth.

194
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,660
You may ask us...

195
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,890
...a one question:

196
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,320
Past, future or present.

197
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,860
But be warned...

198
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,420
...that the truth...

199
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,800
...may not always be pleasant.

200
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,300
Alright then. I don't trust
this place for the hill a' beans...

201
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,370
...but I got a real bad feelin'
about this feller Discord.

202
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,690
What's gonna come of this
here mission we're on?

203
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,460
For the answer you seek...

204
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,630
...go ahead! Take a peek.

205
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,440
I hope I'll never see you again!

206
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
Me too!

207
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,430
-Fine!
-Fine!

208
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,120
It's settled then.

209
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,880
No!

210
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,120
Our friendship... over?

211
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,190
It can't be true. It just can't!

212
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,270
That just can't be the truth.

213
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,460
When all the truth does...

214
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,740
...is make your heart ache...

215
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,930
...sometimes a lie is easier to take.

216
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,900
Applejack! Thank goodness.
I thought I heard voices over here.

217
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,560
Who were you talking to?

218
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,870
I was talkin' to, uh...

219
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,600
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

220
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,380
What?

221
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,520
Nothin'.

222
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,890
Come on. Uh, we best be goin'.

223
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,530
Did Applejack just...

224
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,190
Come on, Twilight.
Applejack wouldn't lie.

225
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,180
This is the greatest
balloon garden I've ever seen!

226
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,240
It's the first balloon garden
I've ever seen, but still...

227
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,790
Hey! What gives?

228
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,870
What's the matter, Pinkie Pie?
I thought you appreciated a good laugh.

229
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,820
It's different. They're
laughing *at* me.

230
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,010
It's hardly different.

231
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,570
Your friends laugh at you all the time.

232
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,160
My friends laugh *with* me, not at me.

233
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,930
Oh, really?

234
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,000
No! Stop it!

235
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,910
Stop laughing at me!

236
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,440
Oh, poor Pinkie Pie.

237
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,950
And here I thought
laughter made you happy.

238
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,140
Happy?

239
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,070
I don't think so.

240
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,180
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

241
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,780
You are, huh? WHY? Need a good laugh?

242
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,880
Pinkie?

243
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,480
What do you suppose has her
so upset? It's not like her.

244
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,980
I didn't notice anythin'
strange about Pinkie.

245
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,210
Weird. Better pick up the pace before
the stress of this gets the better of all of us.

246
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,020
I was expecting an audience with
the Princess, not outdoor sports.

247
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,380
Oh my.

248
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,850
Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity.

249
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,030
You've found the one thing in Equestria
that could rival my face for sheer beauty.

250
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,360
What do you think? You like?

251
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,020
Yes... I like very much.

252
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,570
NO! No. I shan't succumb
to such fabulousness.

253
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,520
Must... get to the center...
to meet... the others...

254
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,990
MINE!!!

255
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,560
Well, Rarity...

256
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,950
It took forever, but it was worth it.

257
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,320
Who knew three little gemstones would turn out
to be this handsome HUNK of a diamond?

258
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,480
Now to get you home.

259
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,710
Rarity! Are we glad to see...

260
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,250
Why are you carrying
a humongous boulder?

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,830
What do you mean "boulder"?

262
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:27,080
This big, beautiful, bedazzling
rock is a DIAMOND!

263
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,210
And it's all mine.

264
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,280
Keep your envious little eyes off it!

265
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,120
I found it and it's mine,
fair and square!

266
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,470
Okay, I can do this. I can...

267
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,820
Oh! Wait a minute!

268
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,030
Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!

269
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,150
Fluttershy.

270
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,650
Looks like you've been left behind
by your so-called friends, huh?

271
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,440
Oh, no. I'm certain they're
doing their best to find me.

272
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,190
Well, it must be so upsetting to know how
weak and helpless they think you are.

273
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,580
Not at all!

274
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,070
I *am* weak and helpless and
I appreciate their understanding.

275
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,200
Yes, well... surely it burns you up, I mean...

276
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,590
...that they're always
pointing out your flaws, right?

277
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,060
Not really. In fact...

278
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,010
I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends
who want me to be the best I can be.

279
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,020
Oh, for goodness's sake!

280
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,740
You've been kind for
far too long, my dear.

281
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
Time to be cruel!

282
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,500
Arrivederci!

283
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,690
Fluttershy! I'm so glad
to see your friendly face.

284
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,200
This awful labyrinth is
getting to everypony.

285
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,320
Oh, boo hoo hoo!

286
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,960
Why don't you wave your magic little horn
and make everything all right?

287
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,510
Oh, that's right. You can't.
You don't have one.

288
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,180
What is happening to my friends?

289
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,550
And what are YOU laughing at?!

290
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,800
Chocolate milk!

291
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,060
Little help here?

292
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,930
Thanks, Twilight.

293
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,630
-You're welcome...
-But don't get any ideas about my gem!

294
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,840
I know where you live.

295
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,390
I've got you now, Element.

296
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,330
I can see why you like these
clouds so much. Very plush.

297
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,730
Get off there and put 'em up!
C'mon, let's go!

298
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,660
Hey, I'm here to deliver a message.

299
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,580
I've got a message for you too!

300
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,250
Listen closely. This is important.

301
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,350
A weighty choice is yours to make ‒
The right selection or a big mistake.

302
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,240
If the wrong choice you choose to pursue,
The foundations of home will crumble without you.

303
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,170
Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me...

304
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,790
NO!!!

305
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,490
That box contains your wings.
You can take them and leave the game...

306
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,590
...or you can carry on aimlessly
wandering this maze. Your choice.

307
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,440
Must... find... Rainbow Dash...

308
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,620
As a team... we're unstoppable.

309
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,910
Rainbow Dash won't let us down.

310
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,540
Well, lookie there.

311
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,910
Rainbow Dash is flyin' away.
She's abandonin' us.

312
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,720
Now I know that's a lie.

313
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,970
How can it be?!

314
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,270
Well, well, well. Somepony broke
the "no wings, no magic" rule.

315
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Game's over, my little ponies.

316
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,070
You didn't find your precious elements.

317
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,080
Looks like we might be due
