1
00:00:10,772 --> 00:00:11,592
Whatcha doin'?

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,048
Aaah!

3
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,363
Aaah, yourself.

4
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,962
But that doesn't answer
my question, silly.

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,269
Just some genealogical
research.

6
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:19,709
Ohhhh.

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,704
I don't know
what that is.

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,170
Genealogy is the study
of family history.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,913
You know. Where
ponies comes from,

10
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,247
and who they're
related to.

11
00:00:30,587 --> 00:00:32,359
Ooooh. Fascinating.

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,265
Maybe you should pick
one from the...top.

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,708
Uh-huh.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,510
Interesting.

15
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:45,778
I see.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,246
That makes sense.

17
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:49,352
<i>Not much of a surprise there.</i>

18
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:50,899
<i>WHAT?</i>

19
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,779
THIS IS THE MOST
AMAZING THING EVER!

20
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:56,960
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
HOW AMAZING THIS IS?

21
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:59,096
Genealogy is better
than cotton candy

22
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:01,026
on top of a fountain
of chocolate!

23
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:04,835
You'll never believe who
it says I'm related to!

24
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:09,006
Hey, cousin!

25
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:25,213

<i>This is just</i>
<i>so excitin'!</i>

27
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:54,772
I can't hardly
believe it!

28
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:57,129
I know! Isn't
it the best?

29
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,045
I have another
sister!

30
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,162
I have another
sister!

31
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:02,950
Well, you actually have
a fourth cousin

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,988
<i>twice removed by a</i>
<i>fifth cousin,</i>

33
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,659
<i>but that's like,</i>
<i>exactly like a sister.</i>

34
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:10,511
I try to tone it down a little
bit around non family members,

35
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,515
because I don't want to
make them jealous, but...

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,319
THIS IS THE
BEST FAMILY EVER!

37
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,422
It really is.

38
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,594
You are going to
LOVE being an Apple.

39
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:21,414
I mean, you've got
the playful one...

40
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:26,429
The strong one...

41
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:27,488
EEYUP!

42
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:32,680
And of course,
there's Granny Smith

43
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,378
<i>who knows everything</i>
<i>about everything.</i>

44
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,962
A Ponyville snail can
hibernate for up to 48 moons.

45
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:39,935
Who knew?

46
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:41,843
And then there's me.

47
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:45,722
You smell that sweet
apple air, Pinkie Pie?

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,873
That was rhetorical.

49
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:50,362
Of course, you smell it.
You're an Apple now.

50
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,692
And Applejack is the
one responsible for it!

51
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,686
Aw, Apple Bloom
that is sweet but--

52
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:55,535
It's true!

53
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:58,228
I mean she keeps us all
organized and on schedule

54
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:00,263
and does her own part
on top if it all!

55
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,428
Mm hm!

56
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,841
I was already super
happy as a Pie.

57
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,577
And now I get to be a part
of this amazing family too?

58
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:09,075
It's even more amazing
now that you're in it!

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,055
<i>♪ We're family!</i>
<i>We're family! ♪</i>

61
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:17,092
BEST FAMILY TWIRL EVER!

62
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,085
I just can't believe we
never heard anything

63
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:23,108
about this before.

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,440
Hmmm.

65
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:25,568
What's wrong, sis?

66
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:28,796
I'm not seein' where exactly
it says we're family.

67
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,722
It's riiiiiiiiiiiight....

68
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:35,870
riiiiiiiiiiiight...here!

69
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,623
It is?

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,388
Uh-huh.

71
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:41,609
Applesauce of the Apple family
lineage is a fourth cousin

72
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,492
twice removed of the Pie family.

73
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,415
I see the part about our Great,
Great Auntie Applesauce

74
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:48,150
and fourth cousin
twice removed part,

75
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,499
but that last bit's
awful smudged.

76
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,755
Are you sure it says "Pie"?

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,670
I guess it is a
little smudged.

78
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:56,837
But I see most of it there,

79
00:03:56,942 --> 00:04:00,163
and when I read it, I knew
in my heart it was true.

80
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,887
Well, ain't that just
the sweetest thing.

81
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:06,312
It is, it is.

82
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,478
I'd just hate for us
to get all excited

83
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,968
before we found
out for sure.

84
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:13,268
So how are we supposed
to find out for sure?

85
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,840
Cousin Goldie Delicious!

86
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:21,465
Her cabin's practically an
Apple family history museum.

87
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,569
If anypony has the records
to back up Pinkie's theory,

88
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:25,687
it's her!

89
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,605
I suppose we could always...

90
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:30,558
I mean Goldie Delicious doesn't
live all that far away...

91
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:34,191
<i>And we haven't been on one as</i>
<i>a family in a real long time...</i>

92
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,250
Are y'all thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

93
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,503
FAMILY ROAD TRIP!

94
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,979
Has anypony seen my
travelin' bonnet?

95
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:50,764
Isn't that it on your head?

96
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:52,376
No.

97
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,182
It looks an
awful lot like--

98
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,896
Well, it's ain't.

99
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:57,443
And that's final.

100
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,489
Hey everypony?

101
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:01,281
Since Pinkie Pie is back home
gettin' her stuff for the trip,

102
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,544
can y'all gather round?

103
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,343
I just wanted to say
something real quick.

104
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:08,037
I've had somethin' in my teeth
this whole time, haven't I?

105
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:11,067
Gadsnickety, what a way to
welcome a family member!

106
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:14,768
Uh, no, Granny, your
teeth are fine.

107
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:17,656
I just wanted to be sure that
we're all on the same page

108
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,348
about showin' Pinkie Pie how
awesome a family we really are.

109
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:24,304
We want her to get to know the
family she's been born into!

110
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,291
But like, the best
version of it, you know?

111
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:30,636
Oh! Don't you worry, honey!

112
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:33,888
We're a great family and
she can't help but see it.

113
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:36,850
I bet my future cutie mark's
gonna be a picture of me

114
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:39,041
being the best
behaved pony ever.

115
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:40,830
That's how good
I'm gonna be!

116
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:41,746
<i>Big Mac?</i>

117
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:43,496
Eeyup!

118
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,657
<i>Are you all</i>
<i>ready to go?</i>

119
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,511
Because I'm ready
to go go go!

120
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:53,734
Uh, Big Mac, are you sure we
really need all that stuff?

121
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:55,898
Eeyup.

122
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:57,959
Are you sure you're
strong enough

123
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,480
to really pull
all that stuff?

124
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:01,067
Eeyup!

125
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:04,029
Are you sure the wagon's
strong enough to hold it all?

126
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,212
Eeyup.

127
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,999

Big Mac!

161
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:32,567
I thought you said--

162
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:36,624
I thought, I mean, not
that I'm blaming you,

163
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,915
because we don't blame
in this family,

164
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:41,441
but I thought you
said all this stuff

165
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,309
wasn't gonna be too heavy.

166
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:47,307
How are we supposed to get
to Goldie Delicious now?

167
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:51,758
I don't know, but I don't see
how we can go back now either.

168
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,733
We're closer to cousin
Goldie's than we are to home.

169
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:56,786
I have the best...

170
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:57,711
idea...

171
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:58,817
ever!

172
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:00,944
FAMILY RIVER TRIP!

173
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:04,282
Ha. Just one problem.

174
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:05,945
We haven't got a raft.

175
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,988
About the only thing
that didn't get packed.

176
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:11,121
Well, back in the old days

177
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,283
we used to use the sap
from a sugar pine tree

178
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,827
to glue things together.

179
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,038
That is, uh, fascinatin'.

180
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:20,111
Don't know that it's helpful,
but it is fascinatin'.

181
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,835
Not helpful, my patooty!

182
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,643
We're gonna build
ourselves a raft

183
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:26,212
outta these here jalopy parts

184
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:29,465
and keep it held together
with sugar pine sap.

185
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,268
Hm. Worth a shot.

186
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,269
Whoo hoo!

187
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,912
Could be worse. I guess.

188
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:42,247
Now remember, this time we're
only packin' the necessities.

189
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:43,617
<i>Wait a second!</i>

190
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:47,916
This one is for
the scrapbook.

191
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:52,778
Pinkie Pie, when did
<i>you have time to make this?</i>

192
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:58,700
Applejack, when you're
family, you make the time.

193
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:03,617
Woo-hoo!

194
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:04,960
We did it!

195
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:07,717
Say "Soaked!"

196
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,343
So what you're saying is, if
I have the courage to jump,

197
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,917
the parachute will open.

198
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:21,814
Eeyup!

199
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:24,688
Whoa! That is deep.

200
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:25,607
Eeyup.

201
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,020
Uh-oh.

202
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,339
All right, y'all.

203
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,218
Please tell me that the
map didn't get wet.

204
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:34,675
<i>'Cause it looks like I'm</i>
<i>gonna need it right about now.</i>

205
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:39,330
Found it!

206
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,477
<i>♪ Who's got the map?</i>
<i>I got the map. ♪</i>

207

209
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:46,915
I'm Apple-- Uh-oh.

210
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,228
Oh!

211
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,792
All you had to do
was bring it to me.

212
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:01,475
No singin', no
dancin', no games.

213
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:02,796
Just walk it over.

214
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:03,964
Eeyup.

215
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,273
Say, "Best siblings ever!"

216
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:09,506
That's another keeper!

217
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,278
<i>It's OK, y'all!</i>

218
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,274
I traveled down this
river as a filly

219
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:15,385
and I know it like
the back of my hoof!

220
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:19,432
Are you sure you
know which way to go?

221
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,615
Does a june bug like
to hide in a tree?

222
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:23,482
Uh... I don't know.

223
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,361
Well, I do know.

224
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,479
<i>And I also know we</i>
<i>wanna head Southeast.</i>

225
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,180
Now step aside, young 'un.

226
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,052
Um, Granny?

227
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:35,301
Uh huh?

228
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,457
<i>Are we supposed to</i>
<i>go through a cave?</i>

229
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:39,297
Don't worry, child.

230
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:42,345
The scariest cave in Equestria
was down that other way.

231
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,799
The scariest cave
in Equestria?

232
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:47,631
Oh, it's a fright
all right.

233
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,323
Filled with creatures that'll
eat ya soon as look at ya.

234
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:52,811
Oooh! Sounds scary.

235
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:54,120
Tell us more.

236
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,111
<i>Ponies go in.</i>

237
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:58,154
<i>But they never come out.</i>

238
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,886
And you're sure
it's not that cave?

239
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,693
The one we're
headin' straight for?

240
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:08,066
Now Applejack, I
taught you better

241
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,314
than to question
your elder ponies.

242
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,880
You sure did.

243
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:15,557
All righty, then.

244
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,924
Now everypony just sit on back
and leave the steerin'

245
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,682
to your old Granny Smith.

246
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:29,775
<i>See now. Told you</i>
<i>this was--</i>

247
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:34,271
<i>Got it!</i>

248
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,483
<i>Best scary unidentifiable</i>
<i>creature ever.</i>

249
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:42,282
<i>Say "Terrified!"</i>

250
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:52,608
Guess that was the scariest
cave in Equestria.

251
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,123
Of course, I meant to
take us through it.

252
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,363
Unexpected adventure
is good for the soul!

253
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,484
Best Granny
wisdom ever!

254
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,382
Uh-huh.

255
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:05,297
Why don't you just scooch
on over there, Granny?

256
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:07,539
Think I'll take it
from here on out.

257
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:11,781
Is that how I taught you
to treat your elder ponies?

258
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,890
Oooh. Oooh. Is it?

259
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:17,393
You taught me to
trust my common sense.

260
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:18,942
And my common sense says

261
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:22,171
we should get to Goldie
Delicious' cabin in one piece!

262
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,219
And that is exactly
what I'm gonna do!

263
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:27,404
That is mighty
generous of you,

264
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,840
but I think you've done
enough for one day.

265
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,315
And how exactly are you
gonna know which way to go?

266
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,781
Hmmmmm?

267
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:40,035
It would be easier if the
map hadn't gone overboard.

268
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,043
Hey! There wouldn't have
been an overboard

269
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,180
if Big Mac hadn't
overpacked the jalopy.

270
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:47,285
Eeyup. Hey!

271
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,883
Exactly.

272
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:52,374
So I think we can all agree
that from here on out,

273
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,626
I should be in
charge of everything.

274
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:12,405
Heh heh.

275
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:18,132
I just want to say that I think
you are all super-duper

276
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:19,980
and I can't wait to make
the page in my scrapbook

277
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,208
about the amazing
waterfall we went down.

278
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:45,607
<i>Wheeeee!</i>

279
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:01,644
Told ya that sugar pine sap
would hold this thing together.

280
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:15,783
We're here! We're here!

281
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:17,955
We made it to
Goldie Delicious'!

282
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:21,900
You guys! There's a note!

283
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,235
Uh, Pinkie Pie?

284
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,467
Maybe you could read
that one out loud?

285
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,726
Oh right, sorry! I
haven't even read it yet,

286
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:35,744
I was just looking at
how pretty the paper is.

287
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,599
OK! It says that she ran
off to run some errands

288
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:39,728
but will be home soon.

289
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:41,600
Ah! That's perfect!

290
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:43,804
Why is that perfect?

291
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,763
Because it will
give me enough time

292
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:47,159
to get more
scrapbook paper!

293
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:48,405
See ya!

294
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:52,511
Worst family road
trip. Ever.

295
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:54,040
Eeyup.

296
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,171
I can't believe she
witnessed our family

297
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,814
falling apart like this.

298
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:01,240
I can't believe I was
arguing with you so much

299
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,740
that I tore the
wheel right off the raft.

300
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,007
It's like I wasn't
myself at all.

301
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:08,612
Aw, that wasn't
your fault.

302
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:11,557
My stubborn streak got a
holda me somethin' fierce.

303
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,505
I shoulda let you take the
wheel long before that.

304
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,047
It was my fault the
map got all wet.

305
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:18,333
I was the pony..

306
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:21,691
Now now, Big Mac, you
gotta know we forgive you

307
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:24,214
for packin' the jalopy so
much that it collapsed.

308
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,347
You was just eager to please
Pinkie Pie like the rest of us.

309
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:31,717
Everypony, I think we have
to let Pinkie Pie know

310
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:34,085
that even if she does
discover that she's an Apple,

311
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:37,313
she does not have to feel
obliged to consider herself one.

312
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,525
Sure as apple sauce.

313
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:41,650
<i>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</i>

314
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,944
You guys are the
best family ever!

315
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:46,448
How can you say that?

316
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:50,277
We started out as one big
unit and now look at us.

317
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:52,284
Yeah! NOW look at you!

318
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,448
You're all here still
in one big unit,

319
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:57,145
<i>loving each other and owning</i>
<i>up to what went wrong!</i>

320
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:00,021
You never gave up, even
when things got tough!

321
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:02,380
She does make a
pretty good point.

322
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:05,678
You aren't just family,
you're best friends!

323
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:08,413
And I want to be an
Apple more than ever!

324
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:10,472
And we want you
to be one too!

325
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,651
Yippee! Hee hee hee!

326
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,428
<i>Now that's how</i>
<i>you run an errand.</i>

327
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,998
HELLLLLO!

328
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:20,343
Hello, yourself.

329
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,168
You must be Goldie Delicious;
so nice to meet you!

330
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:25,730
And who exactly are you?

331
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:27,943
We're Apples!

332
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,323
Well, we think
we're all Apples.

333
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:32,803
But we need your help findin'
out if Pinkie Pie here

334
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:34,476
is our fourth cousin
twice removed.

335
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:36,729
Why didn't you say so?

336
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,993
If anypony can help solve this
genealogy mystery, it's me.

337
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:48,550
I am sorry about this.

338
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:51,551
I wasn't exactly
expectin' company.

339
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,506
Let me try to
squeeze in here.

340
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:59,871
Get some oil ... the
hinges, heh heh heh.

341
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,496
All right then!

342
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,524
Just have to move a few things
out of the way of the door.

343
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:07,024
Ooh! Ah! Get off of
that, Mr. Puppy.

344
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,446
<i>Come on, sweetheart.</i>

345
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,963
Come on in!

346
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:16,938
Sorry about the mess.

347
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:27,479
Whoa!

348
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,481
Careful now.

349
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:32,257
Those belonged to your Great,
Great, Great, Uncle Apple Tart.

350
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:33,732
Whose was this?

351
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,237
<i>That was my lunch.</i>

352
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,747
<i>A couple weeks ago.</i>

353
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:51,900
And this here is the complete
record of our family tree.

354
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:58,565
It's not here, or here or here,
it certainly isn't here, is it.

355
00:18:58,967 --> 00:18:59,740
Oh, here it is!

356
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:01,141
Oh dear.

357
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,786
"Oh dear"? What is it?

358
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:04,934
Am I not an
Apple after all?

359
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,164
That's just it.
I don't know!

360
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:08,856
The page is all smudged!

361
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:15,299
I sure am sorry, but I don't
think I can help you after all.

362
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,753
Don't be sorry.

363
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:17,943
It's OK.

364
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:20,731
I'm just a little disappointed
that I'll never know for sure

365
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,347
if I'm a part of this family.

366
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:25,194
Well, I know for sure!

367
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:26,423
What do you mean?

368
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:27,693
You can't know.

369
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:30,234
I can know for sure
that it doesn't matter

370
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:32,749
what the book says
or doesn't say.

371
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,634
After all you've
been through with us,

372
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,111
and all you've put up with,

373
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,818
it's obvious you're
an Apple to the core!

374
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,303
Darn tootin'!

375
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:42,801
Yes-siree!

376
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:44,540
Eeyup!

377
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:51,084
Say "Best family hug ever!"

378
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:53,633
Best family hug ever!

379
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,706
Thanks again for
the wagon, Goldie!

380
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:06,060
See you soon!

381
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,413
Y'all sure you don't want
to take any of these

382
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,400
Apple family heirlooms
home with ya?

383
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:16,396
Nnope.

384

388
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,444
Twilight agreed this was
definitely an experience

389
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:43,525
worth puttin' in the journal.

390
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:46,095
Think I'll write about
how bein' a good family

391
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,691
isn't about bein' perfect

392
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,927
as much as it is about
bein' able to get through

393
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,120
the rough patches together.

394
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:53,984
About bein' able to forgive
each other for mistakes.

395
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:56,280
Don't forget to mention how
really good friends

396
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:57,779
can also feel like
your family.

397
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:58,926
Eeyup.

398
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,000
You know what?

399
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,456
Maybe I should write it.

400
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,565
I'm good at makin'
things sound excitin'.

401
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:07,562
I have a history of
excellent story telling.

402
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,432
I should probably
do it-- Hey!

403
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:11,769
Where in the haystack do
you think you're going

404
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:12,952
with that there pen?

405
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:20,975
Look at me; I'm part of the
Apply family too. I'm arguing!

406
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,611
