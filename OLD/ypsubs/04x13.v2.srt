1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,420
Wow! I can't believe how
many ponies showed up.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,370
<i>I can.</i>

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,540
<i>I mean, finding out who</i>
<i>the Ponyville Days</i>

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,770
<i>Pony of Ceremonies is,</i>
<i>is a pretty big deal.</i>

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,960
I didn't know Granny Smith was
on the Selection Committee.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,270
Of course she is.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,050
<i>Ponyville Days celebrates</i>
<i>the founding of Ponyville</i>

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,860
<i>and she was right there.</i>

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,840
I'm glad the Committee didn't
automatically pick me

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,060
so everypony gets
a chance to see

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,320
how great being
me actually is,

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,020
even though the Festival
is basically a party

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,700
and the Pony of Ceremonies
organizes the whole thing

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,330
so it would make
sense if they picked me.

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,250
Shhhhhh!

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,760
Citizens of Ponyville,

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,880
this year's applicants
were all exceptional,

18
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,730
but there can only be
one Ponyville Days

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,460
Pony of Ceremonies.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,930
And that pony is...

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,880
Rarity!

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,490
<i>Whoo whee!</i>
<i>All right, Rarity!</i>

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,260
Congratulations, Rarity.

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,650
Do you know what
you're going to do?

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,890
Oh, I might have a few ideas.

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,260

27
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,310
I'm so excited for the Festival
I can hardly stand up straight.

28
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,260
Me, too. I'm glad
Rarity was picked.

29
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,040
I know she'll add a touch of
elegance to the whole thing.

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,740
Probably more than a touch.

31
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,500
Ahem.

32
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,650
This year's Ponyville Days
Festival designed by Rarity,

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,290
will feature various high
class events, such as...

34
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,230
<i>A silent cider</i>
<i>auction and tasting...</i>

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,030
Ooooh!

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,700
<i>A Ponyville gala</i>
<i>in Town Square...</i>

37
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,500
<i>Aaaaah!</i>

38
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,130
<i>And, of course, a</i>
<i>Ponyville fashion show.</i>

39
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,860
<i>Ooooooh!</i>

40
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,910
This year's Ponyville Days
Festival pony of ceremonies,

41
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,590
creates shimmering
couture of her own design.

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,890
And the theme is,

43
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,910
Small Town Chic!

44
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,900
Wow, Rarity! You really have
put a lot of effort into this.

45
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,910
I'll say.

46
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,260
I think it's going
to be magical.

47
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,290
Do you really think so?

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,540
Are you kidding?
I can't wait!

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,580
Oh, that's such a relief.

50
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,260
But, of course, I couldn't
possibly do it all on my own.

51
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,820
The festival is in three days!

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,080
Pinkie Pie and I can hang
lights and decorations

53
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,050
in the Town Square.

54
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,350
And I can get Sweet Apple Acres
all ready for the cider tasting.

55
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,500
That's just perfect.

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,570
And now Twilight, if you and
Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,710
with the fashion show...

58
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,800
Of course.

59
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,820
I'd be honored.

60
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,980
I can focus on the one thing
I'm worried about most of all.

61
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,330
<i>What?</i>

62
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,080
Creating a Ponyville
Days Festival

63
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,080
fantastic enough to impress...

64
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,870
TRENDERHOOF!

65
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,470
Uh, who's Trenderhoof?

66
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,280
WHAT?

67
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,120
How can you not know
who Trenderhoof is?

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,190
Trenderhoof is only
the most amazing,

69
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,550
handsomest travel writer to
have ever traveled or written.

70
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,650
Before Las Pegasus became an
Equestria travel destination,

71
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,830
he wrote about it.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,050
Before the culinary
revolution in Trottingham,

73
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,580
he discovered it.

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,670
He knows what's going to be hot
even before it's tepid.

75
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,270
Sounds like somepony has
a little bit of a crush.

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,010
Oh, Twilight.

77
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,370
"Crush" doesn't even
begin to describe it!

78
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,210
He's practically divine.

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S COMING!

80
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,200
Thank you ever so much
for joining me, Twilight.

81
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,040
I don't think I could have
met Trenderhoof on my own.

82
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,800
It's no problem, but you
shouldn't be nervous

83
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,700
about meeting him.

84
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,340
Is that him? Do you see him?
Twilight, is he there?

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,860
Uh...I'm not sure.

86
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,910
You don't suppose he
decided not to come?

87
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,250
Twilight, I don't see him!

88
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,720
What if he doesn't arrive?

89
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,730
The whole festival
will be a disaster!

90
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,310
TWILIGHT, WHERE IS HE?

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,690
Ahem. Sorry.

92
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,150
Rarity, you have to
get a hold of yourself.

93
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,000
I mean, you haven't
even met him yet...

94
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,030
What's wrong?

95
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,670
Shhhhhhh.

96
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,520
It's him, it's him, it's
him, he's here, it's him.

97
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,740
Well, go up and talk to him.

98
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,490
I can't.

99
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,730
Um... Hi. Ahem.

100
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Hello. Mr. Trenderhoof.

101
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,360
I am Rarity and I have been
chosen as Pony of Ceremonies

102
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,180
for the Ponyville Days Festival.

103
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,790
Please.

104
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,070
Call me Trend.

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,090
And over here will be the
climax of the Festival,

106
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
The Ponyville Days Gala.

107
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,150
Music. Dancing.

108
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,710
And of course a locally sourced
menu of delicious treats.

109
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,710
Reminds me of the Spring Fling
meets Manehattan Wedding

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
I wrote about in
Gallop & Prance.

111
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,570
Exactly! I can't
even describe

112
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,670
how much your work
has influenced me.

113
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,530
And finally, Sweet Apple Acres.

114
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,410
Ponyville's core, heh
heh, so to speak,

115
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,710
<i>where our quaint</i>
<i>little hamlet began.</i>

116
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,090
<i>Oh! Breathtaking!</i>

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,060
I've heard about it, of course,
but to see it in verite,

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,280
to stand on the soil
of a working farm.

119
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,410
You can really feel
the authenticity.

120
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,390
Oh yes! Uh, they really
do grow apples here.

121
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,000
Thank you, Rarity.

122
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,060
Thank you for
bringing me here.

123
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,970
This farm is truly
something special.

124
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,260
I had planned to transform it
into an elegant country inn

125
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,010
for the Festival,

126
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,290
but now I see just how
special it is au natural.

127
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,760
Au natural, indeed.

128
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,480
Who.

129
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,640
Is.

130
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,730
That?

131
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,540
Who? Applejack?

132
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,500
Ahem.

133
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,960
Why are you staring
at her like that?

134
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,600
I've seen a lot in
my travels, but...

135
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,760
I've never beheld such beauty.

136
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,790
<i>Applejack.</i>

137
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,040
The pony of my dreams.

138
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,810
<i>Rarity?</i>

139
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,110
Rarity?

140
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,430
Hello?

141
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,160
I brought my cider
tasting cup.

142
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,900
Are you ready to
go try the samples?

143
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,950
What's the point?

144
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,010
Rarity, what's wrong?

145
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,390
Nothing.

146
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,390
Is it something I said?

147
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,810
He doesn't like me.

148
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:29,700
What?

149
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,830
He doesn't like me.

150
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,220
Rarity, I can't hear--

151
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,070
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE
HE HAS A CRUSH ON APPLEJACK

152
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,830
EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD
A CRUSH ON HIM EVER SINCE

153
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,600
THE BEGINNING OF TIME
AND IT'S NOT FAIR!

154
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,360
Trenderhoof doesn't like you?

155
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,070
That's ridiculous.

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,190
Oh, Spike, how could you
ever know what it's like

157
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,080
to be totally
obsessed with a pony

158
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,920
only to find out
they're obsessed

159
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,900
with somepony else?

160
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,910
I mean, what could Applejack
possibly have that I don't?

161
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,960
Hmmm.

162
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,880
You know, I have such
respect for the work ethic

163
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,000
of Earth Ponies.

164
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,540
Uh, gee, thanks.

165
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,470
Granny Smith always said,
"Pick an apple a day

166
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,610
and keep trouble away."

167
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,480
How many varieties of
apples do you think there are?

168
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,730
On the farm or in all
of Equestria because--

169
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,760
I once had
an apple so rare,

170
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,080
they thought it
was extinct.

171
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,200
I ate four of them.

172
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,060
Is that a fact?

173
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,390
That's my thing.

174
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,770
I take the mundane,
the simple, the...

175
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,190
unappreciated, and
I make it relatable.

176
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,850
Well, I hope you can
relate to Ponyville.

177
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,070
Me too.

178
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,390
But enough about me.

179
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
I want to know about you.

180
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,870
What do apples
mean to Applejack?

181
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,470
Look, I'm glad you're
interested in Ponyville and all,

182
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,660
but I'm kinda busy
with my chores

183
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,120
and if I can't get 'em done,

184
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,360
there won't be a
Ponyville Days Festival

185
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,390
for you to write about.

186
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,580
<i>Well, that</i>
<i>will never do!</i>

187
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,590
Rarity, what are you wearing?

188
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,870
What, this old thing?

189
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,270
Aren't you too busy
planning the Festival

190
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,900
to keep making new
outfits for it?

191
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,670
I am, but the thought of
hauling apples inspired me

192
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,400
and I just couldn't
stop myself.

193
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,320
Really?

194
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,370
If there's one thing I
love, it's hauling apples.

195
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,360
I'm growing fond
of it, myself.

196
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,530
Maybe you two should
try it sometime.

197
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,070
I'm feeling a tad inspired.

198
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,990
<i>♪ Without farm life there'd</i>
<i>be such disparity. ♪</i>

199
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,960
<i>♪ These thoughts I think</i>
<i>with great clarity. ♪</i>

200
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,100
<i>♪ Apples high to the sky,</i>
<i>She's the one of my eye. ♪</i>

201
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,170
<i>That fruit hauling</i>
<i>pony named..♪.</i>

202
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,470
<i>♪ ...Applejack. </i>

203
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,870
Rarity, why do you
want to plow a field?

204
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,230
Is it me or could this
use a splash of color,

205
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
and maybe a wash?

206
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,220
Don't we need to check
on the gala decorations?

207
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,440
Yes, yes. Of course.

208
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,890
But Trend obviously has
a thing for farm life.

209
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,050
If I can't convince him that
I'm just as much of a farm hoof

210
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,930
as Applejack, I'll never get him
interested in the Festival.

211
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
The Festival.

212
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,380
Right.

213
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,670
And I do appreciate
your help ever so much.

214
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,010
I couldn't do a thing
without you Spikey pooo.

215
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,070
Well... that's what
friends are for.

216
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,430
Right! So!

217
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,500
Come... On... farm thing!

218
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,720
How does Applejack do it?

219
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,380
<i>Well, it would help</i>
<i>if the harness was on right.</i>

220
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,650
What are you doing?

221
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,190
I'm simply lending a
hoof with the chores...

222
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,970
...which I love
doing ever so much.

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,550
Well, if you're still
interested after the Festival,

224
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,870
I can teach you all about it.

225
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,600
But right now, I need to get the
plowing done if you don't mind.

226
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,560
Not at all.

227
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,180
She makes it look so easy.

228
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,690
I know.

229
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,040
Isn't she fantastic?

230
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,870
I really don't see what
the fuss is all about.

231
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,850
Now, Rarity, you be careful.

232
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,260
If you don't get the
bucking just right,

233
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,740
<i>you could sprain a hoof.</i>

234
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,870
I am perfectly familiar with
the applebucking process,

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,910
thank you very much, but while
you seem to rely on raw power,

236
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,790
I believe a certain amount
of style is required.

237
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,710
It's really more of a
dance, if you ask me.

238
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,280
Et voilà.

239
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,190
Well, your way is
definitely long on style.

240
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,390
Thank you.

241
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,520
Now if you'll all excuse me,
I have some more chores to do.

242
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
Inside!

243
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,870
Rarity, can I ask
you something?

244
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,340
Why, Trend, you can
ask me anything.

245
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,810
I've been meaning to ask
for a while and, frankly,

246
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,490
I'm sort of embarrassed.

247
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,830
Rarity...

248
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,980
Do you think Applejack would
be my date for the Festival?

249
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,090
Why don't you go ask
her yourself?

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,410
Phew!

251
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,010
That was close.

252
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,330
If you've come to apologize,
there's really no need.

253
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,140
What are you talking about?

254
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,750
Let's dispense with
the charade, shall we?

255
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,740
Listen, I know you really
want Trend to like you.

256
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,910
And he does.

257
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,640
Despite somepony's
best efforts.

258
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,400
I swear, I don't know why he's
paying so much attention to me.

259
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,640
And I don't know anypony who's
that interested in farming.

260
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,850
Not even me.

261
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,370
Well, maybe it's time Trend
met a real country pony.

262
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,390
Shouldn't you be
working on the Festival

263
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,910
<i>instead of coming up with</i>
<i>new ways to impress Trend?</i>

264
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,990
Oh, I'm sure you'd love that.

265
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,570
Well, I have a new
vision for the Festival.

266
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,640
And it's gonna be more country

267
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,100
than the whole Apple
Family put together!

268
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,130
Um, Isn't it a little late
to be changing the theme?

269
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,250
Applejack, what's going on?

270
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,420
I'm too scared to guess.

271
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,610
<i> Firstly, I just wanna</i>
<i>thank you'all for comin'</i>

272
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,260
<i>and second I know</i>
<i>y'all will all adore</i>

273
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,310
<i>my new Festival theme...</i>

274
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,790
Simple Ways!

275
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,730
Well, what's so funny?

276
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,650
Rarity, that is the silliest
getup I have ever seen.

277
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,760
It is a little funny.

278
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,830
Funny?

279
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,960
Rarity, you aren't
serious, are you?

280
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,560
Well, of course I'm serious!

281
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,760
Ahem...

282
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,690
Why wouldn't I be?

283
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,340
Because you would
never dress like that.

284
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,910
You like fashion and high
society and fancy things.

285
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,610
And I can like plowing fields
and hauling apples just as much.

286
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,650
But you don't!

287
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,630
How do you know
what I like?

288
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,360
Because I know you.

289
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,390
Well, maybe you don't know
me as well as you think.

290
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,940
And I suppose it's just a
coincidence that Trenderhoof

291
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,140
seems so interested
in country life too?

292
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,680
I don't know what
you're gettin' at.

293
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,070
Well, then I guess I'll
just have to show you.

294
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,480
Be my guest.

295
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,220
Now, if y'all will excuse
me, I have a hootenanny

296
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,310
of a Festival to put on.

297
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,810
Now, to be a model in the
Simple Ways fashion show,

298
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,560
you might think simple
means less is more.

299
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,170
Well, that just ain't so.

300
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,260
If you want to be real
simple, more is more.

301
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,080
Now y'all go off and make
yourselves look just like that.

302
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,460
Who's our next model
for the fashion show?

303
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,560
Um...

304
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,840
Apple Jewel?

305
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,070
Who the hay is that?

306
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,750
Is this some kinda joke?

307
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,270
Why, Rarity, what ever would
make you think I was joking?

308
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,250
Because you would never
wear an ensemble like that!

309
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,730
You like plowing fields
and hauling apples...

310
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,510
And I can like
fashion just as much.

311
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,870
But you don't!

312
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,830
Well, maybe you do not know
me as well as you think.

313
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,930
Fine.

314
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,630
But I got a whole
Festival to plan,

315
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,190
so if you're gonna start
modelin', just get on with it.

316
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Life is a festival, and you
should celebrate it

317
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,920
by looking just like me, because
I'm a trend-setting Fashionista!

318
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,880
You're a trend-setting
Fashionista?

319
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,090
Why that's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever--

320
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,390
I mean, good for you.

321
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,320
I, on the other hoof, couldn't
care less how I look

322
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,020
long as I get the chores done.

323
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,800
Oh? Is that so?

324
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,020
Yes indeedy doodle.

325
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,950
Not me.

326
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,090
My mane needs to be perfectly
coiffed at all times.

327
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,400
Well, my mane is full
of dust and split ends.

328
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,240
My hooves are so polished you
can see your reflection in them.

329
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,130
My hooves are cracked and dry
from working in the fields!

330
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,560
I'm so fashion forward.

331
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,030
I wear droopy drawers.

332
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,380
I smell like rosebuds.

333
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,370
I LOVE BEING COVERED IN MUD!

334
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,530
Goodness! Your couture!

335
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,550
Oh, it's bad.

336
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,990
Will somepony
bring me a towel

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,330
to wipe this repulsive
filth from my hooves!

338
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,500
There's the Rarity I know!

339
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,720
Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry
I said all those things.

340
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,040
You're a true friend who
probably knows me better

341
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,000
than I know myself.

342
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,070
I don't know what I was thinking
wearing this ridiculous outfit.

343
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,730
I kinda know how you feel.

344
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,040
But you were just trying to help
me see how silly I was being.

345
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,010
And you were right.

346
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,470
Besides, that gown
looks just gorgeous on you.

347
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,850
I wish I hadn't ruined it.

348
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,780
Thanks. It's
nice ain't it?

349
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,350
It's magnificent!

350
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,840
Wherever did
you get it?

351
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,890
Oh. It's uh... one of yours.

352
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,370
I'll need 3 gallons of boiling
water and one ounce of detergent

353
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,040
START!

354
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,250
I'm moving to Ponyville!

355
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,930
Being the most interesting Pony
in Equestria is exhausting.

356
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,890
I want to leave my exotic,
exciting life behind

357
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,140
and live on a farm.

358
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,220
What?

359
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,010
Well, that's real nice, but I
sure hope you weren't thinking

360
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,160
of Sweet Apple Acres.

361
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,710
Oh.

362
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,540
Look, you're a fine
pony, but uh, well, I'm...

363
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,020
I think what Applejack
is trying to say,

364
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,510
is that there's something
unappealing about a pony

365
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,550
who'd change themselves so much
just to impress somepony else.

366
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,210
If somepony doesn't like you for
who you are, it's their loss.

367
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,490
Well, this is awkward.

368
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,660
Not at all.

369
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,700
In fact...

370
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,100
I think I know
just how you feel.

371
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,840
What do you think, Rarity?

372
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,820
Is it too late to go
back to Small Town Chic?

373
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,520
Not if I can help it!

374
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,310
<i>Organizing the</i>
<i>Ponyville Days Celebration</i>

375
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,630
<i>was one of the hardest</i>
<i>things I've ever done...</i>

376
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,560
<i>But I learned an</i>
<i>important lesson.</i>

377
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,700
<i>Real friends will like</i>
<i>you for who you are</i>

378
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,410
and changing yourself to impress
them is no way to make new ones.

379
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,470
<i>And when you're as</i>
<i>fabulous as I am...</i>

380
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,860
<i>it's practically a crime.</i>
