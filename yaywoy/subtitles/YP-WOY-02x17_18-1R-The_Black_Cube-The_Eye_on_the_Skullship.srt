        providing you           

114
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,021
       with a gratuity          
  for all of your fine work.    

115
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,856
            Ahem.

           Let's see.           

119
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,141
I'll take a quadruple splatty

120
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,976
  no pickles, extra cheese,     
       seven pickles...         

121
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,878
ketchup, catsup, no sesame seeds
       of the top bun,          

122
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,980
glue 'em onto the bottom bun,   
      throw out the bun         

123
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,749
   and put the whole thing      
          in a wrap,            

124
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,152

was to be a good guy for once,

226
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,230
     <i> I know who you are,</i>       
            <i> Andy.</i>              

227
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,798
   <i> This is Commander Peepers.</i>  

228
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
  <i> Once again, your request</i>     
   <i> to interview Lord Hater</i>     

229
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,869
<i>has been rejected on grounds</i>    
   <i> that it's not your job</i>      

230
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,403
  <i> to make this stupid show!</i>    

231
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,240
        Well, it's not          
       my job, per se,          

232
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,308
    but you know, I think       
it's my duty to help enlighten--

233
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,443
       Just keep an eye         
       on your sector.          

234
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,577
      Yes, sir. Always do.      

235
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,313
       <i> No, you don't!!</i>         

236
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,550
     Well, slight change        
          of plans.             

237
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,419
    Looks like we won't be      
    talking to Lord Hater.      

238
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,721
        But fret not,           
        dear viewers.           

239
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,723
        I know you're           
      dying to see him,         

240
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,993
     and I won't give up        
     until I give you...        

241
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,761
        ( stammering )          
        what you want.          

242
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,630
       In the meantime,         
  I bet you're wonderin'...     

243
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,333
      What's for lunch?         

244
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,968
          ( sighs )             
        That's right.           

245
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,337
     It's the 453rd time        
         we find out            

246
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,475
  exactly what the Watchdogs    
    are eating for lunch.       

247
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,343
          Excuse me,            
       fellow Watchdog.         

248
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,345
       What refreshing          
    and replenishing meal       

249
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,414
     has been graciously        
         given to you           

250
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,416
    by our generous leader      
         Lord Hater?            

251
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,352
                 Oh, wow.       

252
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,188
           Uh, hi.              

253
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,857
 Um, apparently, I have never   
been on live television before, 

254
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,459
       and apparently,          
    I'm having enchiladas.      

255
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,295
         Apparently.            

256
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,930
          Fascinating.          

257
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,265
    - And what delicious--      
        - Enchiladas!           

258
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,467
        ( all cheering )        

259
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,336
         Enchiladas!            

260
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,171
Chef, tell us,                  
enchiladas.                     

261
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,140
Was this meal                   
specifically chosen             

262
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,808
by Lord Hater's decree?         

263
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,044
                   Uh... no.    

264
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,546
                 Taco Tuesday   
                 was yesterday, 

265
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,815
                   so there was 
                   leftovers,   

266
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,985
                  and I decided 
                  to make, uh,  
                  enchiladas.   

267
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,553
Hmm, interesting.               

268
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,456
So does Lord Hater              
like enchiladas?                

269
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,825
                  I don't know. 

270
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,361
   All I know is, I didn't want 
   the stuff to go to waste,    

271
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,530
          so I reused it today. 

272
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,565
Hm, yes.                        
But Lord Hater--                

273
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,467
          See, the thing with...

274
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,769
                The thing with  
                ground beef is, 
                you gotta...    

275
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,141
     Self-defense, where        
the Watchdogs closest to Hater, 

276
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,843
    his elite ground troops,    

277
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,346
      learn the fine art        
        of conquering.          

278
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:42,647
     And if we're lucky,        

279
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,382
    Lord Hater might make       
      a surprise pop-in         

280
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,351
     to inspect the troops.     

281
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,853
     To be the best takes       
  months of intense training    

282
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,589
        in areas like           
  Advanced Sylvia Defense...    

283
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,531
       And, of course,          
  Wander Avoidance Tactics.     

284
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,100
       I know he wants          
      to be your friend.        

285
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,369
       I know he wants          
   to play carnival games.      

286
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,272
       I know he knows          
       all your names,          

287
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,773
                  and birthdays,

288
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,608
        and how you like        
        to spend a rainy Sunday 

289
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,077
        with a crossword        
        and a cup of chamomile. 

290
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,513
     I mean, he is really       
     not such a bad guy.        

291
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,218
     No! Wander is pure,        
     unadulterated love.        

292
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
    I'm sure our resident       
       drill instructor         

293
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,923
         has a host of exciting 
         Hater stories          
         to share with us.      

294
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,724
You're darn right I do.         
One time...                     

295
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,259
                          Andy! 

296
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,861
        Why aren't you          
        at your post?           

297
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,195
        Uh, gotta go.           
      See you next time.        

298
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,602
       We are live from         
          Level H8,             

299
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,404
     Hater's private floor.     

300
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,472
      Only Watchdogs in         
     Hater's inner circle       

301
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,408
        are allowed on          
         this level.            

302
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,910
 I hope to speak with someone   
close to the big man himself.   

303
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,645
      Though it's risky,        
        it's worth it,          

304
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,882
  because this is the story     
every Watchdog is waiting for.  

305
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,517
          I wonder who we'll... 

306
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,488
                    Oh, my gosh.

307
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,658
    That was Captain Tim,       
  Lord Hater's personal pet.    

308
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,961
     This is a sure-fire        
          exclusive.            

309
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,898
 We're here with Lord Hater's   
 personal pet and dog walker.   

310
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,167
      Wow. What I wouldn't give 
      to work so closely        

311
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,235
   - with our great leader.     
        - Be my guest.          

312
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,747
       Welcome again to         
   <i> Eye On the Skull Ship.</i>      

313
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,482
  Thanks to some of the guys    
      in the infirmary,         

314
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,584
     I was able to secure       
      an exclusive place        

315
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:30,688
  at one of Hater's rallies!    
       Whoo... ow, ow!          

316
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,626
       ( Hater speaking         
        indistinctly )          

317
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,328
       Fear not, viewers.       

318
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,863
     Though I can barely        
         see or hear            

319
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,099
     our esteemed leader,       
        I assure you,           

320
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:44,702
 I will get at least some of    
the Hater coverage you demanded.

321
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,504
      ( Hater continues         
          speaking )            

322
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,674
      He's talking about        
his hated rival Lord Dominator. 

323
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,609
              Boo!              

324
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,181
    And now he's saying...      
 he'll conquer... her heart?    

325
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,850
      That can't be right.      

326
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,152
             ( Peepers shouting 
             indistinctly )     

327
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:05,189
  Well, Peepers seems to be     
getting very upset about this.  

328
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,159
Hater's pulling out what appears
    to be some kind of...       

329
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,928
    It's the T-shirt cannon!    

330
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,842
          ( groaning )          

331
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,912
   Oh... "I heart Dominator."   

332
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,882
            Oh, boy.            

333
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,684
         Hello, all.            

334
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,820
  After a serious close call    
   with Commander Peepers,      

335
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,423
       your humble host         
  has decided to do the show    

336
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:41,159
 entirely from the safety of    
     his security office,       

337
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,928
     so he won't get fired.     

338
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,030
    But you won't believe       
        who stopped by          

339
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,598
   for a little chat with us.   

340
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,369
       The one and only         
         Lord Hater!            

341
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,771
     Hi, Andy. It sure is       
     an honor to be here.       

342
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,740
    Huge fan of the show.       

343
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,042
Really?                         
Oh, well, sir,                  

344
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,178
that really means               
the world to me.                

345
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,013
    And each and every one      
       of you Watchdogs         

346
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,048
        mean the world          
         to me, Andy.           

347
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,517
  In fact, I'd like to thank    
      all the Watchdogs         

348
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,619
          for their             
      tireless service.         

349
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,855
  They're truly the backbone    
  of the skull ship, and...     

350
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,091
Oh, who am I kidding?           

351
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,093
 I'm sorry, everyone.           

352
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,628
I was a fool to think           
I could give you                
a good show.                    

353
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,764
I'll never get                  
a Lord Hater interview.         

354
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,603
     Hey, uh, my printer        
       stopped working.         

355
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,271
          It says I need toner. 

356
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,307
         Are you Toner?         

357
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,276
      I, uh... I, uh...         

358
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,883
                You do TV here? 

359
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,251
( stammering )                  
Uh, yes, sir.                   

360
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,986
Unless that would               
get me in trouble,              

361
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,454
 in which case, no.             

362
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,623
       How many people          
       watch your show?         

363
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,726
      - Oh, it goes out         
      all over.                 
      - All over, huh?          

364
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,129
   Dear viewers, it is with     
      the deepest pride         

365
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,464
    that I present to you       
      the man, the myth,        

366
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,833
          the leader            
    I'm honored to serve.       

367
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,735
         The greatest           
        in the galaxy.          

368
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,303
   Lord Hater.                  

369
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,506
 Lord Hater, how are you?       

370
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,673
               Good to be here, 
               Toner.           

371
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,809
          Listen up,            
       and listen good.         

372
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,310
    All you poser villains      
          out there             

373
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,080
       better recognize         
  who the G-est in the G is.    

374
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,349
       It's Lord Hater,         
    number one superstar.       

375
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,751
   You want a piece of me,      
      Emperor Dork-some?        

376
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,686
     Got beef, Sandwich?        

377
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,922
      Then bring it on,         
           losers.              

378
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,924
     I will lightning you       
           so hard              

379
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,125
 that you'll be all, like...    

380
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,693
 Oh, sir.                       

381
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,495
 Excuse me.                     

382
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,665
    How dare you interrupt      
      my righteous rant         

383
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,867
       to the galaxy?!          

384
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,969
I'm sorry, sir.                 
It's just that,                 
you see,                        

385
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,772
     when I said the show       
      went out all over,        

386
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,307
       I meant all over         
       the skull ship.          

387
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,609
     ( nervous laughter )       
       Not the galaxy.          

388
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,712
    Wait. So who actually       
        watches this?           

389
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,682
Well, I don't have              
the exact figures handy.        

390
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,552
It certainly has                
the potential to be             
viewed by,                      

391
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:50,321
you know, anyone                
on the ship,                    

392
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,323
so mostly Watchdogs,            
I think.                        

393
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,126
          Watchdogs? You make   
          a show for Watchdogs? 

394
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,828
    That's the stupidest,       
      lamest thing ever!        

395
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,297
          I mean, really?       

396
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,365
     This show is stupid.       
        You're stupid.          

397
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,267
You should both be cancelled.   
          Hater out.            

398
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,885
     Sector G, hall one,        
          all clear.            

399
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,854

          all clear.

00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:28,059
    Sector G, hall three,       
          all clear.            

401
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,562
       Commander Peepers.       

402
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,497
     I promise I stopped        
    doing my stupid show.       
     Nothing is going on.

   Well, you mean, I didn't     
   need a Hater interview?      

410
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,552
    I was making the show       
the Watchdogs wanted all along? 

411
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:57,121
    A show that made them

   <i> Eye On the Skull Ship,</i>      

416

 the only show for Watchdogs,   
       about Watchdogs,         

417

        for Watchdogs,          

418
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:26,384
    I am your humble host,      
      Andy the Watchdog,        

419
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,119
  and today, I am here with     
          Giuseppe,             

420
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,787
       the ship's tailor.       

421
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,555
 So what's your secret?         

422
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:34,058
       You see, the Watchdogs   
       have the very big heads, 

423
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,826
         and the very           
        skinny necks.           

424
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,962
           So it's all about    
           the stretchy shirts. 

425
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,797
 Then it's about the beanies    
and the booties and the glovies.

       <i> - Fascinating.</i>          

428
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:47,104
         Yuck! Why would anyone 
         watch this?            

429
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,807
I don't know, sir.              
I just don't know.
