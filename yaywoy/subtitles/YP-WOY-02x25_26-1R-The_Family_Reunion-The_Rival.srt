You snuck onto                  
Dominator's ship to--           

13
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,343
    Discover her breakfast      
     beverage of choice.        

14
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,578
    Coffee gal. Would've pegged 
          her for a tea person. 

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,247
Now she's gonna                 
peg us.                         

16
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,549
 Oh, that's it!                 

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,386
     I am sick and tired        
        of Dominator!           

18
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,762
     Sick and tired of running, 
              of being blasted, 

19
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,098
   and I am sick and tired      
       of this galaxy.          

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,833
      This is too hard.         

21
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,103
      I... need... a...         

22
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,172
           break!!              

23
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:26,752
   Sorry, pal, but we have      
    gotta get outta here.       

24
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,389
 No, Sylvia, we've gotta get    
Dominator and Hater together.   

25
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,791
      There is literally        
    nothing in the galaxy       

26
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,028
   that could stop me from      
  uniting those two in love.    

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,830
You wanna                       
meet my family?                 

28
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,803
     Sylvia's home world,       
        here we come!           

29
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,549
     Sylvia, did you play       
       on this street?          

30
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,651
     Sylvia, did you eat        
        in that diner?          

31
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,321
Sylvia, do you know that guy?   
   What about her, or him?      

32
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,890
  Just because I'm from here    
doesn't mean I know everybody.  

33
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:08,594
         - Hey, Joe.            
       - Whassup, Syl?          
      Long time no see.         

34
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:12,831
          ( sighs )             
   Hey, house. Glad to see      
     you haven't changed.       

35
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,134
     Man, Ma's gonna flip       
      when she sees me.         

36
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,738
        Wander, she's not gonna 
                flip that much. 

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,073
              Put that hug away.

38
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,910
  But I've got room in here     
    for your whole family.      

39
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,645
                   No!          

40
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,481
                   Perfect.     

41
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,752
        - I'll get it.          
        - No, I will!           

42
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,322
       ( voices arguing )       

43
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,258
    SYLVIA: Uh, hey, Bill,      
          Phil, Gil.            

44
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,659
                ALL: Syl!       

45
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,365
SYLVIA: Glad to see you, too,   
     you narfin' froods.        

46
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,433
      MOTHER: Language.         

47
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,171
             Ma!                

48
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,672
        Oh, hey, Sylvia.        

49
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,041
Good to see ya.                 
Take the groceries, huh?        

50
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,445
 She seems... nice.             

51
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,680
            Oh, she'll be fine. 

52
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,649
     She's probably just        
        a little sore           

53
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:07,319
because I kinda sorta left home 
   without telling anybody.     

54
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,620
         You did what?!         

55
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,722
              Oh, she's a tough 
                     old broad. 

56
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,324
           She'll bust my chops 
                     for a bit, 

57
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,326
            and then everything 
         will be right as rain. 

58
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,195
                  ( groans )    

59
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,873
    Now that that's done,       

60
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,876
    time for a little rest      
       and reclination.         

61
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,745
                ( sighs )       

62
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,748
<i>Lord Dominator has taken down</i>   
<i>yet another planetary system--</i>  

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,617
    Ugh! What else is on?       

64
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,353
                 Whew!          

65
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,388
       ( snorts angrily )       

66
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,525
Syl, dinner isn't gonna         
cook itself.                    

67
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,493
         I can help.            

68
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,563
No, you're our guest.           

69
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,765
Sylvia!                         

70
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,672
So, you guys must have all kinds
of wacky stories about Sylvia.  

71
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:04,343
Sylvia, quiet that monkey down. 
I'm trying to watch this, uh... 
colors show.                    

72
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,845
      Oh, I'm no monkey.        
     Folks call we Wan--        

73
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,380
             He's not a monkey. 
                    He's a cat. 

74
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,415
      So let me ask you         
 something there, monkey-cat.   

75
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,117
       How much you bench?      

76
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,785
Oh, please, when have           
you seen a cat?                 

77
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,022
            Uh, just last week, 
                I saw two cats. 

78
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,758
      Two cats, he says.        
        Uh, this guy.           

79
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,927
       ( all arguing )          

80
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,435
So, Gram, you must have         
some stories about Sylvia.      

81
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,971
              I don't like you. 

82
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,840
Peel these.                     

83
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,877
         - And those.           
           - Grop!              

84
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,279
         - Language.            
           - Sorry.             

85
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,947
                Do you have a...

86
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,516
                peeler?         

87
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,819
   So, Ma, things seem like     
          they're...            

88
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,122
( blender whirs )               

89
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,324
                    I like what 
             you've done with-- 

90
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,925
( blender whirs )               

91
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,927
           It's...              
     - ( blender whirs )        

92
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,796
         - just so...           
     - ( blender whirs )        

93
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,799
      - nice to be home.        
     - ( blender whirs )        

94
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,803
       - What was that?         
          - Nothin'.            

95
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,139
Good. When you're done,         
you can start on the carrots.   

96
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,882
    Um, is there a salad?       

97
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,953
                     I'm sorry. 
                        A what? 

98
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,689
It's all right, Ma.             

99
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,992
He means, like,                 
bananas and nuts.               
Stuff monkeys eat.              

100
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,695
     You sure you wouldn't like 
       a nice saucer of milk... 

101
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,897
             kitty?             

102
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,873
Here you go,                    
buddy.                          

103
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,376
Syl, you remember               
the butter?                     

104
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,680
  So, cat-monkey, how do you    
and my sister know each other?  

105
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,849
   Actually, Sylvia's been      
    helping me help folks       

106
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,285
      all over the galaxy.      

107
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,020
    Oh, yeah. What do you       
      get paid to help?         

108
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:59,057
Just the warm satisfaction of   
knowing our friends are happy.  

109
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,727
    Huh. So nothin' then.       
      Where do you live?        

110
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,796
       We live wherever         
      the stars take us.        

111
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,732
      They're space hobos.      

112
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,901
   No, look, we help people     
by trying to thwart villains--  

113
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,137
Fat-free.                       
Cholesterol.                    

114
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,675
          Seriously?            
    You beat up bad guys?       

115
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,044
      Oh, gracious, no.         
     I don't hit anyone.        

116
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,680
       I prefer to use          
      the power of love.        

117
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,483
 Besides, there's no stronger   
   muscle than your heart.      

118
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,884
     Dirty space hippie.        

119
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,253
   You tellin' me you never     
         hit no one?            

120
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,988
                Cats don't hit, 
                  they scratch. 

121
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,990
So do monkeys.                  
They'll scratch                 
your eyes out.                  

122
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,558
              He's not a monkey!

123
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,894
   ( thrashing and crashing )   

124
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,606
     All right. Finally.        

125
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,574
           I am...              

126
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,079
         May I please           
         be excused?            

127
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,781
Okay.                           

128
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,251
After you clean                 
the dining room.                

129
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,822
      ( anguished shriek )      

130
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,958
      I'm sick and tired        
           of Mom.              

131
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,863
          So... how's it going? 

132
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,865
I'm sick and tired              
of working,                     

133
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,801
I'm sick of being               
bossed around,                  

134
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,202
and I'm sick and tired          
of this house!                  

135
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,137
This is too hard.               
Like I said,                    

136
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,206
I need a break.                 

137
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,008
              Sorry, pal, we've 
          gotta get outta here. 

138
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,081
        Oh, so you're           
        leavin' again.          

139
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,950
 Ma, don't start.               

140
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,652
                  Oh, it's fine.

141
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,987
               Things are maybe 
             a little too tough 
                  for you here. 

142
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,989
I feel like things are getting  
    to that yelling place       

143
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,992
      where I get thrown        
against the table again, so...  

144
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,728
Well, maybe if you were         
a little easier on me,          

145
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,132
like you are with               
my stupid stay-at-home          
brothers.                       

146
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,134
 - Are you callin' me stupid?   
    - Yeah, you're stupid!      

147
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,970
       ( all arguing )          

148
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,141
         Flabdrassit,           
        that's enough!          

149
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,175
                      Language. 

150
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:01,079
      Everyone, TV room,        
            <i> now!</i>               

151
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,585
    This is a talking stick.    

152
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:10,088
   Only the person holding      
 the talking stick can talk.    

153
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,159
      Now, Miss Dorothy,        
        you go first.           

154
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,994
                 "I feel..."    

155
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,630
I feel like an idiot            
holding this stick.             

156
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,699
            But how do you feel 
                  about Sylvia? 

157
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,170
She'd also look like            
an idiot holding this stick.    

158
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,006
       See? That's what         
       she always does.         

159
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,042
      You can only speak        
when you're holding the stick!  

160
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,111
         Any questions?         

161
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,614
    - Do you like bananas?      
       - Or tuna fish?          

162
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,382
I've been meanin' to ask you,   

163
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,217
     how much did you say       
        you can bench?          

164
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,154
     Did anyone else see        
the cat-monkey eyeing my pearls?

165
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,590
                He's not eyeing 
             your pearls, Gram. 

166
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,730
                    No, no, no! 

167
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,802
No, this is not promoting       
positive family values.         

168
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,671
             Stop!!             

169
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:04,009
     Ma, I'm sorry you're       
  mad at me because I left.     

170
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,878
    ( laughs ) I'm not mad      
          you left.             

171
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,147
       I'm mad because          
        you came back.          

172
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,817
             Huh?               
       Ow, ow, ow, ow!          

173
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,341
           DOROTHY:             
   I'm wicked proud of you.     

174
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,281
      Your pop would've         
          been, too.            

175
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,959
  You... you kept all this?     

176
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,727
        Of course I did.        

177
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,930
  You harass that Hater jerk    
      something fierce.         

178
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,966
       Now that there's         
        a bigger jerk           

179
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,468
trying to conquer the galaxy,   
      you're givin' up?         

180
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,771
   That's not my fearless,      
         gutsy girl.            

181
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,708
  So you either go out there    
   and deal with Dominator,     

182
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,410
        or stay here            
    and deal with Dorothy.      

183
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:16,314
       But either way,          
   it's not gonna be easy.      

184
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,625
   Okay, Ma, I'll take care     
        of the galaxy.          

185
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,862
     Then I'll take care        
        of the dishes.          

186
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,335
I can't take                    
this anymore!                   

187
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,605
         I love you,            
       Sylvia's family!         

188
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,307
     BILL: Oh, so that's        
     how much you bench.        

189
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,877
      GRAM: I think he's        
      going for my purse        

190
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,383
     HATER: Okay, there's       
      Dominator's ship.         

191
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,185
    What do I say to her?       

192
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,021
     "Hey, baby, are you        
 10,000 tons of molten lava,    

193
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,556
    'cause you're melting       
          my heart."            

194
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,291
    Oh, yeah, that's good.      
    Okay, here she comes.       

195
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,360
        You're totally          
      cool and awesome.         

196
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,128
   You're awesome, awesome,     
     you're... ( gasps )        

197
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,598
          Awesome?!             

198
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,536
            Peepers!            

199
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,040
  PEEPERS: Emperor Awesome?     
    What's he doing there?      

200
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,642
            That's what I said. 

201
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,343
 Okay, stay calm.               

202
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,212
Lots of people have             
white-striped space limos.      

203
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,647
 It might not be him.           

204
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,415
      Oh, you're right, Peepers.

205
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,217
      It could belong to anyone.

206
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,352
     Hey, babe, it's me,        
       Emperor Awesome.         

207
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,088
         Can I come in?         

208
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,329
        ( screaming )           

209
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,702
   This is the worst thing      
    that's ever happened.       

210
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,604
This doesn't                    
make sense.                     

211
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,273
            Why would Dominator 
            let Emperor Awesome 
                   on her ship? 

212
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,509
        He hasn't been          
     a contender in ages.       

213
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,944
     Unless... ( gasps )        

214
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,346
      He's got some kind        
    of new secret weapon.       

215
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,582
       What's the point         
 in trying anymore, Peepers?    

216
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,218
  I might as well just spend    
     the rest of my days        

217
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,386
     aimlessly wandering        
         the galaxy,            

218
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,089
        singing songs

00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,001
     It must be Awesome's       
        secret weapon.          

327
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,203
       We can't let it          
       reach Dominator.         

328
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,906
Gotta play this cool            
so as not to rouse suspicion.   

329

                  fist fighter. 

330

333
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,798
            What?               

334
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,034
      Whoa, whoa, whoa!

      Emperor Awesome's

             top secret weapon, 

341
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,976

                    the galaxy, 

342
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,944
         and your heart.        

343
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,646
       PEEPERS: Oh, no,         
     we were both right.        

344
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,781
     They are taking over       
     the galaxy together.       

345
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,518
And they are dating.            
Peepers, what do we do?         

346
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,358
           Hey, babe,           

347
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,660
         heard you were looking 
           for a secret weapon. 

348
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,530
                Well, check out 
                    these guns! 

349
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,500
No! That's so cool!

00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,770
           Karate.              

351
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,675
       <i> Let's get awesome!</i>      

352
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,377
       As you can see,          

353
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,113
    I've set them to stun.      
             Huh?               

354
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,950
Wow. Oh, and I thought          
you were all talk.              

355
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,885
I didn't think you'd            
actually try anything.          

356
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,787
 I'm impressed.                 

357
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,822
       Oh, thank grop,          
       you were right.          

358
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,958
           They're just dating. 
      There's no secret weapon. 

359
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,960
                  What a relief.

360
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,230
Now they're gonna smooch,       
get married, and have babies,   

361
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:03,234
and I'm gonna be                
alone forever.                  

362
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,836
   Oh, you're not alone, sir.   

363
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,139
         You have me            
      and the Watchdogs.        

364
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,575
     Who needs Dominator        
           anyway?              

365
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,377
               If she can't see 
             that you're really 
    the greatest in the galaxy, 

366
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,713
               then she doesn't 
                   deserve you. 

367
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,749
     - Really? You think?       
         - Of course.           

368
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,553
         Besides, I don't think 
               there's gonna be 
           any smooching. Look. 

369
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,422
You know,                       
when you showed up,             

370
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,757
I was, like, right,             
like I'm letting                
that scrub on my ship.          

371
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,726
But it was a slow day,          
no big planets to dominate,     

372
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,761
nothing but reruns on,          
so I figured, maybe             
he does have                    

373
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,930
some kind of                    
secret super weapon.            

374
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,932
At least it would               
be entertaining.                

375
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,334
 But you know what?             

376
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,536
I never guessed                 
what a pathetic                 

377
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,371
waste of time                   
you'd be.                       

378
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,707
     Do you really think        
I'd let you ride my coattails   

379
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,841
       to the top? Ha!          

380

Get real, buster!               

381
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,945
Not even that idiot Hater       
is as delusional as you.        

382

       She knows my name!       

383

                      an idiot. 

384
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,284

       name she knows.          

385
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,019
  Don't be like that, babe.     

386
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,221
