          She did it.           

19
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,661
     Dominator destroyed

20
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,396

          They lost!            
          I did it!             

28
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,250
 I played this stupid galaxy    
        like a fiddle,          

29
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,920
 and then smashed that fiddle   
across their dumb little faces. 

30
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,655
              Ha!               

31
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,626
       Come on, is this         
    a party or a funeral?       

32
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,795
   Well, I guess it's kind      
    of a funeral for them.      

33
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,298
     Still, show a little

36
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,643
    But I'm not gonna let       
     you sad-sack robozos       

37
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,045
       rain on my parade,       

38
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,648
    because I came, I saw,      
       and I dominated!         

39
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,052

        No more dopey           
  little planets to destroy.    

42
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,761
       No more annoying         
adorable idiots to antagonize.  

43
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,998
         It's... over.

00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,143
        It will all be          
          all right.            

47

48

00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,156
     Aw, it's not the same.

   What I wouldn't give for     
 one more planet to destroy.

          Welcome to our little 
               secret hideaway. 

54
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,708
        Can we get you anything?

55
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,710
     Vengeance!                 

56
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,446
Dominator destroyed my planet.  
My people have fled the galaxy. 

57
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,550
I want to know exactly what you 
heroes intend to do about it!   

58
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,185
                      Cheer up, 
              Your Bingle-ness. 

59
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,120
              We've got some of 
         the smartest, bravest, 

60
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,155
     and overall best-est       
     folks in the galaxy        

61
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,957
             here to figure out 
               how to stop her. 

62
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,525
           SYLVIA:              
      Everybody, hello.         

63
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,726
           Ooh, we're starting. 
         Better find our seats. 

64
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,663
       Hello, everyone.         
         I'm Sylvia.            

65
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,965
        Whoo! Sylvia!           
          All right!            

66
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,501
    We've invited you here      
        because, well,          

67
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:23,902
     there's no place else.     

68
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,837
   Dominator has driven us      
        from our homes          

69
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,473
    and kept us on the run      
   for an entire season...      

70
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,676
         of our lives.          

71
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,344
    Well, I'm done running.     

72
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,745
      I'm making a stand        
      on this tiny rock         

73
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,581
     so small and far away      

74
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,583
     that even Dominator        
  can't find it, here at...     

75
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,656
           I feel like that was 
        a poor choice of words. 

76
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,725
      This is our galaxy.       

77
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,660
      And no hot-headed,        
     cold-hearted psycho        

78
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,229
       is gonna take it         
           from us.             

79
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,497
        ( all cheering )        

80
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,335
           Um, yeah.            

81
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,669
   What's your plan exactly?    

82
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,406
   I am open to suggestions.    

83
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,576
      We should consult         
 the mighty wizard Neckbeard    

84
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,712
   the all-knowing nay-sayer.   

85
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,513
      Yeah, tried that.         
         Didn't work.           

86
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,881
      Could've told 'em         
         it wouldn't.           

87
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,417
       Legend tells of          
    an ancient battle mech      

88
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,786
  known as Robomechabotatron.   

89
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:18,357
     Yeah, we kinda sorta       
        blew that up.           

90
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,426
     ( chanting ominously       
          in Latin )            

91
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,099
        Whoa! That is...        

92
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,768
        That is dark.           
 Yeah, we're not doin' that.    

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,137
      Why don't we just         
      cozy up down here         

94
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,240
  until this Dominator bird     
gets bored and hits the bricks? 

95
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:38,443
And let her do the same thing   
      to another galaxy?        

96
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,580
    No way. This stops now.     

97
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,048
        Major Threat,           
        you used to be          

98
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,750
       one of the worst         
       villains around.         

99
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,151
    A true galactic terror.     

100
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,552
       What should we do?       

101
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,588
       I don't know, man.       

102
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,125
     All this heavy stuff       
  is really bumming me out.     

103
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,494
    Hey, who's up for pizza?    

104
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,629
               I want anchovies!

105
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,931
      - Half pineapple.         
       - No pineapple.          

106
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,901
       ( all clamoring )        

107
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:06,405
 No wonder Dominator was able   
  to take over this galaxy.     

108
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,440
          Lord Hater?           

109
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,975
             Barry!             

110
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,576
             Andy!              

111
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,413
            Anybody!            

112
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,482
     Listen up, Watchdogs.      

113
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,484
   To the untrained eyeball,    

114
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,087
    it may seem as though       
      Dominator has won.        

115
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,989
             Wrong!             

116
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,524
         I have done            
      careful research,         

117
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,659
    and using my extensive      
          knowledge             

118
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,161
       of gravity wells         
    and thermodynamics...       

119
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,663
       - His what now?          
  - I have uncovered this--     

120
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,332
      a class D planetoid       

121
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,600
      emitting a minimal        
     gravitational pull,        

122
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,470
      allowing it to go         
   undetected by Dominator,     

123
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,539
         which means...         

124
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,608
    there's one planet left.    

125
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,847
         - There is?            
   - And guess who's on it.     

126
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,318
           Oh, great.           

127
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,455
      We will use Wander        
       as a distraction         

128
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,857
     in order to conquer        
         the planet,            

129
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,828
turning our greatest weakness   
 into our greatest strength!    

130
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,797
          - We will?            
- Dominator may have destroyed  

131
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,700
     every other planet,        
   but as long as there is      

132
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,136
      hate in my bones,         
 she will never get this one!   

133
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,972
        This is where           
      we make our stand,        

134
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,707
       and let her know         
       that she failed          

135
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,644
     because this planet,       
      nay, this galaxy,         

136
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,147
          belongs to            
   the Duke of Destruction,     

137
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,882
     the Monarch of Mayhem,     

138
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,985
         the greatest           
        in the galaxy,          

139
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,388
          Lord Hater!           

140
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,889
  Hate's great. Best villain.   

141
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,190
        Hate's great.           
        Best villain.           

142
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,825
      Watchdogs, eyes up.       

143
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,927
  We've got a galaxy to save.   

144
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,263
  so we can conquer it later!   

145
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,599
      Where has this guy        
      been all season...        

146
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,535
         of our lives?          

147
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,504
  Hate's great. Best villain.   

148
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,539
        Hate's great.           
        Best villain.           

149
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,243
        ( all arguing )         

150
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,514
          Hello. Ahem.          

151
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,048
        Yoo-hoo, hey.           
          Over here.            

152
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,584
       Hi. ( giggles )          
        Hi, everybody.          

153
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,052
    I know you're all upset,    

154
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,687
      but taking it out         
        on each other           

155
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,122
      won't help anything.      

156
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,426
    Sure, Dominator's cut       
   a brutal swath of chaos      

157
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,394
       and destruction          
    throughout our galaxy,      

158
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:12,230
      but if she gets us        
   to turn on our friends,      

159
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,099
    then we've really lost.     

160
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,635
   A planet's just a place      
      you hang your hat.        

161
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,270
          As long as            
    we've got each other,       

162
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,305
    we've still got a shot.     

163
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,274
          ( cheering )          

164
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,877
  Together, there's nothing     
  in the galaxy we can't do!    

165
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,479
           ALL: Yeah!           

166
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,915
   So, what are we gonna do?    

167
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,083
    ALL: Destroy Dominator!     

168
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,986
     - Yeah... what now?        
     - Destroy Dominator!       

169
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,155
       Whoa, whoa, whoa!        

170
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,557
      Resheath that sword.      

171
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,158
       Undraw those guns.       

172
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,327
              Deflex those pecs.

173
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,728
          I don't wanna destroy 
                       anybody. 

174
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,564
       Sylvia, help me out here.

175
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,599
                         Sylvia?

176
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,767
 I... I'm sorry, buddy.         

177
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,569
    But I thought we were       
       gonna figure out         

178
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,571
       how to stop her          
     from being so evil.        

179
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:55,607
  There's gotta be a reason     
        she's so mean.          

180
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,409
       If we could just         
       figure that out.         

181
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,445
       An enemy's just a friend 
          you haven't made yet. 

182
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,646
                   Right?       

183
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,153
      Sometimes an enemy        
      is just an enemy.         

184
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,989
      Thanks, but we'll         
     handle it from here.       

185
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,524
   Okay, Starbella, Ripov,      
        Major Threat,           

186
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:13,625
     you've all got ships.      

187
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,427
 The Baa'haalans have an army.  

188
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,195
Neckbeard's got tons of magical 
      weapons and stuff.        

189
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,297
      It's a bold move,         
  but someone's gotta do it.    

190
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,234
       ( all chattering )       

191
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,139
         Dumb. Stupid.          

192
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,643
         Sigh. Boring!          

193
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,812
     Suggested course of action:

194
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,548
        Dominate another galaxy.

195
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,784
But that means                  
starting from scratch.          

196
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,553
Meeting a bunch                 
of new people,                  

197
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,723
figuring out the right way      
to crush their spirits.         

198
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,159
      ( frustrated groan )      

199
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,830
   Demolishing this galaxy      
     was my masterpiece.        

200
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:55,333
   It was so full of dorks      
   ripe for the dominating.     

201
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,869
    Where am I gonna find       
        anyone as dumb          

202
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,573
         and hopeful            
     and pathetic and...        

203
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,017
  ( deep, distorted voice )     
           Perfect.             

204
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,653
       ( evil laughter )        

205
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,561
         WANDER: Hello.         

206
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,929
           Dominator?           

207
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,697
     I wanted to stop by,       
         have a chat,           

208
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,432
        Is this a bad...        

209
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,968
            ...time?            

210
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,675
          DOMINATOR:            
      Bots, stand down.         

211
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,083
      - You're not gonna        
    have them destroy me?       
            - No.               

212
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,620
       Ah, see? I knew          
     you weren't all bad.       

213
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,122
       I'm going to destroy you.

214
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,792
            - Run.              
     - What the what now?       

215
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,594
         ( screaming )          

216
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,702
  Pete, man the torpedo tubes.  

217
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,470
  Ted, prepare Eye Fighters     
         for launch.            

218
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,472
         Captain Tim,           
          heel, sit.            

219
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,374
                    Good boy.   

220
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,479
          Sir, you're on point, 
             you're formulating 
                    strategies. 

221
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,648
              You actually know 
          the Watchdogs' names. 

222
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,050
        This is incredible!     

223
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,620
         No, Peepers.           
     This is incredible.        

224
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,122
           Activate             
     skull crusher mode.        

225
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:32,330
         ♪ Here comes           
     the skull crusher ♪        

226
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,003
           - Whoa!              
      - Peepers, no time        
       for distraction.         

227
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,238
     We need to focus on        
   getting our galaxy back.     

228
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,606
        Are you crying?         

229
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,808
          ( crying )            
           No, sir.

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,211
        Barry, Jerry,           
          punch it!             

231
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,651
         ( laughing )           
     Hey, get back here.        

232
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,120
       What fun is you          
      running in terror         

233
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,657
   if I don't get to watch      
      you run in terror?        

234
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,526
     I just wanna get to        
    the root of your pain.      

235
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,628
      Maybe hug it out.         
             Ow!                

236
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,164
          ( laughing )          

237
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,532
    Sylvia, oh, thank Grop.     

238
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,768
         We gotta get           
     outta here before...       

239
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,102
            Sylvia!             

240
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,837
            Noooooo!            

241
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,677
      ( Dominator laughs )      

242
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,478
         The look...            
         ( laughing )           

243
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,780
                   on your face.

244
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,115
                   "Sylvia, no!"

245
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:28,653
         Thought your friend... 
             dead. ( laughing ) 

246
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,455
 Why are you like this?         

247
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,558
      Ha ha. Just lucky,        
           I guess.             

248
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,527
   I'm serious.                 

249
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,495
Everyone else is out there      
trying to destroy you.          

250
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,632
But I figure there's good       
<i>way deep down </i> in everyone.     

251
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,034
There's gotta be                
some reason you're              

252
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,502
so Grop darned                  
evil all the time.              

253
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,038
If you just tell me             
what's ailin' ya,               

254
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,907
maybe I can help you out.       

255
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,709
What do ya say?                 

256
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,811
           Really?              
         You mean it?           

257
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,646
Of course I do,                 

258
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:57,649
because I believe an enemy      
is just a friend                

259
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,317
you haven't made yet.           

260
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,320
                   Wow. I gotta 
                      thank you 

261
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,889
            for letting me know 
     there's more of you idiots 

262
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,491
           out there to destroy.

263
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,359
    What? No!                   

264
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,062
         You said everyone else 
      was trying to destroy me. 

265
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,164
             That means they're 
               still out there. 

266
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,433
 Where are they?                

267
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,669
       They're nowhere.         
       I mean, there's          
       no one anywhere.         

268
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,337
             Even if there was, 
                  it's not like 

269
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,072
    they're secretly hiding out 
      and plotting your demise. 

270
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,241
       It's just little old me, 
         so you better hurry up 

271
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,076
             and destroy me now 
             please. Thank you. 

272
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,778
Bots, scan him.                 

273
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,050
     Shut up!                   

274
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,518
There's another planet          
to dominate?                    

275
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,589
And it's full of                
your weird little pals?         

276
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,591
       Oh, this is just         
      the cherry on top         

277
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,259
       I was looking for.       

278
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,762
      But I just wanted         
         to help you.           

279
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,064
    Oh, you were a big help.    

280
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,866
            Friend.             

281
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,646
        Okay, rebels,           
    what are we gonna do?       

282
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,381
    ALL: Destroy Dominator.     

283
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,716
    How are we gonna do it?     

284
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,318
       Destroy Dominator!       

285
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,487
          Sorry.                

286
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,089
     Yeah. Yeah, no, I get that.

287
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,558
           Love the enthusiasm. 
       But how? We need a plan. 

288
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,361
      We can't waltz up         
and punch her ship, you know?   

289
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,565
  Wander, you've snuck onto     
  her ship more than anyone.    

290
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,400
         Do you have            
      any bright ideas?         

291
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,968

293
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,906
       There's no place         
 left in the galaxy except...   

294
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,140
            Oh, no.             

295
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,080
          Hey, guys,            
       how's it going?          

296
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,482
       Guess who I found.       

297
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,851
       - Wanna say hi?          
            - Hi.               

298
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,487
    Wander. Oh, thank Grop      
      you're still okay.        

299
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,955
       I was so worried         
          about you.            

300
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,523
I was worried                   
you'd be worried.               

301
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,293
   Well, I was worried that     
  my worry would worry you.     

302
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,694
I was worried--                 

303
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,129
      Enough! You should        
       all be worried.

306
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,303
        It is you who           
      should be worried,        

307

308
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,873
            - Huh?              
           - Hatey!             

309
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,875
   You can steal my planets,    

310
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,010
       you can capture

311
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,646
         you can even           
      break up with me.         

312
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,682

      through me first!         

315
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,468
         Well, that was weird.  

316

00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,042
          That's it.            
        This ends now.          

344
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,683
        I'm doing it.           
    I'm actually winning.       

345
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,353
We're all                       
very impressed.                 

346
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,588
  What exactly do you think     
    is gonna happen here?       

347
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,591
    Um, I'm gonna stop you.     

348
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,493
Ha! Please.                     

349
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,162
Even if you could,              
you'd still be a joke.          

350
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,268
The lamest                      
in the galaxy.                  

351
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,704
                  Just a dopey, 
             soft-centered jerk 

352
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:50,541
    that nobody has ever,       
    or will ever, respect.      

353
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,282
                       Face it. 
              You are literally 

354
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:03,254
                      the worst 
                  villain ever! 

355
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,129
        Hate's great.           
        Best villain.           

356
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,398
                  Hate's great. 
                  Best villain. 

357
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,500
      ALL: Hate's great.        
        Best villain.           

358
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,301
        Hate's great.           
        Best villain.           

359
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,903
  Hate's great. Best villain.   

360
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,705
        Hate's great.           
        Best villain.           

361
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,507
  Hate's great. Best villain.   

362
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,342
        Hate's great.           
        Best villain.           

363
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,411
  Hate's great. Best villain.   

364
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,623
       ( alarm blaring )        

365
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,527
     How is this happening?     

366
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,562
     They're just a bunch       
       of goofy idiots.         

367
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,164
         Bots, help me!         

368
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,037
   Fine. I don't need you.      
    I don't need anybody.       

369
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,506
        That's silly.           
  Everybody needs somebody.     

370
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,542
          ( gasps )             
          That's it.            

371
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,444
          You need us.          

372
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:00,845
 I have Sylvia,                 

373
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,513
Lord Hater has                  
Peepers and the Watchdogs.      

374
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,415
But you're all alone            
up here.                        

375
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,185
        Shut up. I got          
       lots of friends.         

376
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,421
       Bot 79, Bot 108,         
           Bot 13.              

377
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,423
     No, wait, I blew up        
           Bot 13.              

378
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,725
           Shut up!             
  I've got lots of friends!     

379
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,961
You could've destroyed us       
when you first showed up.       

380
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,796
When we put on                  
that concert for you,           

381
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,932
heck, you spent a whole night   
        out with Syl.           

382
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:25,570
But you didn't                  
because you like                
hanging around us.              

383
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,738
Even if it is in                
a "Rrrr, grr, I'm               
gonna kill you" way.            

384
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,541
                       Stop it. 
             Just stop talking. 

385
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,577
      That's why you're         
        such a bully.           

386
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,611
         You're lonely.         

387
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,081
          ( growling )          

388
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,951
       I'll destroy you!        

389
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:09,213
          ( cheering )          

390
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,672
            Wander!             

391
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,509
        ( all cheering )        

392
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,646
              Wh... what?       

393
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,714
            Why did you save me?

394
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,484
           I tried to kill you, 
                   like, a lot. 

395
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,854
Because an enemy's              
just a friend you               
haven't made yet.               

396
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,190
And there's a whole bunch       
of potential friends down there.

397
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,325
Sure, you sorta tried           
to destroy 'em,                 

398
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,627
so there'll be a few            
awkward dinner parties,         

399
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,062
but if they can                 
cheer for him,                  

400
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,798
they can accept                 
anybody.                        

401
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,067
           You realize I, like, 
                     demolished 

402
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,670
             your entire galaxy.

403
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,506
You'd be surprised              
what you can grow               

404
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,676
from a little                   
bit of kindness.                

405
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,579
It's never too late             
for a fresh start.              

406
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,881
So, let's try this again.       

407
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,382
Hello to you.                   

408
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,684
Folks call me Wander.           

409
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,152
That's my pal Sylvia.           

410
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,587
 Welcome to the galaxy.         

411
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,922
We hope you'll accept           
our humble gift of friendship.  

412
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,334
            Shut up!            

413
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,604
        Ugh. You guys           
        are so weird.           
         I'm leaving.           

414
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,506
           Didn't wanna destroy 
              your goofy little 
                 galaxy anyway. 

415
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,842
             You're all a bunch 
                      of dorks! 

416
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,082
                I'm taking this 
             'cause I'm hungry, 

417
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,750
                     not 'cause 
                 we're friends. 

418
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,521
Buddy, I am so sorry            
I doubted you.                  

419
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,790
You were                        
totally right.                  

420
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,459
        I don't know about that.

421
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,461
       I really thought         
  I could make a new friend.    

422
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:06,697
I think you may                 
just yet.                       

423
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:10,067
  PEEPERS: You did it, sir.     
    You saved the galaxy!       

424
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,637
    A galaxy of new planets.    

425
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,338
            For me.             

426
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,243
          To conquer.           

427
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,512
    Starting with this one!     

428
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,124
            Or it's a whole new 
      galaxy for us to explore. 

429
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,558
               Come on, buddies.

430
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,628
         ( shrieks )            
   We're not your buddies!      

431
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,197
     PEEPERS AND SYLVIA:        
    Nothing ever changes.       

432
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,178
       Come on. Stupid          
      friendship orange.        

433
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,913
           Dumb peel.           

434
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,615
        Bunch of dorks.         

435
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,551
      They'll get what's        
       coming to them.          

436
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,056
      ( Hater's laughter        
          echoing )
