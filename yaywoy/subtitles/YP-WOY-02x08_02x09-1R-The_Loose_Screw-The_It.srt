it never hurts to help.

    SYLVIA: It's not just

   that needs a jump-start?     

67
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,175
Yeah. And though                
she says she doesn't,           

68
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,777

00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,924
      I don't even think        
       he has a house!          

232
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,427
Sir, if you want to make it back
onto the Top Ten,               

233
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,328
you have to stop viewing Wander 
         as a threat            

234
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,331
   and focus on actual villains 
       that are actual threats. 

235
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,666
   Like Dominator. Grrr!        

236
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,835
Let's start with                
General McGuffin.               

237
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,338
Now, our spies have located     
a weak spot in the force field  

238
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,841
around McGuffin's               
heavily fortified               
military stronghold.            

239
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,677
We sneak in, deactivate         
the force field, take his base, 

240
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,279
 and steal his territory.       

241
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,382
That'll pad our planetary       
numbers quite nicely.           

242
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,450
        Point me at him!        

243
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,285
        I'll deep-fry           
    the feathers off him!       

244
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,753
     Love that enthusiasm,      

245
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,355
    but this will be a delicate 
               covert operation 

246
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,357
  with lots of twists and turns.

247
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,859
I need your undivided attention.

248
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,596
                 Do I have your 
           undivided attention? 

249
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,264
          Absolutely.           

250
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,401
   Nothing will distract me     
from taking out these <i> losers</i>   

251
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,705
       and re-becoming          
 the greatest in the galaxy!    

252
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,741
      ( thunder crashes )       

253
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,644
Tag! You're It!                 

254
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,286
            Oh, no.             

255
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,324
       Commander Peepers.       

256
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:43,528
 I believe you were going to    
brief us on your invasion plan. 

257
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,698
 You--You're not gonna flip out 
           and chase after him? 

258
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,401
Please. Do you think            
I'm going to let some silly game

259
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:54,405
ruin my chances                 
at galactic superiority?        

260
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,375
              Uh, you <i> do </i> seem 
         to do that a lot, so-- 

261
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,278
      Of course not, sir.       

262
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,914
    Glad to see you've got      
   your eyes on the prize!      

263
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,417
 Now, General McGuffin's base   
has 32 separate sentry turrets  

264
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,454
     surveying 45 degree angles 
          in varying intervals. 

265
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,322
          After fording         
          the perimeter moat,   

266
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,891
          which is crawling     
          with water wingmen,   

267
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,593
we'll hit the infinity minefield
full of self-preparing mines.   

268
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,062
            I'm not gonna lie-- 
       not all of you are gonna 
 make it back through that one. 

269
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,464
    I'm lookin' at you, Pap.    

270
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,999
 The secondary moat is tricky.  

271
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,835
It's rigged with alarm sensors  
  that can tag our presence     

272
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,403
 and it alternates its pattern. 

273
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,338
      If you're tagged,         
       it is imperative         

274
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,907
     that you tag its it-it     

275
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,608
 while <i> it </i> tags the it-it tag. 

276
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,778
    It-it-tag-tag-it-tag-       
      it-it-tag-tag-it.         

277
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,713
       You all got that?        

278
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,383
    Great. 'Cause this is where 
                it gets tricky. 

279
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,051
      Because everything        
    we've just encountered      

280
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,353
      is actually a mass        
   hallucination induced by     

281
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,489
      General McGuffin's        
      psychic battalion.        

282
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,491
     We have to confront        
     our innermost fears        

283
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,426
   in order to defeat them,     
 awake from the dream state,    

284
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,795
and then start the whole thing  
  over again from Step One.     

285
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,565
 The conference table is base!  

286
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,736
        What was that?          
           Nothing!             
  Totally paying attention.     

287
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,973
Good. Now, once we've escaped   
to that alternate timeline...   

288
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,375
    ( Peepers continues )       
         Psst. Barry.           

289
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,910
Take your hand                  
off the table.                  

290
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,549
Oh, no! There's a big,          
scary monster under the <i> table!</i> 

291
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,484
And he's, like,                 
totally gonna eat you           

292
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,520
unless you run away             
from the <i> table!</i>                

293
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,455
 Run, Barry, run!               

294
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,425
 Barry! As your Supreme Leader, 

295
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,460
I'm warning you to take         
your hand off the table!        

296
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,463
  Grrr!                         

297
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,100
    ( electrical crackling )    

298
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,713
         No tag backs!          

299
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,414
           ( roars )            

300
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,722
    Which leads us to Step 47A, 
    subsection B, 4th appendix. 

301
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,491
         Now that we've cleared 
                the outer-inner 
         inner-outer perimeter, 

302
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,493
          we have to circumvent 
 the inner-inner-inner-outer... 

303
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,661
      LORD HATER: Okay,         
        who can I tag?          

304
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,163
        Who can I tag?          
     Who can I... Bingo.        

305
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,633
       ...posted at the turrets 
      each grew up in different 
                    time zones, 

306
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,034
             so their Circadian 
                  sleep rhythms 

307
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,435
        will be all out of sync.

308
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,437
                  Question, sir?

309
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,574
       Bathroom break!          
   I need a bathroom break.     

310
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,610
        ( all roaring )         

311
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,713
  LORD HATE: Get back here!     
          Slow down!            

312
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,448
        Okay, new plan.         

313
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,584
If we want to have any chance   
     of pulling this off,       

314
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,452
     one of you is gonna        
   have to let him tag you.     

315
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,555
       Uh, sir? Why don't <i> you </i> 
               let him tag you? 

316
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,560
(stammering) No!                
Of course, that wouldn't work   

317
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:33,731
because as his second in command
I can't be It because--         

318
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:34,933
         Ohh, fine!             

319
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,468
   You're all a bunch of babies!

320
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,937
     ( roaring, screaming )     

321
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,572
    Everybody get back here!    

322
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,777
     Sir, in the interest       
       of the invasion,         

323
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,112
         I have decided         
         to let you tag <i> me.</i>    

324
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,715
  Thanks, CPeeps.               
  Tag, you're--                 

325
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,618
                Oh! Sorry, sir, 
           I must have tripped. 

326
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,619
                Go ahead.       

327
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,889
           Peepers...           

328
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,724
                   I don't know 
           what's come over me. 

329
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,460
  I promise, sir, this time     
I will remain completely still. 

330
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,633
                         Aaaah! 
      Sir, I don't wanna be It! 

331
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,102
    Peepers, get back here!     

332
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,205
     ( Lord Hater roars,        
      Peepers screams )         

333
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,474
   Food court is a safe zone!   

334
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,543
     ( mellow music plays )     

335
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,813
                    ( slurps )  

336
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,082
       Safe zone expired!       

337
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,721
           WANDER:              
    The floor is hot lava!      

338
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,671
        ( swords clang )        

339
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,644
          ( chuckles )          

340
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:54,879
              Tag.              

341
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,751
      PEEPERS: Freeze tag.      

342
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,592
      ( muffled shouting )      

343
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,696
       Oh, no! You accidentally 
               froze Lord Hater 
                in Coldbrrnite! 

344
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,564
       Yes, accidentally.       

345
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,066
      And that's exactly        
     what we'll tell <i> him</i>       

346
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,634
      when we unfreeze him      

347
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,237
     after we break into        
 General McGuffin's fortress.   

348
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,042
            Finally!            

349
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,544
I have your undivided attention.

350
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,548
    So...let's talk about       
        your feelings.          

351
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,217
      ( muffled screams )       

352
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,886
        ( birds shriek )        

353
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,631
          ( beeping )           

354
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,705
       Have you ever considered 
             a healthier outlet 
           for your aggression? 

355
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,774
You could be a pastry chef!     

356
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,810
 Eww. No, I've tasted           
 your cooking.                  

357
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:02,080
Ooh! Or a professional luchador!

      ( muffled shouting )      

360
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,587
                  I don't think 
    I'm getting through to you. 

361
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,289

00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,309
      The force field generator.

374
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,812
  Disable that, and our army    
 can descend on the fortress    

375
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,714
   before General McGuffin      
    even knows we're here.      

376
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,182
       ( alarm wails )          
       What the-- How?!

     What in the Sam Hill       
     is goin' on in here?       

382
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,199

    PEEPERS: We did it, sir!

   We're back on the Top Ten!   

399
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,264
 ( band plays, crowd cheering ) 

400
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,867
         What? We did?          

401
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,003
Everyone is terrified           
of being It!                    

402
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,839
A true villain turns            
a weakness into a strength!     

403
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,174
We're going                     
all the way to the top!         

404
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,508
                  We are?       

405
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,745
         We are. Yeah!          

406
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,513
           High-five!           

407
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:54,018
          Nooooooo!!!           

408
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,920
         ( explosion )          

409
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,889
            I'm It?             

410
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,758
            I'm It!             

411
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,829
       I have the power!        

412
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,964
       ( crazy laughter )       

413
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,040
           (sighs) Okay, here's 
 the elaborate, multi-part plan 

414
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,209
                      to defeat 
        our <i> new </i> arch-nemesis, 

415
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:20,177
            Ted from Accounting.

416
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,380
        Got your nose!          
        Give it back!           

417
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,282
          Sir, you don't <i> have </i> 
                        a nose. 

418
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,284
   Yeah, because Wander         
   stole it!                    

419
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,085
    Get back here!              

420
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,954
                      ( crying )

421
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:36,127
        There, there.           
   It's not gonna be okay.      

422
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,563
 Now, General McGuffin's base   
has 32 separate sentry turrets  

423
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,400
     surveying 45 degree angles 
          in varying intervals. 

424
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,035
          After fording         
          the perimeter moat,   

425
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,536
          which is crawling     
          with water wingmen,   

426
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:48,339
we'll hit the infinity minefield
full of self-preparing mines.   

427
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,275
            I'm not gonna lie-- 
       not all of you are gonna 
 make it back through that one. 

428
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,576
    I'm lookin' at you, Pap.    

429
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,545
 This is where it gets tricky,  

430
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,047
      because everything        
    we've just encountered      

431
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,215
      is actually a mass        
   hallucination induced by     

432
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,251
      General McGuffin's        
      psychic battalion.        

433
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,019
     We have to confront        
     our innermost fears        

434
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,954
   in order to defeat them,     
 awake from the dream state,    

435
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,023
and then start the whole thing  
  over again from Step One.
