00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,060
                    Sorry, Syl.

00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,163
                     I was sure

                  What a shame.

00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:07,599

   - Yeah, sure. Whatever.      

27
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,437
      Now find something

      - Awesome, buddy.

Wait, what now?

           I knew he liked her.

for getting gushy.

00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,209

        what it says.           

40
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,810
        But I dare not          
           open it,             

41
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,912
        for it is not           
       addressed to me.         

42
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,615
        But I bet it's          
 an elegant and eloquent list   

43
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,818
of all of the things he finds   
  so fascinating about her.     

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,821
         Oh, yeah, like how she 
           heartlessly destroys 
        everything in her path. 

45
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,591

46
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,826

47
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,663

         on this sort of thing, 

109
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,888
              but since love is 
           compelling me toward 
                 another quest, 

110
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,757
          I'd just like to ask, 

111
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,759
            is this really what 
            you want to do with 
                     your life? 

112
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,327
   Uh, yeah, I don't know.      
        Probably not.           

113
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,763
    Seemed like a good idea.    

114
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,231
       So I don't know.         
          Maybe not.            

115
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,533
 'Cause... yeah, sorry.         

116
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:45,070
Thanks. Okay, bye.              
Sorry. Bye.                     

117
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,905
 Sorry.                         

118
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,173
      ( kazoo fanfare )         

119
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,047
Wander, look.                   

120
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,517
Let's go find                   
a scary ghost monster.          

121
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,086
            It'll just turn out 
          to be Old Man Jenkins 
                   in disguise. 

122
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,088
Search for lost                 
antiquities?                    

123
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,190
           We'll just end up in 
               a temple solving 
            a bunch of riddles, 

124
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,392
           dodging poison darts 
          and getting chased by 
               a giant boulder, 

125
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,960
               just to find out 
    that the greatest treasures 

126
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,062
                are friendship, 
         which we already knew. 

127
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,633
     Okay. Then how about       
     returning to places        
    we've already enjoyed?      

128
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:18,370
Old Shlooshy, the Museum of     
Giant Antiquities, Phunulon,    

129
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,640
Shatterton, Ballzeria X,        
the Statue of the               
Galactic Guru.                  

130
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,208
     Been there. Seen it.       
     Loved it. Loved it!        

131
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,010
                       Seen it. 
                    Been there. 

132
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,147
         Ye Olde Tiny           
     Candlestick Makers.        

133
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,855
            What?               

134
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,159
     That sounds like...        

135
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,799
And we're definitely            
going there after I             
get this letter to Dominator.   

136
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,501
      ( kazoo fanfare )         

137
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,809
                  Wander, look, 
                a missing sock. 

138
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,182
 Is that baby lost?             

139
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,722
       What's in the box?       

140
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,093
           Who cares?           

141
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,229
               I sure could use 
                  a cold drink. 

142
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,571
  Sylvia, you're not trying     
   to keep me from being...     

143
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,280
Oh, stop you                    
from being...                   

144
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,219
Me? Wander, how could           
you even...                     

145
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,188
 I am so surprised.             

146
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,323
No, I'm shocked.                
I'm shocked and hurt.           

147
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,193
       Yes, I'm deeply,         
   maybe irreparably hurt,      

148
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,161
     that you could think       
   that I could ever, ever      

149
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,265
 ever stand in the way of...    
            Grop.               

150
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,471
      Wander, sometimes         
 you come up with crazy ideas   

151
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,107
    that I would classify       
        as, well, bad.          

152
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,276
     But I only say that        
because you're my best friend,  

153
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,311
       and I'm worried          
       you'll get hurt.         

154
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,579
                  You see where 
               I'm comin' from? 

155
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,147
       I sure do, Sylvia.       

156
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,949
        But I have to           
      ask you something.        

157
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,484
        Do you trust me?        

158
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,486
          ( sighs )             

159
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,923
     Buddy, if you wanna        
     deliver that letter        
     to Dominator's ship,       

160
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,993
    well, I'll be with you      
    every step of the way.      

161
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,837
         Whoa. Whoa!            

162
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,973
Sylvia, are you nuts?           

163
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,142
We can't just go up             
to Dominator's bots.            
We'll get killed.               

164
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,316
       I was just gonna         
     put it in the mail.        

165
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,527
         - So now...            
  - I guess it's time for...    

166
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,778
       "Do you like me?         
          Check 1."             

167
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,049
      Who is this from?         

168
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,785
       All right, sir.          

169
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,520
          If we are             
       to have any hope         

170
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,655
         of stopping            
 Dominator's invasion force,    

171
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,558
   we need to use the most      
 powerful weapon of them all.   

172
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,061
   Please be giant lasers.      
   Please be giant lasers!      

173
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,296
        - Our brains.           
            - Doh!              

174
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,998
     I have recently been       
        experimenting           

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,335
   with the extremely rare,     
 extremely unstable isotope,    

176
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,005
         Frostonium 17.         

177
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,374
    If we expose Dominator      
   to a blast of Frostonium     

178
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,177
at close range, the subsequent  
  exothermic process will--     

179
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,511
           Boring!              

180
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,715
Boring?! Sir, this weapon will  
neutralize not only Dominator,  

181
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,550
         but her ship           
       and entire army.         

182
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,418
      Yeah, but will it         
         impress her?           

183
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,219
       Rock her world?          

184
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,922
    Get her lava flowing?       

185
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,690
   No! The exact opposite.      

186
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,659
           - What?!             
        - Just watch.           

187
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,396
 HATER: Oh, no. The powerful    
   and beautiful Dominator      

188
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,031
        has conquered           
       another planet.          

189
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:16,101
     ( falsetto ) Nobody        
   in the galaxy is strong      

190
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,869
       or hunky enough          
         to stop me.            

191
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,604
          Ha ha ha!             

192
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,706
       ( normal voice )         
   Guess again, Dominator.      

193
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,409
     Prepare to surrender       
      and swoon. It's...        

194
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,421
         ( falsetto )           
      That's so amazing,        

195
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,123
     and totally excellent!     

196
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,424
       ( normal voice )         
       The H.A.T.E.R.V.         

197
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,459
equipped with missile launcher, 
       punching fists,          

198
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,962
 grab-action claw, buzz-saws,   
       slime launcher,          

199
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:48,466
  laser beam, pizza shooter,    
          and more!!            

200
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,270
   Hey, babe, why don't you     
       come take a ride         

201
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,773
       on the Hater side?       

202
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,608
    ( falsetto swooning )       

203
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,942
      The H.A.T.E.R.V.,         

204
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,245
  coming soon to a galactic     
    battlefield near you.       

205
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,447
   Potential choking hazard     
 for Kremlons and Mikkelops.    

206
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,482
 I love you, Hater.             

207
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,750
           I know.              

208
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,485
           I can't...           

209
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,953
           I don't...           

210
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,089
  Sir, do you wanna destroy     
   Dominator or marry her?      

211
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:15,493
  Both. So get the watchdogs    
    and build a full-size       
      one of these ASAP.        

212
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,328
          I gotta do            
  some push-ups real quick.     

213
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,898
No. We are not building         
the Haterv.                     

214
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,134
   You're saying it wrong.      
         H.A.T.E.R.V.           

215
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,171
Dominator's ship                
is refueling on                 
the planet Argite 7.            

216
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,339
    We have a very narrow       
      window for action.        

217
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,342
 We can't waste any resources   
     on an oversized toy.       

218
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:35,446
    Toy?! No H.A.T.E.R.V.,      
          no Hater.             

219
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,148
 Handle the attack yourself.    

220
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,084
           Really?              
         You mean it?           

221
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,687
    Yep. You're gonna have      
 to lead the watchdogs alone.   

222
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,389
      Good luck with...

224
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,538
        Push forward.           
        No surrender.           

225
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,873
          Be ready.             

226
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,441
    As soon as our forces       
       reach Dominator,         

227
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,010
   we need to hit her with      
the Frostonium at close range.  

228
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,012
        Wait. What is...        

229
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,548
          - Oh, no.             
       - Hey, Peepers.          

230
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,517
         Guess what!            

231
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,118
      He built it himself.      

232
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,289
       I built it myself!       

233
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,058
          Oh, yeah,             
      perfect entrance.         

234
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,993
      Show me the love,         
            baby.               

235
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,696
    ( watchdogs yelling )       

236
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,133
           Um, hello.           

237
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,736
     Super cool guy with        
totally tricked-out ride here.  

238
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,405
       Way cooler than          
     some stupid battle.        

239
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,542
PEEPERS: Important battle.      
Very important battle.          

240
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,477
          Uh, should            
         we restack?            

241
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,546
     I gotta get my ride        
     in her line of sight       

242
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,015
     for maximum impact.        

243
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,551
Oh, I like stacking             
though.                         

244
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:52,190
Hey, Dominator,                 
look at me.                     

245
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,559
         Never mind.            
         Don't look.            

246
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,994
           Do over,             
           do over.             

247
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,931
      Hey, Dominator...         
         Ah, dang it!           

248
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,403
        Oh, my tailbone.        

249
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,573
            Nice.               

250
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,275
       Hey, Dominator.          
         No, no, no.

00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,609

252
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,078
       Okay, new plan.          

253
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,982
         Did she see            
        the cool part?          

254
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,587
        This is it, men.        

255
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,888
         We have her            
       full attention.          

256
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,425
        Oh! It's fine.          
   Play it cool, lover boy.     

257
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,460
       Stick to the plan.       

258
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,496
       Time to activate         
         flight mode!           

259
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,203
        Stupid thing.           

260
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,972
        Looked cooler           
      in the commercial.        

261
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,646
       Yeah, flight mode!       

262

266
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,460

00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,595

     Why isn't she looking?     

270
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,534
It's like all she cares about   
    is stopping you guys.       

271
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,304
              Tell me about it! 

272
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,772
       Time to pull out

        New new plan.

     What... what happened?

  Come on, men, we're almost    
         at the top.            

282
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,170

         hard to get.           

285
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,043
    It's time to activate...

290
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,242

       attention to me?         

291
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,210

          Look now.             

292
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,213

       Time for Sub Mode!

      Peepers, there is         
         no sub mode.

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,057

   Should we help him?

00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:46,264
            No. Don't help him.

and I promise                   
she'll be really impressed.     

328
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,948
       Okay, watchdogs,         
         this is it.            

329
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,484
         Coordinated            
       four-way ambush.         

330
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,986
            Land!               

331
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,121
    ( watchdogs yelling )       

332
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,790
              Air!              

333
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,627

334
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,730

338
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,380
Hey, babe, why don't you come   
take a ride on the Hater side?  

339
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,833
          I did it.             

340
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,236
         This is it.            
      ( exhales loudly )        

341

343
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,682
         Hey. Cool car.         

344
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,750
            What?               

345
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,552
         Uh, really?            

346
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,753
          You like it?          

347
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,722
          Oh, yeah.             

348
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,058
          The fists,            
         the pizzas.            

349
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,860
   The incredibly powerful      
      Frostonium weapon.        

350
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,762
      That was... gift.         

351
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:32,763
       I got you gift.          

352
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,832
         Oh, really?            

353
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,702
In that case,                   
mind if I take it               
for a spin?                     

354
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,870
      Oh, yes, come on.         
         You got her.           

355
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,906
         Now set off            
       the Frostonium.          

356
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,774
      Come on, set it off.      

357
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,743
  Wait. What are you doing?     

358
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,678
    Don't give her the keys.    

359
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,947
   Don't let her drive it!      

360
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,466
          Retreat!!             

361
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,943
        ( shrieking )           

362
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,585
I love you.                     

363
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,820
          Ugh, I know.          

364
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,904
       HATER: Peepers,          
      she likes my car.         

365
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,873
       ( Peepers groans )       

366
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,983
                ( sighs )       

367
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,851
( whip cracks )
