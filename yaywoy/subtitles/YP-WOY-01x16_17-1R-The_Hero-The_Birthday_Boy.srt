00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,295
 There was even                 
a lemonade stand.               

113
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,563
           Let's see you get out
            of this one, champ. 

114
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,198
 But don't worry!               

115
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,435
     It's a pattern,            
so all you got to do is--       

116
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,105
            No! No!             
    The hero does not need      
     the sidekick's help!       

117
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,579
         Now, clearly,          
  it's some sort of pattern.    

118
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,085
    ( Starlight screaming )     

119
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,922
Nice griffin. Ow!               

120
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,429
       Gah! the griffin         
         has my cape!           

121
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,396
 The griffin has my cape!       

122
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,070
            Get off!            

123
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,471
           My sword!            

124
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,074
   Your sidekick tom-foolery    
     has cost me my sword!      

125
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,375
     The prophecy specifically  

126
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,844
        states the hero         
      has a mighty sword!       

127
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,512
          Is this mighty enough?

128
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,451
   (gasps) The sword of Destiny!

129
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:55,354
      Forged in the fires       
     of a collapsing star,      

130
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,456
      the Andromeda Lords       
     themselves crafted it      

131
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,925
 so that only the most noble,   
       the most daring,         

132
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,327
        the most truly          
righteous hero could--          

133
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,397
Wha-- But the hero              
  is supposed to--              

134
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,332
Put it back! Put it back!       
      Put it back!              

135
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,469
     Oh, sorry. Don't know      
       my own strength.         

136
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,638
Ah, come on,                    
it's like you haven't           
even  <i>read </i> the prophecy.       

137
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,500
Ain't happening,                
     pretty boy.                

138
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,202
             Don't!             

139
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,226
     It's better this way!      

140
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,394
          Now come on.          
  Stop dilly-dallying.          

141
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,496
  We're gonna be late.          

142
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,366
          Helping a sister out. 
          Helping a sister out. 

143
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,435
          ( animal howling )    

144
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,409
         The day's end          
         may be nigh,           

145
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,445
         Princess Demura...     

146
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,013
         but fear not.          

147
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,515
      No barrier can keep       
       my love from you.        

148
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,318
       I shall smash the--      

149
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,986
         Oh, come on,           
       are you serious?         

150
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,388
       It was unlocked.         

151
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,223
       I don't care!            

152
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,624
        I need to make          
     a dramatic entrance.       

153
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,725
     Close it!                  

154
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:48,467
   No door is strong enough     
 to keep me from you, my love.  

155
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,536
 ( all growling )               

156
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,006
            Ahh!                

157
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,243
         For the princess!      

158
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,412
         Wait just a--          
     Come on, this is my--      

159
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,247
         I wanted to--          

160
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,216
            Stop!!!             

161
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,588
       All I want to do         
   is save my one true love     

162
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,491
    and have everyone know      
    how great a hero I am.      

163
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,493
          Just like             
 the prophecy says!             

164
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,728
    And you're ruining it,      
    ruining it, ruining it!     

165
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,997
    Why can't you get it?!      

166
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,167
           Sidekick!            
         Steed! Hero!           

167
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,668
                  Prisoner.     

168
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,518
    So these are the heroes     

169
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,419
          who've come           
      to steal my bride.        

170
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,356
     Well, you're too late      
        Sir Starlight!          

171
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,727
      Soon, the sun will set    
   and Princess Demura will be--

172
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,495
               DEMURA: ( gasps )
                   beloved.     

173
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,602
                She's beautiful!

174
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,272
 And pink. Ugh!                 

175
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,241
            Demura,             
   it is I, Brad Starlight.     

176
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,676
         Silence, cur!          

177
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,779
    ( shushing )                
 It's all right.                

178
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:11,816
There's no need to shout,       
   beloved, it's fine.          

179
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:15,153
           I'm so sorry, honey. 
               You know I--     

180
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,456
     I just want this day to be 
     perfect for you, you know. 

181
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,794
Oh, and it will be, Drake,      
as long as we're together.      

182
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:26,831
             Oh... You're pooky.

183
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,136
      Seriously, Bradley?       
          This again?           

184
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,671
              I'm sorry, did he 
             drag you two along 

185
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,606
                  on some crazy 
                 rescue mission?

186
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,816
It's not a crazy mission!       
 The prophecy foretold!         

187
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:48,520
               Prophecy?        
       You mean your diary from 
        when we were what, 15?  

188
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,257
                    (sighs)     
                Look, Brad.     

189
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,792
            I know this is hard,

190
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,528
       but things don't always  
     work out the way you want. 

191
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,598
        Life isn't a fairy-tale.

192
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,235
             Come on, we can    
         just be friends, right?

193
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,207
              No!               

194
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,146
 The princess will be mine!     

195
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,681
      The prophecy              
will be fulfilled!              

196
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,450
 ( laughing )                   

197
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,454
       Demura, my love.         
    We've got to save her.      

198
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,390
              You!              
What should we do?              

199
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,158
 Yes, you.                      

200
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,394
     Only one brave enough      
to conquer the insane labyrinth 

201
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,262
we set up to stop Bradley       
    is heroic enough            

202
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,698
   to help save                 
 Demura, right?                 

203
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,735
      I've always wanted        
      to save a princess.       

204
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,170
          Okay, guys!           

205
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,805
     New bad guy, new plan.     

206
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,374
      We're going to need       
          everybody's           

207
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,542
      individual talents        
       to pull this off!        

208
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:48,380
          ALL: Yeah!            
 We're all gonna have to work   
     together, as a team.       

209
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:49,814
         Yeah!                  

210
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:54,252
            Today,              
  we're all gonna be heroes!    

211
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,320
                 Yeah!          

212
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,891
    We're all collectively      
 coming to save you, princess!  

213
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,396
       Guys, it's fine.         
     I handled it myself.       

214
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,365
            Like I said,        
this isn't a fairy tale.        

215
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,335
                  Yeah!         

216
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,304
     That's why I love her.     

217
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,481
        And they lived          
      happily ever after.       

218
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,949
 Well, that's the plan,         

219
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,452
but real relationships          
   take a lot of work.          

220
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,754
              However,          
     if we listen, communicate, 

221
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,890
            and are sensitive   
         to each other's needs--

222
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,525
      Happily ever after!       

223
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,327
      We kind of sort of        
       saved a princess!        

224
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,495
       Wooooo!                  

225
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:51,443
Happy Birthday, Lord Hater!     

226
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,311
             So me and the guys 
               all chipped in   

227
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,946
                 and got you    
             a little something.

228
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,314
       Can you guess what it is?

229
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,450
      Is it a Doom Arena?       

230
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,618
              It's a Doom Arena!

232
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,391
I thought you might say that.   

233
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,359
  But don't worry,              
because our next gift           

234
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,329
   is sure to put               
a smile on your face.

 your most despised enemies     

237
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:21,639
 Wander and Sylvia!

    Boo! I hate those guys!

      See, Sylvia?              

240
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,378
          I told you            
it was a real party.            

241
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,447
                   Oh, look,    
               it's Mr. Peepers!

242
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,516
                    Mr. Peepers!

243
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,686
   Thank you for the invitation 
      to the birthday party!    

244
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,454
And you thought                 
it was a trap.                  

245
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,259
                  Yes! Best!    
             Birthday! Ever!    

246
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,961
   Not only do I get to watch   

247
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,964
     the destruction of my      
     most despised enemy,       

248
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,800
       I get to see him         
       cower before me!         

249
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:54,038
    To see that goofy grin      
   replaced with pure fear.     

250
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,573
   Yes!                         

251
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,082
                 Peepers!       

252
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,384
     There is a distinct lack   
   of cowering in my Doom Arena!

253
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,319
            That is contrary    
              to the purpose    

254
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,021
             of the Doom arena! 

255
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,956
           Wander, we've got to 
             get out of here.   

256
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,859
  Oh, come on, Sylvia,          
the party's not that bad.       

257
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,462
Although it is poorly           
     decorated.                 

258
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,763
And not very well attended.     

259
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,965
              And, worst of all,

260
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,767
               the birthday boy 
                does not appear 

261
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,970
                to be enjoying  
               the festivities. 

262
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,075
    Sylvia, we have to stay     
     in order to see that       

263
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:34,712
   Hater has fun on his most    
   special of special days.     

264
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,448
         It's up to us          
   to see that sad old scowl    

265
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,751
 replaced with a big old smile! 

266

               <i>Thunder noise!</i>   

267
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,757
Don't worry, sir.               

268
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,793
One groveling do-gooder         
   coming right up.             

269
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,532
             Yeah!              
           Get 'em!!            

270
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,600
          ( cheering )          

271
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,869
       Finally!                 
Some more party guests.         

272
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,538
But what are they               
gonna do for fun?               

273
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,507
     Crush us into a fine paste?

274
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,108
     Oh, Sylvia.                

275
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,478
I have a sure-fire plan to put  
   a smile on Hater's face.     

276
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,980
      All you need              
to do is make sure              

277
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,916
    those gladiators            
 can't see anything.            

278
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,518
         With pleasure.         

279
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,620
       Ladies? Shall we?        

280
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,589
              Yah!              

281
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,660
          Ah! My eye!           
         My only eye!           

282
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,104
                I really wish   
             I had a second eye!

283
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,607
        Put some glue,          
          more glue.            

284
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,508
         Oh, glitter,           
   definitely some glitter,     

285
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,010
   Hater loves glitter.         

286
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,980
                       Finished!

287
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,515
        Now, who wants          
   to show Hater a good time    

288
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,418
    by bashing his face in?     

289
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,622
     Hey! The party's over here,
          you optic nerds!      

290
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,831
   ( whooping ) Candy!

293
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,537
     Wander still appears       
   to be enjoying himself...    

294
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,574
             now at the Expense 
                 of my face!    

295
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,708
Don't worry, sir.               

296
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,543
     We have plenty             
of terrifying traps left.       

297
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,045
Well, let's see,                
meat tenderizer,                

298

00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,117
    ( groans ) Hurry up already.

300
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,453
Sylvia, Hater is still          
 not enjoying himself.          

301
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,522
The corners of his mouth        
are still pointing south.       

302
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,992
We got to spin that gram        
            into a grin.        

303
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,764
 Spin the bottle?

   the look on Hater's face?    

315
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,552
            I know.             
  Isn't that awful?
