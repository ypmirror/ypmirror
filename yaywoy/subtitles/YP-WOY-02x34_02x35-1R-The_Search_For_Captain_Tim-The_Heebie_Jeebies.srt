   the worst thing that         
   has ever happened!           

47
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,446

54
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,597

           Taquitos!

00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,402
          You rang?             
         Who are you?           

58
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,271
 I'm Tim,                       
 the lovable Watchdog!          

59
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,639
       No, I'm looking          
       for Captain Tim!         

60
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,975
   Ooh, I'm a captain now?      
        What? Ew, no!           

61
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,810
     You're the wrong Tim       
     and always will be!        

62
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,445
     My mistake!                

63
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,746
         Tiiiiiiii...!          

64
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,721
Yeah?                           
Oops, sorry. Not me.            

65
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,590
          Watchdogs!            

66
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,459
We have toppled mighty empires, 

67
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,828
laid waste to fearsome enemies. 

68
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,266
But today we face               
a mission more important than   
any we've ever encountered.     

69
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:50,469
    (Weeping like a baby)       
   My Tim-Tim went bye-bye      

70
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,837
  and I don't know where he is  

71
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,106
       I miss my Tim-Tim!       

72
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,308
     (Weeping like a baby)

          ( cheering )          

74
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,678
     WATCHDOG: He's gone.       
         We survived!           

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,980
          The nightmare is over!

76
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,882
     Happy Tim-Tim is gone?     

77
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,617
           Overjoyed!           

78
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,718
            Hahaha!             

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,287
             Whoo!              

80
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,721
      Oh, uh, sorry, sir.       

81
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,157
     I know you cared           
     for that... thing,         

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,360
    but Captain Tim wasn't      
 really a pet so much as a...   

83
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,463
  um, hideous monster trying    
to maul everybody on the ship.  

84
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,534
    But he was my hideous       
    monster trying to maul      
    everybody on the ship!      

85
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,538
        Whoo-hoo! Yeah!         

86
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,074
         ( sobbing )            
      Well, forget them!        

87
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,743
        I am the great          
   and terrible Lord Hater!     

88
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,145
      I get what I want,        
         when I want,           

89
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:35,714
        and right now           
    I want my buddy back!       

90
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,884
       I shall unleash          
 all of my power to find him!   

91
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,485
          Excuse me,            
   have you seen this Tim?      

92
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,688
    Hey, has anyone tried       
to eat your face off recently?  

93
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,489
   Do you have a tummy ache?    

94
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,792
     'Cause sometimes he        
   spits acid in your tummy     
    while you're sleeping.      

95
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,096
  Has anyone seen Captain Tim?  

96
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,632
      ( loud screeching )       

97
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,370
 Yeah. I've seen that... thing. 

98
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,939
   Every night in my dreams     
 before I wake up screaming,    

99
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,408
 drenched in sweat and regret.  

100
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,847
                  So...you have 
          seen him then, or...? 

101
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,781
   I know his kind!             

102
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,183
    Arachnomorphs.              

103
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,051
Blood-sucking,                  
acid-spitting beasts            

104
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,854
that can tear through the hull  
of your ship like tissue paper  

105
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,956
     or your entire crew...     

106
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,191
              That's my Tim-Tim!

107
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,792
    Name's Ripov.               

108
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,961
I've been trackin'              
the trail of mayhem and tears   

109
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,963
his species has spread          
across the galaxy.              

110
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,398
        Kinda like a dogcatcher?

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,233
    Yeah. Kinda.                

112
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,036
But I'm always                  
one step behind them.           

113
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,439
Never met anyone 'sides me      
who came up against one         
and survived.                   

114
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,441
With your help,

Aaahhh!                         

231
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,503
    Never leave me again.       
       Never ever ever.         

232
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,140
             You!               
      Pretty impressive.        

233
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,576
Even I couldn't take out        
a 'Morph Queen like that.       

234
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:47,679
 I guess bad things can change. 

235
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,415
             Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh?  

236
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,654
            ( content growl )   

237
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,689
              Aww!              

238
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:58,990
              Aww!              

239
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,326
         ( screaming )          

240
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,331
     Heh, Heh. Baby steps.      

241
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,167
    Hee hee hee!                
    Quit it! OK! Hahaha!        

242
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,337
      Oh, Tim you always        
    brighten up a bad day!      

243
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,905
      ( loud screeching )       

244
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,513
        ( owl hooting )         

245
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,215
       SYLVIA: <i> Deep in</i>         
  <i> the darkest woods I hide.</i>    

246
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,986
       <i> I keep you safe</i>         
  <i> from what lurks outside.</i>     

247
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,156
     <i> Even the strongest</i>        
   <i> cannot resist my power.</i>     

248
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,559
    <i> I can strike anyone,</i>       
    <i> anywhere at any hour.</i>      

249
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,195
    Only once you master me     

250
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,798
  will you defeat your enemy.   

251
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,366
         Yeesh. Creepy.         

252
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,334
       Ah, this riddle          
   doesn't make any sense,      

253
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,903
       but the map says         
      this is the place.        

254
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:48,206
   Somewhere in these woods     
    lies an ancient power,      

255
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,342
      a power that could        
   help us stop Dominator!      

256
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,712
     So all we have to do       
    is carefully sneak in,      

257
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,346
       run a meticulous         
     survey of the area,        

258
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,315
  approach the ancient power    
     with caution and...        

259
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,884
   You're already in there,     
         aren't you?            

260
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,188
             Um...              

261
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,056
     Isn't this is where        
     you leave me hanging       

262
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,658
     and charge headlong        
  into some horrible danger     

263
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,661
        you're somehow          
   oblivious to... or not?      

264
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,629
        ( creepy music )        

265
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,067
    Wander, you're not...scared?

266
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,235
                      What?     

267
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,370
           Nooo, Of course not! 

268
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:24,209
 Everyday is an adventure and   
everything is amazing, right?   

269
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,378
     I just...got a bad feeling 
           about this Sylvia... 

270
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,947
     this place gives me...     

271
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,019
I'm sure there's puh-lenty of   
other ways to thwart Dominator  

272
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,289
          that aren't hidden in 
       a dark and gloomy forest 
         of terror and despair. 

273
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,592
          So let's Orbble on    
          outta here and see--  

274
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,295
Wander, nothing in this forest  
could possibly be as terrifying 

275
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,631
   as Dominator destroying      
      the entire galaxy.        

276
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,234
     But what if there's        
 a Frankenstein in there...?    

277
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,302
    Wander, there is not a--    

278
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,639
            ( roar )            

279
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,642
         Forest bad!            
         ( crashes )            

280
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,712
     Well... there aren't       
      any in there now!         

281
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,380
     Seriously, what are        
      you so afraid of?         

282
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,116
            Come on.            

283
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,451
            Wander.             

284
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,561
        ( Wander sighs )        

285
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,563
      You're right, Syl.        
      This ain't so bad!        

286
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,964
      ( screams in fear )       

287
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,168
  Sylvia! We're already lost!   

288
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,472
     Wander! Just relax.        
Try taking some deep breaths.   

289
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,910
       ( wood creaking )        

290
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,845
   ( creaking and snapping )    

291

          ( scream )            

292
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:40,518
           Wander,              
  leaves rustle in the wind.    

293
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,921
               Old trees creak. 
                   ( creaking ) 

294
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,657
    And twigs are snapping      
because I'm stepping on them.   

295
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,260
       ( slow snapping )        

296
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,528
       ( Wilhelm scream )       

297
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,431
Aw, don't worry,                
that's just a Wilhelm Warbler!  

298
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,166
       ( Wilhelm scream )       

299
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,836
Annoying and all over the place,
but totally harmless.           

300
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,239
        ( impact grunt )

303
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,619
         ( bat calls )

      ( whispering winds )      

305
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,893
       Syl! Thing! Woods!       

306
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,963
           Wander,              
    there's nothing there.      

307
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,898
Your eyes are just              
spooking out your head, buddy.  

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,567
       And if there was?        

309
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,237
Lady and Dutchess               
won't let anything hurt you,    

310
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,605
      and neither will I.       

311
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,247
       ( spooky noises )

        ( owl hooting )         

313
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,589
              Ha!               

314
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,091
                Now what?       

315
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,761
          ( growling )          

316
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,930
     Wander, I don't know       
   what's gotten into you,      

317
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,832
      but you're seeing         
   stuff that's just not--      

318
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,000
                     There!     

319
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,669
 OK, look...                    

320
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,737
                     Behind you!

321
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,343
           Sylvia!!!            

322
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,612
            Wander?             

323
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,282
        Mime! Phantom!          
         Phantomime!            

324
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,550
   Oh, no, I've named them,     
   thus giving them power!      

325
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,053
               ( whimpering )   

326
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,521
Calm down, buddy.               

327
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,623
Your super-vivid imagination    
has taken the wheel             

328
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,592
and is driving you bonkers.     

329
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,294
You need a distraction.

00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,526
              Guys, stop!       

351
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,028
          ( scream )            
           Wander.              

352
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,765
  OK, OK, it's all good, pal.   

353
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,301
 There's nothing around here    
     except your best bud       

354
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,237
and I'm not gonna let           
anything happen to you, got it? 

355
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,041
Maybe you need some rest.       

356
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,542
             You're right, Syl. 

357
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,178
As long as I've got             
my bestest bud by my side,      

358
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,347
I've got no reason to hide!     

359
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,884
       Bud by my side...        

360
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,253
      no reason to hide...      

361
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,023
          ( snoring )           

362
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,863
    Sylvia? Hello? Syl...?      

363
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,033
       King Binglebord,         
         is that you?           

364
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,603
           ( scream )           

365
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,581
           ( scream )           

366
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,216
             Phew!              

367
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,985
       Just a dream.            

368
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,587
           ( scream )           

369
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,690
  Phew! That was just a dream.  

370
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,025
           ( scream )           

371
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,996
      Phew. Just a dream        
    in a dream in a dream.      

372
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:46,664
    Frankenphantomimenstein!    

373
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,766
           ( scream )           

374
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,969
           ( scream )           

375
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,605
      Wander, you okay ?        

376
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,613
    Huh? Oh, wow,               
    what a crazy dream.         

377
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,251
  Wait, that ancient scroll?    
           Got it.              

378
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,753
       Did it give you          
        a great power?          

379
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,521
 Dom won't know what hit her!   

380
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,722
              Then that means...

381
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,691
There was nothing               
to be afraid of.                

382
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,460
            ( sigh )            

383
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,661
               Unless...        

384
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,231
  Awwww, man! Come on!          

385
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,632
            Sylvia?             

386
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,601
    Where are you?              

387
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,873
   Oh, right, I'm obviously     
       still dreaming.          

388
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,375
 ( slap ) Nope, still there.    
    ( slap ) Still there.       

389
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,045
           Oh no...             

390
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:37,148
   Sylviiiiiaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!    

391
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,889
 I noticed the fire             
 was dying so...I...Wander?     

392
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,824
    Wander? Can you hear me?    

393
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,959
    Wander, where are you?      

394
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,663
          Wan...der?            

395
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,632
          W-Wander...?          

396
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,667
      Don't goof around.        

397
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,742
    Sweet jumpin' flabbdraserry 
               in a handbasket, 
                  he was right! 

398
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,645
             ( scream ) Wander! 

399
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,414
    She'll find me.             
    She always finds me.        

400
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,150
    She'll find me,             
    they always find me.        

401
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,784
          They'll find me,      
          they always find me.  

402
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,786
                Mimes find me.  

403
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,256
 I'm really tired of screaming! 

404
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:22,760
    Aaaaaahhh!                  

405
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,529
           Aaaaaaahhhhhhh!      

406
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,696
       ( impact grunts )        

407
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,265
               Ah, you're OK!   

408
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,699
Thank grop, you're alive!       

409
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,334
                        Sylvia, 
          I've got a lil' hunch 

410
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,336
           we are not welcome   
           in these woods.      

411
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,240
Agreed. Ancient power           
or no ancient power, I say      
get the grop outta here!        

412
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,744
              Ow!               

413
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,727
   Stop bouncin', ya creeps!    

414
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,370
  Oh, that's actually           
  way creepier.                 

415
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:10,408
      I'm sorry, Syl!           
      This looks like the end!  

416
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,712
      Hey! You want me?         
       Come and get me.         

417
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,648
But keep your jazz hands        
offa my best friend!            

418
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,520
No! You can't go                
through her to get to me,       

419
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,822
because you have to             
go through me to get to her!    

420
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,293
 No, I'm gonna protect you.     

421
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,398
  Nuh-uh! Let me protect you!   

422
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,368
  Sylvia... look!               

423
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,370
    Huh? Where'd they go...?    

424
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,940
Look, Syl. They only show up    
when you're scared.             

425
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,642
       Ooo. Idea!               

426
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,446
       Wander? Wander?          
        Where are you?          

427
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,749
        I'm here, Syl.          
          ( sighs )             

428
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,783
            Wander!             

429
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:53,784
 Hiya, Syl.                     

430
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,386
            ( sigh )            

431
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,388
            Wander!             

432
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,090
           Wander!              
            Howdy.              

433
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,758
           Wander!              
        How do you do?          

434
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,826
            Quit it.            

435
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,970
Sylvia, I'm very, very, very,   
    very glad you're okay,      

436
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:16,607
        but I'm sorry we didn't 
           find the great power 
             to stop Dominator. 

437
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,409
But we did find it, Wander.     

438
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,311
The answer to                   
the scroll's riddle,            

439
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:23,547
   "Only once you master me     
 will you defeat your enemy."   

440
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,782
      It's fear!                

441
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,984
There's more power              
in overcoming your fear         

442
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,786
than in any weapon.             

443
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,889
Even Dominator isn't as scary   
as the thought of losing you.   

444
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,958
 And without anybody to scare,  

445
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,395
        those Phantomimes are   
        powerless to petrify    
        any more people...      

446
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,996
             right?             

447
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,834
    ( creepy circus music )     

448
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,210
    ( creepy circus music )
