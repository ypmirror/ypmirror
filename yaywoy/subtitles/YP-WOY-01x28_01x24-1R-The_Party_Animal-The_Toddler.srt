              OH, STUBBORN, HUH?

227
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,947

228
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,627
ALL RIGHT, KIDDO,               
YOU'VE GIVEN ME                 
NO OTHER OPTION.                

229
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:27,498
      ( Sylvia straining        
        and laughing )          

230
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,001
       UGH. WE ARE NEVER        
         HAVING KIDS.           

231
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,470
     WE'RE NOT HIS PARENTS.     

232
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,478
ISN'T THE BIG LADY              
A BIG SILLY WILLY?              

233
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,547
THAT'S RIGHT, SYLVIA.           

234
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,116
YOU'RE GIVING HIM               
WHAT HE WANTS. FUN!             

235
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,426
       ( babbling )             

236
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,999
             DING!              

237
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,771
                OH, HUCKLEBERRY 
                   KNUCKLEHEAD.

242
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,469
                   SEE, SYLVIA? 
                ALL IT TOOK WAS 
        A LITTLE FUN AND GAMES. 

243
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,471
                  NOW I GOT HIM 
        RIGHT WHERE I WANT HIM. 

244
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,176
                SH! DON'T SPOIL 
                  THE SURPRISE.

00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,082
          PEEK-A-BOO.           

248
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,486
   EXCUSE ME. PARDON. SORRY.    

249
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,021
                     I KNOW I'M 
                DOING IT WRONG. 

250
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,633
                UH-OH.          

251
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,035
            ( people screaming )

252
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,842
HUCKLEBERRY                     
KNUCKLEHEAD!                    

253
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,577
                      STILL NOT 
                   A REAL NAME. 

254
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,518
                    HUCKLEBERRY!

255
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,038
         OH!                    

256
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
               ROARIN' ORANGE.  

257
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,243
        BACK UPSTAIRS.          
      SAM'S SLUSHY STAND.       

258
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,857
          THERE HE IS!          

259
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,059
               HE'S SOCIALIZING 
                       SO WELL. 

260
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,930
               HUCK, NO.        

261
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,768
   SYLVIA, WE CAN SOLVE THIS    
WITHOUT STIFLING HIS CREATIVITY.

262
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,070
         D-OH! WANDER,          
      YOU'RE NOT HELPING.       

263
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,817
          ( gasping )           

264
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:40,124
    ( ear-piercing shriek )     

265
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,798
        THAT'S MY BOY.          
     WHAT A SET OF PIPES.       

266
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,304
YOU TWO ARE                     
HORRIBLE PARENTS.               

267
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,772
           LEARN HOW TO CONTROL 
                      YOUR KID. 

268
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,741
             YOU TAKE THAT BACK.

269
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,043
        HE IS A PERFECT         
         LITTLE ANGEL.          

270
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,311
HE'S NOT OUR KID!               

271
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,284
    WHAT? WHAT'S HAPPENING?     

272
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,119
       WHAT DOES IT WANT?       

273
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,188
         AW, POOR LITTLE FELLA. 
         HE'S ALL TUCKERED OUT. 

274
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,123
         HE WANTS SOME          
       COMFORT, SYLVIA.         

275
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,659
       UM, HOW YA DOIN'?        

276
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,861
 ( loud belch )                 

277
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,996
         WELL, THIS IS          
          UNPLEASANT.           

278
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,364
      WHAT? WANDER, LOOK.       

279
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,333
          OUR PRAYERS           
      HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.       

280
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,801
      HEY, WE FOUND YOUR KID!   

281
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:27,605
                    SH! SYLVIA! 
            YOU'LL WAKE HIM UP. 

282
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,774
   ( loud whispering ) GOOD.    
 IF YOU STOPPED CODDLING HIM,   

283
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,310
   AND TOOK CHARGE FOR ONCE,    
  HE MIGHT LISTEN LONG ENOUGH   

284
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,011
      SO WE COULD GET HIM       
          TO SECURITY           

285
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,013
         AND FIND HIS           
    FLARF-NARBLING PARENTS.     

286
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,149
           WELL, IF YOU STOPPED 
               BEING SO STRICT, 

287
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,251
              AND DID SOMETHING 
                  FUN FOR ONCE, 

288
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,819
                HE MIGHT LISTEN 
                    LONG ENOUGH 

289
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,621
                SO WE COULD GET 
                HIM TO SECURITY 

290
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,089
                   AND FIND HIS 
        FLARF-NARBLING PARENTS. 

291
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:49,694
        AND I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT 
      THEY NARBLE FLARFS, IMHO. 

292
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,330
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT              
THEY REALLY NARBLED             
FLARFS.                         

293
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,832
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.              
IT'S A FIGURE OF...             

294
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,635
( loud crying )                 

295
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,370
                   NOW LOOK WHAT
                   YOU'VE DONE. 

296
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,806
  ME? YOU WERE THE ONE WHO...   

297
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,241
          WHY ARE WE            
       STILL WHISPERING?        

298
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,309
                        I'M NOT 
                 ENTIRELY SURE. 

299
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,430
                   DON'T WORRY, 
                   HUCKLEBERRY. 

300
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:30,034
            MEE-MAW AND PEE-PAW 
                ARE JUST HAVING 
                A DISAGREEMENT. 

301
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,169
 WE'RE NOT HIS PARENTS.         

302
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,436
         ( whimpering )         

303
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,375

        and screaming )

330
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,187
          ( kissing )           

331
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,122
               WAIT. THOSE ARE--

332
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,191
     WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,       
   HUCKLEBERRY KNUCKLEHEAD?     

333
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,993
         AND THAT'S REALLY HIS--

334
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:04,829
        YOU HAD US WORRIED SICK.

335
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,764
DON'T BE TOO HARD               
ON HIM, DEAR.                   

336
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,432
ARE YOU HUNGRY, THIRSTY,        
OVERTIRED, UNDER-TIRED?         

337
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,967
HOW'S ABOUT A GAME              
OF GOTCHERNOSE?                 

338
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,769
             WELL, BYE-BYE, KID.

339
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,237
               COME ON, WANDER. 
                      LET'S GO. 

340
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,973
      CAN I SAY GOOD-BYE?       

341
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,849
OH, I HOPE IT WASN'T            
TOO MUCH TROUBLE                

342
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,384
GETTING HIM                     
OVER HERE.                      

343
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,286
HE CAN BE                       
A BIT OF A HANDFUL.             

344
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,820
              NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

345
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,556
                 IT WAS EASY AS 
         TAKING CANDY FROM A... 

346
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,458
                        DROP IT!

347
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,164
              OH, STUBBORN, HUH?

348
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,166
              WELL, GUESS WHAT. 
                     I AM, TOO. 

349
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,890
       ( baby babbling )
