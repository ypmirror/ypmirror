Watch your step.                

15
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,785
Lovely day                      
for a mass evacuation.          

16
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,820

       That's less good!

Wander, are you nuts?           

33
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,784
     This place is gonna

              But, Sylvia, look!

35
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,857
Ah, so you are nuts.            
       Good to know.            

36
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,859
                   We can't     
               just leave them. 

37
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,262
     They're too cute to perish 
       in a pool of hot magma!  

38
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,097
       Don't worry, little guys.

39
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,299
                  I know things 
                 seem bleak now.

40
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,935
               But I have a plan
                and I promise,  

41
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,404
      no one shall die this day!

         ( squawking )          

44
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,783
         Wander, it's impossible
          to try and save them. 

45
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:32,784
                 We can't do it!

46
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,186
           ( sniffs )           

47
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,421
     Eww!                       
You smell that?                 

48
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:40,392
Oh, you mean 10,000 gallons     
   of hot liquid death?         

49
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,427
    No.                         
( sniffs )                      

50
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:46,932
It smells like a big pile       
   of "can't doo-doo."          

51
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,868
Woowee!                         
Come on, Syl.                   

52
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,403
How many times                  
do I got to tell ya?            

53
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,805
Anything is possible            
with a pep in your step         

54
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,207
 and a grin on your chin.       

55
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,677
       What you need            
is a positive can-dotitude!     

56
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,780
         ( explosion )          

57
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,081
            Observe.            

58
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,859
     I have complete            
and total confidence            

59
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,461
  that I will scoop up          
this lovely little family       

60
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,096
and carry them to safety,       

61
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,466
thus saving them                
from a burn-y lava-y demise.    

62
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,835
         ( shrieking )          

63
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,137
         Ow!                    

64
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,308
What a good mama you are!       

65
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,410
Let's try this again.           

66
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,411
 Aah!                           

67
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,379
      ( sheepish chuckle )      

68
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:38,383
Can-dotitude can often require  
      try-try-againiness.       

69
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,420
        Ee-ow!                  
           Ow!                  

70
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,721
I respect that.                 

71
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,022
     Yee-ow!                    

72
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,857
You're so protective!           

73
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,858
             Ow-ow!             

74
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,026
              Ow!               

75
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,028
Now let's go!                   

76
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,430
 Ee-ow!                         

77
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,431
            This can't end well.

80
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,841
Whoa, slow down there,          
              Scaredy!          

81
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,377
Where's the fire?               
Um, everywhere.                 

82
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,814
Gah, get back here!             

83
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,183
             I'm-- agh--        
trying to save your kid.        

84
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,831
Oh, great! Now we'll            
never find him in time.         

85
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,032
We're doomed!                   

86
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,935
           Sylvia, can-dotitude!

00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,509
            Remember, everybody,

90
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:41,313
   the path to positive thinking
    starts with a single step.  

91
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,081
          ( screams )           

92
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,260
Scaredy!                        
We're so happy                  
we found you here.              

93
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,496
SYLVIA:                         
Inside the volcano!             

94
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,341
Wander!                         

95
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,409
Ow!                             

96
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,845
 Hang on!                       

97
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,583
                We're saved!    

98
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,560
       Or not.                  

99
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,229
   Wander, these little guys    
can't make a jump like that.    

100
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,398
          I told you            
this was impossible.            

101
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,535
                  No! The chasm 
           between can-dotitude 

102
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,171
           and give-uppittiness 
               may be wide,     

103
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,874
             but I believe      
       you can bridge that gap! 

104
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,209
Wait, what now?                 

105
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,012
        You can bridge that gap.

106
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,386
         ( whimpering )         

107
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,254
    Oh, no, no, no, no, no.     

108
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,459
           ( grunts )           

109
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:03,028
      See, kids,                
Sylvia's got it, right?         

110
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,629
     You just have to look      
        deep, deep down         

111
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,599
      and find that spark       
      in yourselves and--       

112
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,302
       Enough pep talk!         
          Just hurry!           

113
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,436
           Sorry.               

114
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,241
            I'm gonna           
 try to pick up your kids, see. 

115
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,909
             And then I'm gonna 
                hug 'em, see.   

116
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,444
           And you're not gonna 
               like it, see.    

117
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,451
          ( screams )           

118
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,167
    I can't hold on much...     

119
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,204
              Hmm?              

120
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,942
Agh!                            
Tiny!                           

121
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,978
             Alan.              
             Alan?              

122
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,446
Looks like an Alan.             
Do something, okay?             

123
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,482
But he's too far!               

124
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,317
    Alan! I know everything     
       seems bleak-- Ow!        

125
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,987
   But you've got to channel    
   that positive power and--    

126
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,556
           Ow!                  
         Jump!                  

127
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,024
         Are you crazy?         

128
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,593
You can-dodit it, dude!         

129
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,173
             Yeah!              

130
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,241
              No!               

131
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,116
      Phew!

134
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,568
  Question, what do you call    
       that pointy thing        

135
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,170
        that hangs down         
         from a cave?           

136
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,173
       Not the best time        
  for a geology quiz, Wander!   

137
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,375
        Just wondering          
       if I should yell         

138
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,812
 "Grab onto that stalagmite!"   
or "Grab onto that stalactite!" 

139
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,550
              Everybody hang on!

140
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,465
        I admire-- ow--         
       your consistency.

00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,702
              Ow!               

143
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,604
               Get ready!       

144
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,039
          ( screams )           

145
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,383
       I will take that         
        as a thank-you.

     to take care of you?

We can't send a defenseless     
little ball of fluff            
like this out alone!            

227
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,386
     Come on, Little Bits,      

228
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,788
             we're taking you   
           to a distant relative

229
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,856
                     or perhaps 
              a kooky cat lady. 

230
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,693
    Just saying,                
when I was your size,           

231
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,396
I already had a good job        
      scraping graz bits        

232
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:18,396
 out of plasma cores.           

233
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:22,300
    ( Little Bits sneezes )     
           ( gasps )            

234
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,302
              Oh, my gosh,      
         she's catching a cold! 

235
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,770
    ( Little Bits sniffles )    

236
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,472
 Sylvia, we have to warm her up 
          immediately!          

237
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,541
 Jeez, calm down.               

238
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,477
We'll just get her              
a warm orange fur coat?         

239
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,647
         How's that, sugar lump?

240
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,584
    ( Little Bits giggles )     

241
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,487
          ( groaning )          

242
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,771
         You sure we're heading 
       the right way, fuzzball? 

243
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,174
'Cause we just left             
   the only town                

244
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,110
 on this entire planet, so...   
   ( Little Bits whimpers )     

245
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,379
                      ( gasps ) 
           Oh no! What's wrong? 

246
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,482
                       Oh no!   

247
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,451
              Your poor exposed 
               little footsies. 

248
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,520
         How could we have been 
             so insensitive?    

249
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,122
         Sylvia, we're monsters!

250
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,491
Oh, I'm sure our gifts of food  
         and clothing           

251
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,427
 have scarred her for life.     

252
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,696
( sighs )                       
You want me to carry her?       

253
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,531
   What's your preferred style, 
              ma'am?            

254
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,133
                    Piggy-back? 
                 Horsey-saddle? 
                 Fireman carry? 

255
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,768
                   Kangaroozle? 
                     Anything!  

256
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,570
               Just let me know 
                what you want.  

257
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,816
             Ouch!              

258
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,117
              Ow!               

259
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,118
              Oof!              

260
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,387
       ( painful grunts )       

261
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,390
Wander, buddy,                  
at least let me carry you.      

262
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,625
Naw-uh.                         

263
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,527
      Got to keep a close       
       eye on our girl.         

264
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,528
       Just in case.            

265
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,464
           ( gasps )            
           Watch out            

266
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,767
         ( Little Bits giggles )

267
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,110
 Wander, we need to talk.       

268
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,845
             Isn't she adorable?

269
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,680
         ( shrieking )          

270
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,583
          ( growling )          

271
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,658
 Wander, don't!                 

272
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,495
         ( loud crash )

274
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,670
             Again.             

275
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,607
            She likes this game.

276
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,575
          ( panting )

00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,624
    Again.                      
  All right,                    
that's enough!                  

279
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,292
Yeah,                           
I don't think so, missy.        

280
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,528
You had enough fun              
with Wander.                    

281
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,530
Now take us to your             
kooky cat lady or whatever.     

282
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,598
Wander ain't got nine lives,    
you know.                       

283
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,503
( snarling )                    

284

286
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,843
          This is why           
      I don't have pets.        

287
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,612
 And now I know                 

288
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,049
all 17 of Lord Hater's

       ( snoring gently )       

292
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,496
Aw, Sylvia, look.               
She's using me as a pillow.

299

   there's something real weird.

300
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,621
What's that, Little Bits?

 As soon as the pad is charged

you will be dewivered to Hater

  I'll never leave his side.

    Wherever he goes, I go.     

389

And we're not going             
     anywhere.

                Did we help her?

394
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,355
I like to think we did.         

395
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:06,424
Now can we head back            
            to town?

          wrong with your eyes.
