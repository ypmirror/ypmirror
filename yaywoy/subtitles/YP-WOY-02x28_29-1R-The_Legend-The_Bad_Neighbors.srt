  Gaaahh! I knew it!

 This is a terrible plan!

                   No, Peepers, 
      this could actually work.

 If we simply replace Dominator 
          with Emperor Awesome, 

347
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,177
    we could totally ruin

Who cares about the cul-de-sac?

    The galaxy is in danger!

Do you really wanna know        
how to stop that guy?

00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:06,637
 Just throw                     
 a better barbecue!             

357
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,874
     Set the grill flame        
       to 456 degrees!

   Turn! Flip! Turn! Flip!

 Way to go, Peepers! Couldn't   
have planned it better myself.  

375
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,761
        Wait. Do you mean to say

377
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,900

378
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,536
                    to break me 
       out of my planning funk?
