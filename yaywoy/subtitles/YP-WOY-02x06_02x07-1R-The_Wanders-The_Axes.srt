     Tree Hugger Wander.        
  Man, scope out that view.     

114
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,594
              That's amazing!   

115
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,530
         Hero Wander.           
        I'll save you!          

116
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,933
      Blonde Wig Wander.        
        ( screaming )           

117
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,469
  I'll save you.

00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,906
That's amazing!                 
( laughing )                    

119
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,941
  Woohoo!                       

120
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,042
      ( Wanders yelling         
       in excitement )          

121
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,849
    SYLVIA: I can't do this!    

122
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,486
          I love you.           

123
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,589
I love you.                     
I love you. I love you.         

124
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,191
              Don't be all down 
                  in the dumps. 

125
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,593
   It's always sunny somewhere, 
              Sylvie, ol' girl. 

126
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:06,031
Sylvia, Sylvia, she's our man,  
if she can't do it, no one can! 

127
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,034
   Yeah? Maybe you're right.    

128
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,939
             That's ama--

00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,047
        ( disgruntled )         

131
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,650
      Okay. Let's catch         
      some Wanders using        
    their traits as bait!       

132
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,018
That rhymed!                    
I love you.                     

133
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,326
Oh, no!                         
You're a mess!                  

134
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,994
                    Mess. Mess. 
          Did someone say mess? 

135
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,329
                      Clean up. 
               Clean it up now! 

136
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,097
             Obsessy via Messy? 
               Check and check. 

137
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,599
              That also rhymed! 
                    I love you. 

138
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,934
     Five down, 415 to go!      

139
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,070
       SYLVIA: Tea time!        

140
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,139
        Time for girls          
       to try on shoes          

141
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,241
           and talk             
      about lady things.        

142
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,945
Two helpless females            
all alone.                      

143
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,215
I hope no bad guys              
are nearby.                     

144
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:00,051
         ( screaming )          

145
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,555
         Help! Help!            
           Save me!             

146
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,190
        I'll save yo--          
           Save it.             

147
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,925
I'm the hero now.               

148
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,462
                   ( sniffing ) 
     Smell that righteous grub. 

149
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,666
            You're doing great. 
                    I love you. 

150
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:21,573
Gosh, oh golly,                 
those Wanders over there        
sure look sad.                  

151
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,678
        I love you all!         

152
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,531
      And heeere's Wander!      

153
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,099
               Wander?          

154
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,201
                 Come on, buddy.

155
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,336
                     Please?    

156
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,738
                  What's wrong? 
        I put them all back in. 

157
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,106
               Who did I forget?

158
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,443
      ( Wander laughing )       

159
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:02,280
       No. No. Not him.         
   He's the one that always     
    gets us into trouble.       

160
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,082
     And he won't listen        
        to me anyway.           

161
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,117
     If you don't accept        
          all of us,            

162
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,153
     you accept none of us.     

163
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,256
Whoooaa.                        
That's deep, dude.              

164
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:14,259
          He's just             
     gonna cause trouble        

165
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,027
           and then             
       I don't wanna...         

166
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,766
          ( sighing )           

167
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,401
        ( grumbling )           
    Flabdrassin' Wanders,       

168
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,704
 make me do the wrong things    
    for the right reasons.      

169
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,473
      ( Wander laughing )       

170
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:33,311
   Hm. This one always does     
 whatever I tell him not to.    

171
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,081
             Ding!              

172
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:57,302
           Gotcha!              
        ( struggling )          

173
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:01,139
        Are we sure about this? 
 'Cause my life is pretty crazy 
           with this one in it. 

174
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,112
    ( sighs ) But it'll be      
  so much worse without you.    

175
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,423
           Yeeee-haw!           

176
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,294
           Wander?              
       Are-are you okay?        

177
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,663
     I'm more than okay.        
         I'm perfect!           

178
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:28,166
        Now come, trusty steed, 
              it's time to stop 
      that heartless evil-doer, 

179
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,235
                    Lord Hater, 
              once and for all! 

180
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,636
                     Hyah!      

181
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,806
      Wait, what? Stop?         
    Yes. I am a good guy.       

182
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:38,143
And he is a bad guy.            
And I stop him.                 

183
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:41,713
                No, no, no, no. 
        The Wander I know wants 
             to befriend Hater, 

184
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,515
                 not stop him.  

185
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,251
   Wait. Why are all these      
other Wanders still up there?   

186
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,752
     Something's not right.     

187
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,693
     Wander. That crystal       
      has no reflection.        

188
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,861
     We're still missing        
      some part of you.         

189
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,830
         That's okay.           
 I'm a lot better without it.   

190
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,098
          Let's go go go.       

191
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,200
No.                             
I've learned my lesson.         

192
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,402
Every part                      
of you is important.            

193
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:24,155
   The helper seeks to help     
       because he knows         
  what it is to be helpless.    

194
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,125
Hey, little guy,                
it's okay. I won't hurt you.    

195
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,228
 Come on.                       

196
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,568
             Home.              

197
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,914
          Thanks, Syl.          

198
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,250
           That was             
   the most important part.     

199
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,557
                           Whoo.

200
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,792
                I wouldn't want 
                   someone else 

201
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,727
                  to go through 
           what I went through. 

202
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,263
Love that part of you,          
buddy.                          

203
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,538
        Over? What do           
     you mean it's over?        

204
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,208
     But I conquered you!       
  Your planet belongs to me.    

205
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,344
        Belonged to you.        

206
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,312
   Look, you really haven't     
  been around a lot lately,     

207
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,182
   so we weren't even sure      
      if you were still         
   underruling us anymore,      

208
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,185
         so we, like, uh, well, 
           we met someone else. 

209
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,255
      Someone else? Who?        
   Is it Emperor Awesome?       

210
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,257
        The black cube          
         of darkness?           

211
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,259
           Dominator!           

212
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,227
          It's a...             
       it's the, uh...          

213
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,329
         Evil sandwich!         

214
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,531
         That's right!          

215
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,934
     It is I, Sourdough.        
      The evil sandwich.        

216
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,371
  And I have seized control     
      of yet another one        
       of your planets,         

217
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,940
         Lord Hater.            
          Oh, yeah?             

218
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,810
   Well, I didn't even want     
  that stupid planet anyway.    

219
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,946
   I got pleeenty of other      
planets that are waay better.   

220
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,548
         No, you don't!         

221
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,284
 Have you checked the villain   
     leaderboard lately?        

222
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:03,988
    Uh, yeah. I don't know      
      the exact number,         

223
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,224
      but I'm like waaay        
          up there.             

224
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,292
        Right, Peepers?         

225
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,494
Oh, the sandwich is right, sir. 

226
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,497
That was the last planet        
we had control of               
in this system,                 

227
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,334
which knocks us completely off  
the villain board.              

228
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,471
         You're more            
     of a "ne'er-do-well"       
       than a villain.          

229
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,406
    How bad are you at this?    

230
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,849
     Wow, you can't even        
        do that right.          

231
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,454
     How'd that work out        
           for ya?              

232
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,290
Sir. This is exactly            
what I warned you about         
in my report                    

233
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:42,327
entitled "Oblique Strategies    
for Successful Masters of Evil."

234
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,029
I clearly stated                
that the only to truly rule     
the galaxy                      

235
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,766
is through careful planning,    
precise focus, and hard work.   

236
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,002
         But, noooo.            
            You--               
             Me?!               

237
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,005
      Don't tell me what        
   being evil is all about.     

238
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,940
    It's about being all...     

239
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,342
          ( roaring )           

240
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,677
     Scary bad guy stuff,       
          not, uh...            

241
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,281
  blah blah meeting, staff,     
    business guy stuff...       

242
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:07,285
     Wow. I can't believe       
       I never figured          
       this out before.         

243
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,421
          The reason we've been 
          failing all this time 
                   is because-- 

244
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:13,491
You waste all our resources     
trying to destroy               
a happy-go-lucky do-gooder      

245
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,761
who just wants                  
to be your friend?              

246
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:22,400
                    Because you 
          and your boring plans 
     have been keeping me down, 

247
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,369
               Civilian Peepers!

248
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,838
Uh, sir, with due respect,      
it's Commander.                 

249
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,440
         Not anymore.           
        You're fired.           

250
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,849
      ( electric guitar )       

251
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,357
  Oh, this isn't happening.     
 This isn't happening. This--   

252
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,393
       ( incredulous )          
    This isn't happening.       

253
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:49,994
        He'll realize           
      he made a mistake.        

254
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,429
          He needs me.          

255
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,664
      Peepers, I need you.      

256
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,332
Of course, sir,                 
what can I do for you?          

257
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,703
                 Before you GO, 
                how do I, like, 
       find planets to conquer? 

258
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,840
             Are they just sort 
               of around, or... 

259
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,976
Check the intergalactic matrix  
   in the command console.

00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,413
        The red button

261
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,515
                   Thanks! Man, 
                  I'm so stoked 
           to be running things 

262
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,083
     without you getting        
   in my way all the time.      

263
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,718
           Anyway,              
  you're still fired! Adios.    

264

266
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,392
             Yes?               
    You know those eyeball      
         guys I have?           

267
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,494
            How often do I need 
     to change their batteries? 

268
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:26,497
They're not robots,             
they're watch dogs.             

269
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:30,401
              Oh, they're dogs. 
           Huh. So I gotta walk 
                   them then... 

270
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,836
They're not dogs either,        
they're--                       

271
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:35,540
    Gotcha. Robot dogs...       
     feed them batteries.       

272
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:35,540
    Thanks, buddy. I owe ya.    

273
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,409
      Not enough to save        
       your job though.         

274
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,946
        Peepers, wait.          
            What?               

275
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,650
            Look, I realize now 
                I may have been 
            a bit hasty before. 

276
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,951
( gasps ) You do?               

277
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,486
          Yeah, I almost forgot 
                    to ask you, 

278
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,787
                    what's your 
               log-in password? 

279
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,656
            I need to erase you 
               from the system. 

280
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:00,798

282

         Delete that.           

283

         Delete that.           
          Delete...             

284
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,075
        Actually, no.

00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,814
Yes, sir,                       
we sure have.

   could you just crop yourself

      I was in your way.

     you want to tell me first?
