229

   is the best you've got?      

236

      I'm talkin' about.        

246
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,263
  Why can't the rest of you     
     be more like Bot 13?       

247
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,235
          As for you,

       A Dominator probe?

00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,472
Still, the poor guy sure looks  
   like he needs some help.

           Friend?              
      That hunk of metal        

322
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,783
    is one of Dominator's       
           probes.              

323
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,518
         Well, sure,            
       on the outside.          

324
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,054
      And on the inside,        
  it's all lava and lasers,     

325
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:13,591
     and a computer brain       
programmed only for destruction.

326
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:17,395
   He also likes ice cream,     
and making silly faces, and--   

327
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:20,264
Wander! That thing              
is gonna signal Dominator       

328
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,967
to come destroy                 
this planet with                
us on it.                       

329
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,036
                  Oh, Beep Boop 
              loves this place. 

330
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,737
                 He would never 
                 do anything... 

331
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,673
     Volcanium X obtained.      

332
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,677
        System repair           
         in progress.           

333
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,054
...like that.                   

334
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:46,124
                     Beep Boop! 
                          Stop! 

335
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,093
      Please don't leave.       

336
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,895
  We had so much fun today,     
          didn't we?            

337
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,630
      We could have fun         
        tomorrow, too,          

338
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,298
         if you wanted.         

339
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,208
                      Beep Boop!

340
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,578
 Get a grip, buddy.             

341
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,313
That's an evil robot.           

342
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,115
              He's not evil.    

343
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,084
         He's my pal,           
      and he'll be back.        

344
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,653
         - I know it.           
   - Yeah, back to destroy      
         this planet.           

345
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,488
    We need to warn people      
      to get outta here         

346
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,090
       before Dominator         
          shows up.             

347
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,659
                I'm not leaving 
             without Beep Boop. 

348
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,327
    Wander.                     

349
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,965
        Bot 13, report.         

350
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,401
       You better have          
    something good for me.      

351
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,173
         What? No way!          

352
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,675
      No one planet has         
    that much Volcanium X.      

353
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,977
         ( evil laugh )         

354
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,881
 With all that, I could power   
   my entire army forever!      

355
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,818
Bot 13,                         
you are the man!                

356
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,687
I am gonna                      
rock this world.                

357
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:54,125
 Literally. I'm gonna turn it   
 into a rock about this big.    

358
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,032
      Where is the place?       

359
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,900
Bot 13,                         
display coordinates.            

360
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,702
 Bot 13?                        

361
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,905
Bot 13, I said                  
display coordinates.            

362
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,908
Access your stupid memory chip, 
and download your data file.    

363
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,311
         I built you,           
    and I can unbuild you,      

364
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,079
      you bucket of bolts.      

365
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,481
   The best things in life      
      are more than just        

366
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,217
     a list of their parts.     

367
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,887
            Bot 13!             

368
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:28,426
      - I am Beep Boop.         
           - What?!             

369
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,231
  No. No! No, no, no, no, no!   

370
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,567
       Cancel deletion.         
    No, reverse, reverse!       

371
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,237
            Noooo!!             

372
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,076
 You ruined everything!         

373
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,946
        You... you...           
      you piece of junk!        

374
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,353
   Oh, what a disappointment.   

375
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:14,605
       I am Beep Boop.          
      ( voice distorts )        

376
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,580
I thought Beep Boop             
would be back by now.           

377
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,814
                Hm, so did I.   

378
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,083
    Buddy, don't                
    you see?                    

379
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,953
He didn't sell us out           
to Dominator after all.         

380
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,422
     Maybe you really did       
   get through to that bot.     

381
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,791
        Huh. I guess so.        

382
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,860
Hey, look,                      
a shooting star.                

383
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,930
                 Make a wish.   

384
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:43,034
          Good luck,            
          Beep Boop.
