00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,416

67
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:37,416
          has completely altered

       of his prefrontal cortex!

mumbo-jumbo!

00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,023
Give it to me straight.         

71
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,325
        The gift has made him...

72
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,392
                    happy.

80
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:03,976
                If this spreads,

81
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,945
              the entire army   
              will be ruined!

          No, no, no,           
         it can't be.           

103
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,075
         Not...

   the entire army with joy,    

106
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,458
       killing any hate         
        they may have.          

107

    We have to destroy him      
    before he destroys us.

           Peepers,             
       assemble a team.

        B-B-But, sir...         

110
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,042
        All right, men,         
           split up!            

111
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,114
       Man, Pete, if we make it 
          out of here alive,

     It's worse than we thought!

142

     I repeat, Bone Daddy       
        is in the nest!         

173
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,473
        That was the coolest!   

174
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:08,473
        You stopped Wander      

175
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:12,477
       from infecting me        
      with the happies...       

176
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:16,181
        and this cocoa          
       is really tasty.         

177
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,382

       I'm saying this,         

179
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:22,487
     but you did something      
        right for once!         

180
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,489
        Good work, Watchdogs.   

181
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,191
          Sir, it was           
     the least we could do      

182
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,226
     after you gave us all      
 those thoughtful gifts, sir.   

183
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,161
 After I gave you?              

184
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,496
 But I didn't--                 

185
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,298
 Your gifts really encouraged   
    us to do our very best.     

186
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,467
A little positive reinforcement 
     goes a long way, sir!      

187
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,569
     We love you, sir!

00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,886
       to Lord Hater            
  and the Watchdogs!            

227
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,421
We've shared more adventures    
     with them than anybody.    

228
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,524
             Even though most   
          of those adventures   

229
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,392
               involved them    
       trying to destroy us?    

230
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,827
       The guy is a jerk!       

231
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,428
              I'm just saying,  
               maybe we should  

232
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,532
institute some kind of          
Naughty or Nice policy.         

233
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,801
                There's         
       an old Slarnian saying...

234
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,503
       ( guttural noises )      

235
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,505
                  Which roughly 
                 translates to, 

236
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,008
           "A little nice makes 
          naughty think twice." 

237
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,549
           "Sylvia,             
     this panel is loose.       

238
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:38,616
       Hugs and kisses.         
           Sylvia."             

239
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,421
If we give Hater                
the perfect gift,               

240
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,490
   maybe his heart              
will grow three sizes           

241
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,426
and he'll spread cheer          
throughout the galaxy.          

242
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,727
      Or maybe he'll try        
        to destroy us.          

243
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:50,795
        Again.                  

244
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,531
  I like our odds.              

245
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:53,531
               HATER: Watchdogs!

246
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:57,435
  All I want is for you guys    
   to finally do something,     

247
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,437
        anything, right         
           for once!            

248
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,772
        Is that so hard?        

249
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,508
                   He's gonna be
                    so excited! 

250
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,478
Yeah, that guy's just a barrel  
of sunshine waiting to happen.  

251
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,514
                   Exactly!     
                   Hmm.         

252
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,883
   Was it Conference Room 1     
    or Conference Room 1-A?     

253
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,017
                            1-A!

254
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,419
                     Thanks.    

255
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,487
      Hey, wait a minute!       
        Who said that?          

256
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,622
        Show yourselves         
       or I'll blast you        

257
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,591
       to bits and even         
         smaller bits!          

258
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,393
          It's not just about   
       giving someone a present.

259
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,896
       It's about giving someone
         the perfect present.   

260
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,531
                  Observe.      

261
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,402
            Huh?                
    What's this?                

262
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,504
    Read the tag.               

263
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,506
Okay, mysterious voice,         

264
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,809
    but I doubt there's any     
  new information on this tag   

265
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:38,910
          that would            
         cause me to--          

266
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,578
         Oh, my grop,           
         it's for me!           

267
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,514
                            Tim!

268
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,515
     The meeting's in here!     

269
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,817
               Perfect.         

270
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,886
               He's overwhelmed 
                   with joy!    

271
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,488
             A little nice makes
              naughty think...  

272
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,489
          Twice.                
     Slarnian...                

273
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,591
       ( guttural noise )       

274
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,594
Yeah, I know.                   
But if we're caught, we         
don't get to deliver gifts.     

275
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,430
We get to die.                  
So just promise me              
we'll be careful.               

276
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,666
             Deal?              
             Deal.              

277
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,701
             Let's do this.     

278
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,075
             ( gasps )          

279
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,611
          Happy.                

280
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,450
           ( sighs )            

281
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,085
           ( gasps )            

282
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,121
        Happy.                  

283
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,661
          BOTH: Happy.          

284
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:30,728
       Perfect.                 

285
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,745
            Eee-yaa.            

286
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,147
            Perfect.            

287
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,586
             Happy.             

288
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,788
                        Peepers!

289
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,590
                   What--       
             What is that thing?

290
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,961
       It appears to be         
     some kind of present.      

291
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,164
 But how-- Who would--          
What is wrong with him?         

292
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,867
                 ( laughing )   

293
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,737
 The gift has                   
made him happy.                 

294
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,740
   HATER: But the Watchdogs     
 have never been happy before!  

295
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,142
 PEEPERS: Well, they've never   
    received a gift before.     

296
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,078
     HATER: Peepers, what       
      are we going to do?       

297
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,681
       If this spreads,         
the entire army will be ruined! 

298
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,149
    PEEPERS: It's okay, sir.    

299
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,618
             There is no way    
this happiness is spreading.    

300
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,855
WATCHDOGS: Happy.               

301
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,056
                 Aah!           

302
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,226
         ( screaming )          

303
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,262
       WATCHDOGS: Happy.        

304
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:41,132
   PEEPERS: There's a serial    
   gifter loose on the ship.    

305
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,769
 HATER: We have to destroy him  
    before he destroys us.      

306
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,170
           Peepers,             
       assemble a team.         

307
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:46,170
       ( alarm blaring )        

308
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,574
              They're on to us. 
       We don't have much time. 

309
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,775
          Find and secure Hater.

310
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,677
                 Leave the dogs 
                     to me.     

311
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,745
        How?                    

312
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,580
                     I'll do    
                 what I do best.

313
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,849
           Be merry.            

314
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,524
        All right, men,         
           split up!            

315
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,928
          Man, Pete, if we make 
          it out of here alive, 

316
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,296
                    first thing 
                   I'm gonna do 

317
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,232
       is find that gal         
     I met on shore leave,      

318
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,834
        buy her a ring          
    and ask her to be mine.     

319
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,036
    Ah, you're crazy, Teddy,    

320
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,538
    Hater never lets anyone     
      have nice things...       

321
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,906
      like dreams.              

322
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,007
          Teddy?                

323
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,742
         Teddy?                 

324
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,843
         ( screaming )          

325
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,211
        Hang in there,          
      buddy, I'm coming!        

326
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,313
                 Oh, no.        

327
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,915
                     Teddy!     

328
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,051
                    Happy.      

329
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,752
          Teddy.                

330
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,687
       She's gonna              
     love it, kid,              

331
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,790
          she's gonna           
           love it.             

332
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,707
                       My dream.

333
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,210
                Perfect.        

334
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,211
                PEEPERS: Curses!

335
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,180
             Pete has succumbed 
                to the dance!   

336
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,353
         ( screaming )          

337
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,923
          Lord Hater,           
          let me in!            

338
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,157
          Please!               

339
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,192
          ( gasps )             

340
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,194
        He's gonna ruin         
         the surprise!          

341
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,600
         Perfect.               

342
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,336
         Commander Peepers?     

343
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,804
         C-Peeps?               

344
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,006
 Boo.                           

345
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,309
         ( screaming )          

346
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,977
                Sylvia, Hater's 
                  running away, 

347
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,312
               and we've got    
           to give him his gift,

348
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:34,312
               because if he    
           doesn't get his gift,

349
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,181
           he won't be filled   
         with the giving spirit!

350
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,816
 So come on and hurry up        
    if you will, please.        

351
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,817
       Thank you!               

352
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,786
   I hate today.                

353
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,987
         ( screaming )          

354
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,296
    ( continues screaming )     

355
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,474
             Ting!              

356
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,018
             Aah!               
       Stay back!               

357
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,821
           No.                  

358
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,756
        I don't think           
     he wants a gift.           

359
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:19,824
          No!                   

360
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,926
            He's just trying    
               to be polite.    

361
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,662
              No!               

362
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,099
                     Perimeter  
               is on lockdown.  

363
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,100
                  Clear!        
                  Clear!        

364
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,268
                 Bravo Team!    
             Secure Lord Hater! 

365
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,037
             Whoa!              

366
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,314
           That was the coolest!

367
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:43,314
             You stopped Wander 

368
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,384
       from infecting me        
      with the happies...       

369
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,320
        and this cocoa          
       is really tasty.         

370
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,321
       ( slurping )             

371
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,822
        I can't believe         
       I'm saying this,         

372
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:55,459
     but you did something      
        right for once!         

373
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,762
        Good work, Watchdogs.   

374
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,470
  Man, who knew those pathetic  
 Watchdogs could be so awesome? 

375
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,273
     Maybe all they needed      
    was a little niceness.

387

   All right, my now awesome    
Watchdogs, you know what to do. 

388
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,984
       Thank you so much        
   for your thoughtful gift,

391
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,324
       Go, my Watchdogs.        

392
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,993
         Go be awesome!

402

             Gaah!              

403
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,158
             No, no, no, no, no!

404
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,435
              No!

    that's enough hugging.      

412
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,142

   a little claustrophobic.     

413

        A little help.

        Watchdogs?

00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,984
        Wander?                 

417
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,120
    Okay, whose hand keeps      
       touching my butt?
