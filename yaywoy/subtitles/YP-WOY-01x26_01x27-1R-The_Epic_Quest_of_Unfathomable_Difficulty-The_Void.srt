THAT LAST PLAN                  

144
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,203
 WAS A LITTLE...TRICKY.

00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,309
            I CAN'T BELIEVE     
           THIS IS THE END!     

187
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,812
           AND ALL OVER A SOCK!

190
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,519
    NO.

191
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,421
TOO MANY LIKE--                 
      NO.

00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,324
             HAS HE EVER,       
             EVER LOST A SOCK?  

193
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,326
NO. OH, WAIT.                   
ACTUALLY,                       

194
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,195
HIS HORRIBLENESS                
DID LOSE ONE SOCK.              

195
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,131
SO HE BOUGHT A NEW PAIR.        
I MEAN, THEY'RE JUST SOCKS.     

196
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,166
WELL, TIME TO MEET              
YOUR DOOM. SEE YA.              

197
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,137
SYLVIA, I AM SORRY.             

198
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,439
I THOUGHT THAT GOING            
OUT OF YOUR WAY TO BE           
KIND TO SOMEONE                 

199
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,441
WOULD ALWAYS BE WORTH           
THE TROUBLE.                    

200
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,311
BUT I WAS WRONG.                
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.             

201
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,646
THIS   <i>IS  </i> JUST                
A DUMB SOCK,                    

202
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:45,517
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER           
A LICK TO ANYONE.               

203
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,690
         NO, WANDER. THIS SOCK

204
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:57,162
         AND I WILL NOT LET     
         THIS ENTIRE STUPID     
          QUEST BE IN VAIN.     

205
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,631

           STOP!                

209
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,449
WHO DARES?!                     

210
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,717
